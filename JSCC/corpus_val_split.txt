This sector is becoming increasingly large , as many people have already pointed out
It is also a transboundary issue
We must not create a Union only for capital - the Union must also be for its citizens
I heard Mrs Lynne say that this is also a problem for Sweden
As a Swedish Social Democrat , I disagree
This information must come from incorrect sources
We have agreements in Sweden in this area , which will continue to be applicable in the future
This is clear from Mrs van den Burg 's proposal
Naturally , the most important term of employment , pay , must be addressed
This is a case of discrimination regarding pay
This issue has already arisen in conjunction with the Par@@ t-@@ time work Directive
I also dis@@ like the idea of a six-week period , for this would allow shorter assignments , which only encourages cheating
The provisions should therefore apply from the first day
I also do not in fact like the idea of transition periods , but I accept them as a political necessity in order to get this through
Finally , I would like to say something about the members of the Swedish Moder@@ ate Party who will soon be speaking here
They are increasingly allying themselves with the Eurosceptic T@@ ory Party
They talk all the time solely about the rights of companies and never about the rights of employees
Company rights at European level and employee rights at national level - that paves the way for social dumping
It is then no longer a matter of social cohesion
Instead , a society and a Europe of conflicts is created
Ladies and gentlemen , I shall now suspend the sitting for two minutes , and then we will continue
( The sitting was suspended at 11
Mr President , I regret that the concept of social dialogue has been j@@ et@@ tis@@ oned by the Commission with this directive
It could even constitute gender discrimination
In relation to Article 5 , the reference to ' essential ' employment conditions is unclear and has no precedent in EU law
The Commission has departed from normal practice and the wording used in previous social dialogue agreements should be the tem@@ plate , rather than the views of only one social partner
The same applies to Article 6 and the matters governed by points 6
These should be left to the discretion of Member States
4 in Article 7 reflects a poor understanding of employment and commercial relationships
It is inappropriate to include reference to pay as an aspect of basic working conditions , given the limitation imposed by Article 137 of the Treaty
Six weeks is far too short a period to decide whether a temporary agency worker should be made permanent or not
All workers have a prob@@ a@@ tionary period
Mr Harbour has reminded me of our confrontation but I can assure him that our confrontations are always exciting
If they are accepted as they stand , workers will not in most cases receive the same wages as workers in the user company
Where is the balance between flexibility and balance and where is the protection for economic competition on the internal market ?
Mr President , temporary work agencies are a necessary part of the flexible labour market of the future
The recruitment difficulties of companies are solved to an increasing extent by taking on staff from temporary work agencies
Im@@ migrants often gain excellent opportunities to get a fo@@ othold in the labour market through these companies
It is therefore important to encourage and facilitate the activities of temporary work agencies
We have heard here that legislation regulating temporary work agencies varies greatly from Member State to Member State
It is therefore difficult to create even framework legislation which takes into account all the differences
The problems with framework legislation at European level are clear when one looks at Sweden
Here , the political starting points are not reflected in the actual conditions
In Sweden , permanent employment is the rule
Around 70 % of those employed through temporary work agencies are on permanent contracts
Ter@@ ms and conditions of employment are regulated by collective agreements for both permanent and temporary employees
The salary of whit@@ e-@@ col@@ lar workers is set individually and separately , which means that no pay comparisons can be made
B@@ lu@@ e-@@ col@@ lar workers have collective agreements guaranteeing that pay will not fall below the pay in the user undertaking and that the working hours of the user undertaking will apply
This is not regulated in law , however , but through negotiations between the social partners , as should continue to happen in the future
This is why we do not believe that pay should be included in the directive 's definition of terms and conditions of employment
Nor should comparisons of pay and terms and conditions of employment be regulated in the directive
The temporary work agency sector functions well in Sweden and could be a model for Europe
There you are , Mr Andersson
However , the proposal before us does not facilitate development of this sector in Europe
Europe needs more forms of employment , not fewer
Mr President , Ms Attwooll said that the rapporteur had been inclusive in carrying out this report
The situation now is a classic contrast between flexibility and protection
There is a need to understand the situation in countries where there is a less-@@ developed temporary agency worker regulation
That is why I welcome amendments like Amendment No 71 , through the efforts of the rapporteurs and others to understand that situation
We are not at extremes in this area
We are in a situation where there is evidence that those vulnerable workers looking to us for protection require that protection and good agency employers require growth and flexibility
It is a balance which should be struck
We want to find that balance
As Mr Hughes said , we are at the beginning of that process
Let us shape a directive that strikes that vital balance
Mr President , my sincere thanks go to Mrs van den Burg for the work she has done
For many years now Europe has clearly not managed to fulfil its aim to become the world 's most competitive economic area
Unfortunately , this proposal for a directive on temporary agency work will take us even further away from our objective
The Lisbon targets bind us to a more flexible labour market than before
Increased bureaucracy and interference in contracts between companies will constra@@ in the labour market
Do we not want supply to meet demand ?
Since the Treaty of Rome the EU has aspi@@ red to the creation of a dynamic Internal Market
The Member States take care of the social consequences of that by taking account of the interests of employees in the way they themselves consider best
This lies at the heart of the principle of subsidiarity
It is not the EU 's job to regulate sectors that do not require intervention at EU level
For historical reasons there are big differences between the labour market systems in Member States
One rigid solution in this sector will not suit everyone
If things have not been dealt with properly in Ireland , it does not mean that this directive should be employed to complicate things in Finland , where they have
This directive 's implementation will clearly worsen the general situation regarding temporary agency work in Finland
It would appear that , once again , no thorough cost-benefit analyses have been carried out
The results will ultimately be reflected in growing unemployment and weakening competitiveness
The committee 's decision to allow employment agencies to receive reasonable costs , however , is an improvement on the poor proposal put forward by the Commission
Ref@@ using to pay such costs would lead to the work of the agencies dis@@ continuing
Temporary employment agencies offer a flexible solution in the way they fill vacancies promptly and speedily in sectors suffering from a shortage of manpower
Under no circumstances should we make conditions worse for them
Mr Crowley has a comment on procedure
Mr President , Mr De Rossa mentioned me in particular and challenged me to an argument
That is a good suggestion
Mr President , I should like to start with three general comments
First , several honourable Members raised the question of subsidiarity
There is a whole body of evidence on subsidi@@ ar@@ ity; I should just like to make one very important point
So there is clearly a need , just as in all other sectors of labour legislation , for a common , flexible framework
My second comment concerns whether we evaluated the repercussions of this directive
May I remind you that this directive will apply to 1
Serious concerns were expressed about the model getting tied up in red tape
The legislation does not introduce any new procedures for recruiting or transferring workers and each country keeps its present system
Flexibility must not be interpreted as meaning fewer or no rights as a prerequisite to job creation
Specific references were made to Great Britain , to the effect that jobs will be cut etc
I should like if I may , Mr President , to comment on specific amendments in order to give the Commission 's position
There are two types of amendment
The first type clarifies the proposal and adds a number of definitions
The second type amends the proposal materially by adding or deleting certain important provisions
As far as the first type is concerned , I welcome the proposed new title
I think it conve@@ ys the objective of the directive much better
I agree with the amendment designed to convey more fully the triangular relationship between worker , agency and user undertaking in@@ n@@ ate in temporary employment
We support the amendments that redefine temporary agency work , the user company and the temporary work agency
We also accept the amendments that clarify the text
The definition proposed for the term ' assignment ' is far more accurate
The new wording for the group of workers that Member States cannot exclude from the scope of the directive is a vast improvement
I agree with the addendum specifying the means to be used to inform employees about any vac@@ ant posts in the user undertaking
I accept the amendment rewording the reference to social services more clearly
I also welcome the reference to collective agreements and worker representation because worker representation can indeed be set out in collective agreements
I agree with the amendment requiring the Member States to ensure that both workers and their representatives are equipped to press the provisions of the directive
That brings me to material amendments to the directive , which add or delete certain important provisions
I shall deal first with the amendments that are acceptable and then with the amendments that are not
I agree with the amendment extending the scope for lifting restrictions and prohibitions on temporary agency work
This scope was very restricted in the proposal for a directive , because it only applied to restrictions or prohibitions on certain groups of workers or certain sectors
I can allow the exemption for permanent contracts to be restricted solely to pay but I cannot allow this derogation to be extended to fixed-term contracts
This is a factor which will help significantly in the overall negotiations
The remaining amendments are rejected
May I again congratulate Mrs van den Burg and urge the Danish presidency to take whatever action is needed in order to reach agreement at the Council on 3 December
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the amazing progress that has been made in bio@@ logy and in molec@@ ular genetics is fascinating and disturbing at the same time
This represents a genuine sea change
An initial response was drawn up by UNESCO when , in November 1997 , by consensus it adopted the universal declaration on the human genome and human rights
Bio@@ technologies are part of the technologies of the future
The potential development of these gives us a glim@@ pse of major changes in the coming years in the medicinal products , food , agriculture and environmental markets
Nevertheless , these technologies , in their practical applications , raise ethical and philosophical questions that are now part of today 's culture
The classical hum@@ anism expressed in the famous phrase of the philosopher Sen@@ ec@@ a stated that ' man is sacred to mankind '
This classical hum@@ anism must inspire contemporary science and all citizens
The European Union has avail@@ ed itself in recent years of a pan@@ op@@ ly of directives and regulations in the field of biotechnologies and science
Nevertheless , the many legislative acts that have been adopted constitute a genuine ra@@ g-@@ bag , lacking a coherent , global and systemic vision of this vast sector
Some legislation that has been adopted has not been implemented and other legislation has been subject to derogations , moratoria and , even worse , numerous vo@@ ids and grey areas
The global battle in the field of biotechnologies is , nevertheless , crucial
The United States clearly lead the field in this area
to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world
How will this aim be achieved without a strong European commitment to biotechnologies ?
Europe is lagging behind the United States
This is a summary , Mr President , of the cultural , political , legal and economic context into which the Commission communication fits
This is broadly supported by Mrs Damião 's report
We will clearly not be able to achieve this with one wave of the wand , but they do point us in the right direction
I also warmly welcome the fact that the report has been produced on the basis of broad political agreement
biotechnology is the next wave of the knowledge-based economy and biotechnology research is crucial for strengthening European competitiveness in this field
There is a growing realisation among Europeans that this technology is important for our future competitiveness and welfare
A consensus is emerging on how we might strengthen its development in a manner consistent with our European values and ethical standards
As was made clear in the report that Mr Purvis submitted to Parliament last spring , biotechnology is an enabling technology
It affects , or can even transform , broad areas such as healthcare , environmental protection , agriculture and food and industrial production processes
Europe cannot afford to miss out on the benefits biotechnology will bring
The present downturn in the capital markets and the lack of risk capital needs particular and urgent attention
The success of the biotechnology strategy will only be assured if the technology is built on a basis of societal trust
It is vital for developments , and in particular public policy-making , to take place with a maximum of transparency
We need to encourage public dialogue throughout Europe to ensure that societal goals are met and public concerns are addressed
The strategy pursues the overarching goal of enhancing coherence between policies at the different levels
In this way , we can give proper , broad consideration to policy decisions that have an impact on our competitiveness and the future prosperity of our societies
The Commission has started implementing measures in its own areas of responsibility
We will shortly publish the first regular report on the stage reached in this implementation work
The adoption of Parliament 's report and the forthcoming Council conclusions will provide the essential political backing for the effective implementation of the strategy at European level
However , the proposed strategy lags far behind expectations
I would therefore like to thank Mrs Damião very much for her comprehensive report which clarifies the Commission 's strategy document in many respects
Europe must take on a pro-active role once again if it is not to lose ground in this sophisticated area of technology
This applies especially to ' green ' genetic engineering - in other words , to agriculture
A prerequisite is the establishment of an effective , predictable and stable legal framework , both for agriculture and for the biotech industry in Europe
This framework must comply , in particular , with WTO rules and safeguard the coexistence of all forms of agricultural production
The removal of the de facto moratorium for product approvals is the precondition for more planning security for companies and the agricultural sector
The moratorium is especially harmful to innovative SMEs in Europe and conflicts with the Lisbon objectives
Within the Commission , and within the European institutions , a targeted European policy to promote a ' B@@ -@@ Europe ' policy must be promoted
Based on the successful concept of eEurope , these same priorities could be pursued on an overarching basis by several of the Commission 's Directorates-General
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , I would like to send Mrs Damião my best wishes for her continued recovery
I would like to express my thanks to her and her colleagues , but also to Mr L@@ age , for their excellent cooperation
The Damião report sends out a positive signal for biotechnology , but it also makes clear where we need better rules than currently exist
The report deliberately does not paint a ' black and white ' picture
There is , after all , a view that genetic technology may be very positive in healthcare , but must be rejected at all costs in agriculture
The report rejects this position
We state quite clearly that there are opportunities in both sector@@ s; in other words , there are opportunities in agriculture as well
Indeed , the report says that genetic technology can contribute towards finding genuine solutions to sustainable development , and I would like to emphasise this point
This is why we are opposed to the de facto moratorium
The Directive on the deliberate release of GMOs into the environment was adopted a long time ago
The Member States should have implemented it in national law by October
The report says that it must end by 2003
I believe that it should actually end now , because the deadline for the implementation of Directive 2@@ 20/@@ 90 has already passed
Otherwise , SMEs in particular will suffer considerably , as Mrs Müller has already said
We see a danger , for example , in the uncontrolled use of DNA testing
DNA tests are not services like any other
A year ago , our group commissioned an expert report on this issue
This report says that the European Union has competence in this area
O@@ ffering DNA testing is either a cross-border service , or DNA tests are products traded in the internal market
This is why we need standards in this area , quality standards and standards relating , for example , to coun@@ selling
The Commission has a task here , and I ask the Commission to do what the report says , namely to initiate legislation
Mr President , I fully endorse the previous speakers ' comments , and I assume that there will be a majority in favour of the Damião report tomorrow
There are many reasons for this
The Commissioner is absolutely right to describe biotechnology as the undoubted key to the future
Some have grasped this al@@ read@@ y; others will take longer to do so , but it is undoubtedly the case
biotechnology will also help us find solutions for sustainable development
Otherwise , we would not grow old , but would leave this mortal co@@ il at the age of 15
In other words , biotechnology has many benefits , and this is widely recognised
Indeed , ' red ' biotechnology is already recognised by large sections of the Green Party today
how do we deal with green biotechnology ?
There is a very different view in the developing countries , however
It does not matter to us , because we can buy other products with our large amounts of money
What does this mean in practice ?
It means that the development of biotechnology , including green biotechnology , in Europe could help many other people
Let me clear up one misunderstanding at this point , which has also played a role in our own group
It has been claimed that we aim to combat hunger in the world with biotechnology
Let me clear up this misunderstanding from the outset
However , biotechnology can make its contribution to reducing hunger in the world
This is why I call on everyone to conduct a much more far-reaching dialogue here in this House , and with the Commission , on these issues
Otherwise we will continue to live with this dic@@ ho@@ tomy , which we are finding so difficult to cope with
Indeed , Mrs Damião 's report is warmly supported by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party
There are two points I should like to make
Despite being a key technology , biotechnology is still a poor relation in Europe and also in my own country the Netherlands
I therefore welcome the strategy of the Committee for biotechnology and life sciences , which is contributing to research and development in Europe
This does not , however , alter the fact that the committee has been overtaken by events
After all , did we not , in March 2000 , adopt the Purvis report whose intention was to improve the business climate in Europe ?
Did we not also criticise the Member States over the moratorium on the import of genetically modified products ?
There is still much to be done in Europe in terms of access to launch capital and to patent rights to create a favourable climate
The patent directive for biotechnological inventions is a demonstrable improvement
This directive from 1998 , however , has simply been ignored by the majority of Member States
It has only been implemented by four of the 15 Member States
What does the Commissioner intend to do about it ?
Another major obstacle to progress and application are the ethical and environmental concerns
It is of course entirely proper that we as legislators do not ignore these concerns of the consumer
The Commission 's action plan , however , already provides for the initiation of a social debate
It does not therefore seem necessary to me to strengthen this report with paragraphs that regulate communication with society in detail
We do not , after all , have to hold the consumer 's hand
The consumer is perfectly capable of making up his own mind if we provide the right information
Mr President , I should like to send my greetings to Mrs Damião in her absence and to wish her a speedy recovery
It also has incalculable effects on ecosystems
What this means is that organic farmers and consumers will not actually see this much vaunted but fic@@ tional freedom of choice
Furthermore , it reinforces the dependency of farmers and of Member States ' food policies on the multinationals
The degree of interference and pressure exerted on developing countries to introduce GMOs into their food chain is shocking
We only need think back to the much-@@ fe@@ ted ' green revolution ' of a few decades ago
We are committed to promoting the scientific and technological progress of mankind , but we must always respect the precautionary principle
Mr President , we increasingly see that when biotechnology is referred to , genetic technology is actually what is meant , but this is not stated clearly
For more than 20 years , promises have been made which have then been broken in practice
Gene@@ tically modified foods and agricultural products are a flop
The consumers do not want them
I often wonder why we have been discussing these key technologies here for so many years and why these supposedly key technologies do not succeed in the marketplace
Where is the market , in reality ?
Bio@@ tech companies are complete fl@@ ops on the stock exchange
We have no products which are successful and are accepted in the market
We have simply been ' talking up ' this genetic technology for years
Let me come to my real point
We have the Scheele report , and we have held a debate on the de facto moratorium
We also discussed the Fiori report in very wide and detailed terms , and it was made very clear that we do not want any patenting of human genes
The current report demands the very opposite
There is an obvious reluctance to accept the implementation of what has been called for , for a long time , in the other committees
I think we must recognise that we need absolute transparency for consumers , as well as safe foods
Then no one can claim that we are prepared to put the interests of industry ahead of consumer protection simply to push these products on to the market
With this in mind , I would like to state quite clearly , once again , that much of what is written here does not have our support
The Commission calls for this as well
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , although Mrs Damião 's report needs some modification , it is an excellent report
While highlighting the constraints on the development of biotechnology and life sciences , it demonstrates their role and importance to our society in a pertinent manner
It is fully in line with the approaches and strategies defined at the Lisbon European Council
Biotechnology and life sciences are undoubtedly key in building a more competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy
This report also throws all its weight behind the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Development , a programme I strongly support
Biotechnology will bring a new and broader dimension to the economy in future
It has implications for farming , nutrition , the environment , and , of course , medicine and the treatment of illness
Biotechnology also has implications for our competitiveness and the development of employment , increasing both the quantity and quality of jobs
However , this does not mean that a free rein should be given to research in this area
Biotechnology cannot be allowed to dominate over everything else
We are faced with an extraordinarily rich scientific field , many areas of which are still unknown and have yet to be exploited
There are two aspects to this area of science , but one of them does not always present what is best for mankind and the well-being of our societies
We must be wary of the sorcerer 's appren@@ tice
Life sciences should be supported and encouraged , but they must be regulated
I am sure you understand that I have in mind the problems posed by GMOs and research on human embryos
In this spirit , we must do everything possible to improve the financing of companies in this sector and to allow them access to risk capital
These companies are generally very young , often small , and therefore vulnerable
We must also encourage the development of researchers in our universities and facilitate their laboratory work within the spirit of the European Charter for Small Enterprises
Research forms the basis of our future competitiveness
We must also remember , however , we cannot have science without awareness
All sciences worthy of the name must be aware of their role in society
Biotechnology is certainly the key to a new society , which , if we manage it well , will be more just and more equitable
Finally , I would like to comment on how this affects developing countries
We need to uphold the principle of respect for others
Therefore we cannot consider imposing science and technology as a means of development
It is up to each individual to choose how they want to feed themselves and what standards they want to live by
Ladies and gentlemen , biotechnology is the third technological revolution for our society , following the industrial revolution and the information revolution
Mr President , firstly I too would like to wish Mrs Damião a speedy recovery and sincerely congratulate her for an excellent report
It will add to the encouragement which the biotechnology sector needs in order to realise its potential in my Scottish constituency and throughout Europe
The thrust of this report is fully in line with the Lisbon Summit objectives and continues the forward-looking attitude consistently demonstrated by Parliament
It should also serve to bolster the Commission 's new-@@ found courage as regards biotechnology and the life sciences
But how dreadful the contrast with the Council of Ministers who yet again this week demonstrated their abject failure to follow through on the goals they set at Lisbon
The grossly mis@@ ti@@ tled ' Competitiveness Council ' could not reach consensus about the proper jurisdiction for Community patent disputes
Without a cost-@@ efficient means of patenting intellectual property rights , what incentive is there for our scientists ?
This is only one example of the chronic foo@@ t-@@ dragging we see endlessly in the Council and by individual Member States
Mrs Damião , thank you for giving us hope that there is real hope in Europe for biotechnology and the life sciences
Mr President , the future presents both threats and opportunities
Biotechnology and life sciences are areas which arouse both fear and enthusiasm
There is good reason not to rush into believing that these offer solutions to all the problems we see before us
At the same time , we should not be frightened simply because we do not have the answers to all the questions
The Union has highlighted life sciences as an area which will help to make Europe the most knowledge-based and competitive economy
U@@ sed correctly , biotechnology can offer solutions to many of the problems we will all face
The fight against poverty and famine in the developing countries requires various initiatives in order to succeed
We should not overestimate biotechnology , but nor should we underestimate it
Cro@@ ps which tolerate different temperatures and levels of drought and rainfall may help to ensure that there is food in areas which currently experience famine
A society which seeks to develop prosperity and justice , and which wants more and more people to be able to live in acceptable environments must ensure economic growth
Many mature industries are failing today , which means we need new ones
Biotechnology is one such and one of the most promising
Let us within the Community invest common resources in order to continue developing together and moving forward
It is not enough to state that we have to be successful , we must also act
This involves adopting Mrs Damião 's report - positive action which bodes well for the future
Mr President , you do not have to be an implac@@ able opponent of GMOs - and I am not - to challenge the und@@ il@@ uted advoc@@ acy of them in this report
Many Liberal Democrats will be challenging the report in the vote tomorrow
We want to see a reduction in the use of pesticides and herbicides
We want to see insec@@ ts and wild plants flourish in our countryside
We want sustainable agriculture in developing nations
But we need to know that the proposed solution is not the cause of even greater problems
But where is the scientific evidence about the medium - and long-term effects of GM crops upon biodiversity ?
Who is going to compensate organic producers whose crops become contaminated and lose their value ?
We need answers to these questions before we open the floodgates
The debate is closed
I am hoping and praying for a united , peaceful Europe
I am therefore in favour of enlarging the Union to include all the current candidate countries , including Turkey
I abstained , however , from voting on the Brok report , because I believe that enlargement as envisaged by the report is taking place under very poor conditions
Neither the current Union nor the candidate countries are really ready
We all agree that the Treaty of Nice has not provided the Union with the necessary structures to operate properly with 25 , 27 or 28 Member States
The Convention , which should be perfec@@ ting these structures , is giving packaging priority over content
The financial block is therefore scheduled to take place after enlargement
There is a great risk of the enlarged European Union simply ending up as a free trade area , with no real solidarity and therefore no European integration
Before giving the rapporteur the floor , I would like to welcome Mr Maystadt , President of the European Investment Bank , who will speak later on
Madam President , let me first start with a word of welcome , also to Mr Maystadt
The EIB can play an important macro-economic role and underpin EU policy in key areas
The EIB is a public bank , accountable to the public for the policy it pursues
It is with these considerations in mind that I have written my report and I have emphasised a number of aspects in this respect
Today , I should like to single out five elements from my report
In its annual meeting of 4 June , the Board of Govern@@ ors decided to increase the capital by EUR 50 billion
Parliament welcomes this decision and believes that funding this capital increase from the bank itself is a wise decision
We condemn , however , the Board 's refusal to agree at this stage to a further increase in the next five years
I think that this fits in well with the image of an active bank which supports the EU 's goals
In that way , the EIB also becomes visible to the citizens
I should next like to turn to the subject of pension funds
In my report , I enlarged upon the role of the bank as bor@@ rower on the capital markets
The EIB plays a major role in this area too , particularly on relatively new markets , such as in some accession countries
With its tri@@ ple@@ -@@ A rating and long-term bonds in different currencies , the bank is a major protagon@@ ist and a very safe investment for pension funds , for example
A drawback is that EIB bonds are not always freely accessible
Government restrictions often apply precisely to investments made by pension funds and insurance companies
For example , the EIB could be an interesting partner for pension funds
This is why I tabled one more amendment before the plenary 's debate on my report , and I should like to invite the bank to play an active part
I should also like to hear Mr Maystadt 's opinion on the matter
The Amsterdam action programme has been more effective in drawing attention to projects in the social sectors
Since time immemorial , the majority of investments have been in the area of hard infrastructure
It is , however , also important to invest in social infrastructure
I would apply the two-pronged Lisbon objective , both economically and socially , to EIB policy
I am interested what Mr Maystadt 's intentions are in this area too
With regard to enlargement , we discussed the first round of the EU 's enlargement in Parliament on Tuesday
The EIB can also do its bit by giving a high priority to activities in the accession countries and by allowing those countries to take part as fully-fledged participants
I have a feeling that the new Member States take too little advantage of investment opportunities
It seems as if they are imposing restrictions on themselves because they do not want to run up excessive debts
A creditable ambition which can bring them closer to monetary union , but something against which I would put question marks at this stage
Mr Maystadt may be able to enlarge on this point too in his response
Finally , Parliament urges an intensified co-operation of the EIB and the E@@ BR@@ D on the basis of a well-considered and efficient division of tasks
In fact , this will be discussed in a separate report by Mr Markov in our committee and in this House in the foreseeable future
The importance of transparency and of the adequate supervision of the EIB group is something that has always enjoyed Parliament 's undivided attention
As a public investment bank , the need for adequate monitoring is obvious , but there is still room for improvement in this respect
As financial institutions , they are not subject to the normal prudential supervision that is set up for other institutions at national level
This monitoring at national level was the subject of a report which I supported here yesterday
I think that this can also play a part in the case of the EIB
A final point concerns the recommendations tabled by the Committee on Budgetary Control and I shall leave Mr Sjöstedt to put the case for these
I have given almost all of them comprehensive coverage in my report
the EIB is a policy driven public bank
Its task , as President Maystadt himself pointed out , is to contribute to the achievement of the political goals of the European Union in cooperation with the Commission
The Commission supports the EIB Group 's consolidation of its activities concerning SMEs
It agrees with the European Parliament 's point of view whereby the Bank should adopt the Commission 's definition of SMEs
Furthermore , again as required by the same decision , the Commission will submit an external assessment report to the Council and Parliament by the end of December 2004
the EIB has increased its financing activities in partner countries , working in close cooperation with the Commission
The Commission has given substantial backing to this initiative , pledging EUR 255 million of the Community budget over the next four years
Moreover , the EIB , again in conjunction with the Commission , is preparing to implement the new investment fund for ACP countries laid down by the Cotonou Agreement
As regards the Balkans , the Commission and the Bank are currently looking into the possibility of granting the Bank a mandate to operate in Kosovo
Once the agreement of the candidate countries has been obtained , this will enable the new Member States to be integrated into the EIB structure immediately after accession
Madam President , I want to say a few words about the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control regarding this report
My committee and I are grateful for the fact that the rapporteur and the committee responsible have chosen to take on board so many of the views we have presented
The European Investment Bank has for many years been one of the EU 's more anonymous powers that be
At the same time , the EIB has very great influence by virtue of the extensive loans both to the Member States and to the candidate countries
The reason for the European Investment Bank 's having been a fairly anonymous wiel@@ der of power in the EU is no doubt the special status of this body
It is a bank which , moreover , is basically owned by the Member States , at the same time as being a part of the European Union
We suggest , partly by means of the following proposals , that it be scrutinised more carefully
We wish to increase the Court of Auditors ' access to information from the European Investment Bank
In the long run , this access to information should be similar to the access that exists to information from the European Central Bank
This is something that can be brought about through the tripartite agreement , which is subject to future review
We should like to see increased cooperation between our committee , the Committee on Budgetary Control and the European Investment Bank
It should , for example , be possible to welcome the chairman of the bank to our meetings
We should also like to acquain@@ t ourselves with more documents concerning the European Investment Bank 's internal audit
We should like to see the environmental dimension strengthened through the EIB 's incorporating the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention and the obligations under it into its policy
We are concerned here with public access to environmental information
In a year or so , we should also like to see a progress report made on the task taken on in Gothenburg concerning impact on climate change
Finally , I just want to add that there is a need to evaluate the system of global loans which is at present a little too vaguely defined
A thorough evaluation needs to be made of the actual impact of the loans
Madam President , Mr Maystadt , this is the third time that Parliament has been able to give its opinion on the EIB 's annual report
The report by Mrs van de Burg is balanced and consistent , and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has therefore adopted it unanimously
I would nevertheless like to make some observations
First of all , I should like to comment on the role of the Bank
The role of the EIB is important
The Bank is a major investor on the European market and outside , with considerable macro-economic clout
This macro-economic clout does not require the EIB to have its own macro-economic policy
The agreement is that the Bank serves the EU 's goals
The Bank deplo@@ ys its investment funds in order to strengthen the EU 's macro-economic policy
In other words , the Bank 's mission does not require it to adopt a pro-active role
The EIB is to promote economic and social cohesion within the EU by financially supporting the goals which the European Union has in mind
As a result , the EIB naturally has macro-economic influence , and , indeed a great deal of it , but this influence is not a goal in itself
Creating employment is not one of the Bank 's tasks as such , but it is sometimes , of course , a side-@@ effect
The Bank 's task to modernise means the effect could also be the complete opposite , intensifying the eternal dilemma between productivity increase through high-@@ grade investments and employment
Given this dilemma , there is no point in setting up an extensive employment barometer
In my view , employment is not a goal in itself as far as the Bank is concerned
In other words , employment impact assessment should not take on the scale of the Bank 's environmental section
Sustainable environmental policy is one of the Bank 's explicit tasks
We are thus opposed to a comparison of the employment barometer with the environmental section
We will try to prevent the comparison between the two , suggested by the word ' similar ' in the amendment , by a split vote
We believe that the EIB funds should be used for investments and not for the system itself if this can at all be helped
Finally , there is the question of monitoring
At present , the Bank 's outgoings are covered by the EU Member States
It also generates money itself by issuing bonds
We hope that the amendments we have tabled will prevent the link being made to pensions in the final report
' ver@@ trou@@ w@@ en is go@@ ed , ma@@ ar contro@@ le is be@@ ter ' - trust is good , but control is better
This aim can only be achieved , however , through support for structural investments and is , consequently , unfettered by restrictions that could endanger these investments
The quality of expenditure , whether public or private , must be the guiding framework for investment policy and the European Investment Bank has an irreplaceable role in this framework
I congratulate the rapporteur on the content of her report and on having been able to interpret these aspirations
Madam President , Commissioner , Mr Maystadt , I want to begin by thanking Mrs van den Burg for the sterling work she has done
From having been , as Mr Sjöstedt pointed out , a fairly closed institution , the bank has since opened itself up to dialogue and the exchange of opinions
Crucial progress has been made within both these important areas
As we all know , nothing is so good , however , that it cannot be improved , and that applies too to access to information in several languages
Madam President , the rapporteur 's ambition has been further to emphasise the EIB 's overarching role in macro-economic and financial terms and in terms of political strategy
As you can hear , the EIB now already has more than enough on its plate
I would emphasise , however , that the EIB 's efforts in the Balkan countries , which are part of its remit , deserve increased attention
Where supervision of the EIB is concerned , we would repeat our proposal that the issues be addressed at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference
What does the EIB intend to do to disseminate further knowledge concerning the global loans , that is to say the loans to small enterprises ?
Madam President , as permanent rapporteur on loans and guarantees for the Committee on Budgets , I have only positive things to say on the whole about the EIB
What happened showed that the Bank is not just a financial institution but also a political playing field
The environment suffered as a result of the political games played by representatives of the Member States
The European Union guarantees a large portion of what the EIB lends and its loans in this respect do not carry any risk
A 3@@ A credit rating keeps the cost of borrowing low in other forms of fund@@ -raising on the part of the Bank
As the EIB has a good credit rating and the bad debt risk is low , it should adhere to stringent social and environmental criteria when granting loans
We have to promote aims that work for the common good
With that purpose in mind , the Bank must listen very attentively to the totally justified opinions of the NGO , Ban@@ k@@ watch Network
Our group backs the calls for improved monitoring of the Bank
Madam President , I warmly welcome this report
the distribution not of all funds , but only of funds intended to contribute to the achievement of the Union 's objectives
This institutional task has helped to create new wealth and to support entrepreneurial initiatives in the regions of the Union which are most lagging behind
The Bank 's efforts to support certain sectors , such as the environment sector , where EUR 5
9 billion has been allocated to environmental protection projects , are certainly commendable
The most important aspect for territorial development is still support for SMEs
In this case , partner banks which also distribute funds need to provide detailed information about the investments
In particular , Article 5 , which provides for 6 % to be paid in by the signatory Member States , should be amended
Mr President , I should like firstly to commend the rapporteur , and also Mr Sjöstedt for his opinion on this report
It is still a hard fight to obtain greater transparency and supervision where the EIB is concerned
The bank is still very unwilling to open its accounts and projects up to external supervision
It is almost impossible for the Court of Auditors to obtain access to documents
The bank always refers to banking secrecy or to the fact that the money does not come from the EU budget but from its own resources
I am extremely pleased , moreover , that Parliament is now making this demand
Why should the EIB have special status ?
That is something I absolutely cannot accept
I would compare the EIB with the go@@ blin@@ s ' bank in the Har@@ ry Po@@ tter books , namely a totally closed institution in which no one must interfere
I shall briefly mention the other four priority axes
Over EUR 13 billion of loans have already been approved within the context of this initiative
Another priority axis is environmental protection and improvement , with the objective of devoting between one quarter and one third of our total loans each year to environmental projects
Having thus briefly summarised the five priority axes for the coming years , I would now like to try to respond to the various speakers
I confirm that I will be available to give fuller , more precise answers at committee meetings
I would like first of all to respond to your rapporteur , Mrs van den Burg , who has put a great deal of effort into preparing this excellent report
In the United Kingdom , pension funds have already invested in long-term EIB bonds
Employment , which many of you have continued to focus on , clearly constitutes a final objective
In this regard , I share some of the reservations expressed by Mrs Peijs
We must , however , first solve one problem , which is that of medium-sized enterprises
The latter are in danger of being considered too large to receive global loans but too small to benefit from direct loans
When we have found the appropriate method for medium-sized enterprises , we will in effect be able to adopt the Commission 's definition
This agreement operates to the satisfaction of all three parties
In this regard , there is therefore no problem
These activities , naturally , also need monitoring
Moreover , it is in our interests to be monitored effectively , and we are already monitored by a verification committee and external auditors who report directly to the govern@@ ors
That said , I think it would be desirable to find a form of supervision that is appropriate for a bank
I have already said this before the House , and I confirm it today
We are entirely open to the idea , and even keen to be subject to a form of banking supervision
Furthermore , that is why we are following with great interest the discussions taking place on the possible creation of a European banking supervisor
Mrs Lucas raised some interesting points , but I have already exceeded my speaking time
I will be able to give her more information in committee , in particular with regard to the Les@@ otho project she mentioned
I shall be able to say more about this in committee
Mr President , thank you for coming here today and for the information you have kindly shared with us
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 12 noon
Madam President , in the short time available , there being two reports to be discussed , I will try to consider a number of different issues
First of all , I would like to thank the rapporteurs , Mr Herzog and Mr Lipietz , for their excellent reports
Once again , they both reflect Parliament 's overall support for European competition policy , support which is so important for the Commission and its departments
Allow me to set out the main features of our competition policy in the state aid sector
The Commission has continued its efforts in this sector in order to simplify , modernise and clarify the rules and practices
New regulations and Community guidelines have been drawn up
Another important example is the use of block exemptions , which allow Member States to grant aid without the need for prior notification
Block exemptions for small - and medium-sized enterprises and for training have been adopted and , recently , an exemption for state aid for employment too
I will now , if I may , respond to some of the points raised in Mr Herzog 's report
I firmly believe that the best way to promote overall Community industrial competitiveness is precisely to maintain a firm policy on state aid
state aid policy is criticised at times , in that it is said to be at vari@@ ance with measures seeking to attain certain Community objectives
In my view , this vari@@ ance is , in the majority of cases , more imagined than real
The aim of state aid control is to ensure that the positive effects of one particular measure are not counter@@ acted by the distortion in competition which the measure itself creates
I also endorse the view , expounded in the report , that we need to focus more on assessing the effectiveness and efficacy of aid
This is one aspect of the aid policy for which the Member States are chiefly responsible
As regards competition law , our activities have been characterised by our debate on the Commission proposal to update its procedural rules
It is expected that the Council will agree on the text of a new regulation next week
I would like to point out , moreover , that as regards updating competition rules , it was the Commission , three years ago , which took the initiative
As regards mergers , the number and complexity of cases which reach second phase investigations has increased rapidly
In 2001 , the Commission issued five prohibition decisions
Even though this is the highest number of prohibition decisions issued in a single year , this figure continues to represent only around 1
A detailed discussion on the consequences of these judgments for the Commission 's work would take more time than we have today
I would , however , like to make a few comments
Nevertheless , we should not allow these specific , individual cases to distort our view of the Community merger control policy
As you know , we initiated a vast reform of merger control procedures a long time before these recent rulings
We believe that merger control policy - just like competition policy in general - must be fair but , at the same time , strict
A major advantage of the European system is the short investigation times , as is widely acknowledged
Recent judgments have shown that the European courts exert strict , meticulous control over the Commission 's analyses in merger cases
Judicial control , which exists and is strict , should not , however , only be effective in terms of thoroughness , but also in terms of speed
In this respect , there is still substantial room for improvement , in terms of the speed with which judgments are issued
The Commission is willing - as we have already stated - firmly to support the granting of further resources which the Court will certainly need to implement these improvements
I must say that , following the publication of the Commission Green Paper , there were very few calls to abandon or make radical changes to the current system
Moreover , as you know , systems grounded on administrative decisions in this field are certainly not exclusive to the Commission
Indeed , this is the model used at national level , in the majority of Member States , and it reflects European legal traditions
in some fundamental aspects , they will completely transform the present system
That is why around 40 amendments , including , moreover , a dozen or so tabled by my own group , have been tabled for discussion in plenary
International action , to which you have just referred , does not present any more of a problem
We are in favour of establishing global rules
The report therefore emphasises the need to strengthen international cooperation in the field of competition
The majority , if not all of our colleagues are opposed to renationalising competition policy , and this is a strong political message
You have just referred to the recent judgments of the European Court of Justice
The issue we should be raising instead is the reorganisation of the Court of Justice
You mentioned various alternatives
The report describes the creation of a new legal chamber
I do not know what your opinion is on the problem of state aid , which is the subject of the report by Mr Herzog
If I understand correctly , next year we shall have a single report on competition policy and state aid policy
Another point of agreement of great political importance concerns the fact that state aid should , as laid down by the Treaty , focus on horizontal objectives
In committee , the disagreements tended to concern the way in which the objectives were defined and implemented
We have already discussed this with you at length
A great deal of progress remains to be made
I have just learnt of the conclusions of the Competition Council in this regard
We must work towards making the various actions of the Commission compatible and coherent with European policies
In this context , the opportunity for recourse to state aid in order to achieve these horizontal objectives should be reiterated
we need to strengthen the legislative role of the European Parliament in all aspects of competition policy
The report specifically calls - this work is naturally the responsibility of the Commission - for Parliament to have the right of codecision with regard to legislative procedures concerning competition
Two points have caused a great deal of controversy and a number of amendments concerning them have been tabled in plenary
There is a consensus within the committee that competition rules should be considered to apply without discrimination to all the Member States
The effective implementation of competition policy , however , has led to debate
The last point of agreement between committee members is their favourable view of the liberalisation of several economic sectors
Some consider that the processes underway are generally balanced and satisfactory , while others believe that these liberalisation processes do not comply with all the objectives of the European Union
Then there are our Amendments Nos 19 and 22 on services of general interest , both at international level - WTO negotiations - and national level
Lastly , Commissioner , I would like to hear from you
As you know , the Convention has already received a number of contributions on the subject of services of general interest
I note that the amendments tabled by Mr Evans and Mrs Riis-Jørgensen ruin that balance and in fact condemn any state aid in market activities
I therefore hope that these amendments will not be retained and that the balance achieved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs will be preserved in plenary
I worked together with the Directorate General for Competition , which very carefully manages state aid policy , and I am very pleased with how the dialogue progressed
Like any competition policy , the policy on state aid is facing new challenges
They particularly advocate redeploying aid towards the horizontal objectives
All of these Council decisions must be implemented firmly , but with discer@@ n@@ ment
I stress in my report that the effectiveness of horizontal aid must be evaluated
For example , the legitimacy of aid for research , the environment , training and employment is clear , and increases in this aid are often desired
However , it is not always effective in terms of the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives , and we should therefore move forward with our recommendations
It would be dangerous to ban any notion of sectoral aid , however
We are aware that the Commission has also itself opened the debate on the interaction of competition and industrial policy
The enlargement of the Union to the Central and Eastern European countries also poses difficult problems which must be dealt with fairly
A re-examination of steel aid is essential
Regarding services of general interest , a perspective of progress is emerging
The Council and the Commission are re-@@ assessing their interest for the Community
In accordance with the wishes of Parliament , the Court of Justice recognises that financial compensation , in return for the obligations imposed , is not aid
Ladies and gentlemen , the scoreboard is a step forward in achieving transparency and in the public debate , and we welcome this
However , the Commission is aware of the limits that we have highlighted
These are also areas to work on in the future , and in view of which , it would be desirable to increase the involvement of civil society
Allow me to add a few words on competition policy as a whole
Competition is essential for the viability and efficiency of the internal market
However , the European Union has a great deal of progress to make in terms of industrial and technological development
Experts already believe that its potential for growth in terms of production and productivity has slowed down , while we wish to speed it up
The process of mergers is only one aspect of the problem
We are aware that the general centralisation of powers within the DG poses a problem , but we do not want to swing towards the American model
Mr President , thanks are due to the Commissioner for the competition report , but congratulations also go to both rapporteurs for presenting us with their analysis of the issue
The competition report is based solely on the accountability of the Commission
This means that our comments carry about as much weight in the Commission as Economic and Social Committee opinions , and no more; we must be clear about this
This is not to say , however , that the Commission , which has been given considerable competence here , wishes to restrict its rights in the field of competition
Allow me to make a number of critical comments about the further development of competition policy per se
I know that we should not , indeed we must not , pin excessive blame for current problems on competition policy; I am clear about that
But what I wish to say is that the possible extension of competition rules to services of general interest would appear to me to be problematic
It is not for the Commission to define these on its own@@ ; it must be done by politicians in general
I hope that you will have sympathy for this view , Commissioner
We welcome the abolition of the notification requirement for competition agreements
I think this is a positive development that will reduce the administrative burden on companies and the authorities
We would , however , urge the Commission to fulfil a justified desire on the part of companies to obtain more legal certainty , particularly in complex matters
The modernisation of competition policy can only succeed if the competition rules are applied in a uniform and consistent manner across the EU
What we need is a European appeal option against decisions taken by national competition authorities
We would ask the Commission to take the necessary steps in this direction
trust is good , but control is better in cases like these
Thirdly , the network of national competition authorities requires a clear and transparent statute
At the moment , it is still unclear how cooperation goes on , and there is no real statute for it
I think that very sound and clear agreements are needed in this respect and I also believe that the candidate countries should be involved in this
Mr President , the control of state aids is one of the three pillars of competition policy
Secondly , in conjunction with this , we adopted a series of demands in the Committee on Industry , which are addressed to the Commission
Firstly , we welcome the objective of continuously reducing overall aid allocations
Secondly , we say that future sco@@ re@@ boards should include subsidies in the accession countries
Our third demand - and this is an old request - is for the thresholds applied to the ' de minimis ' rule to be raised
In the future we want the smaller cases to be exempted so that local decision-makers have more room for manoeuvre
In addition , we want the special tax arrangements to be subjected to more intensive scrutiny and to be included in this Scoreboard
We know that a Green Paper on the provision of services of general interest is currently being prepared
Our final point in the Committee on Industry is a long-standing demand on the part of Parliament
It concerns the regulations on which you have just reported , Commissioner , and which will entail an update of Regulation No 17
We want these regulations - including the forthcoming rules on services of general interest - to be classified as internal market legislation and to be subject to the codecision procedure
I know that this is not in your interests , but it is in ours
Nevertheless , we hope for your understanding on at least some of these points
Mr President , I am speaking today on behalf of Mr Evans , who is the shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group
He very much regrets that he cannot be here today
We have presented some amendments to these reports , with the general aim that they should provide more encouragement for free trade
Increased free trade and the reduction of unfair subsidies have been a most positive result
Encouraging greater competition is an enormous task
For the first three decades after the Second World War , state aid and protectionism were less controversial
It is still difficult to combat these traditional ideas and entrenched interests , especially in a climate where the opponents of free trade often have the cat@@ chi@@ er slogans
We are most grateful to him for his persistent and hard work in combating anything , be it cartels or subsidies , that impedes the operation of a fair market
The report by Mr Herzog concerns the newly-@@ introduced scoreboard for state aid
This is a most useful tool
We fully support its introduction and are anxious that it should be used enthusiastically
It is most encouraging to note that it points to a decline in state aid , although we would like to see a further decrease
The disparities between countries show that some Member States provide up to three times as much state aid as others
Mr Lipietz 's report focuses on general competition policy and we are pleased to see that it reflects many of our concerns
The report rightly congratulates Commissioner Monti and his staff on their approach
We in this Parliament should urge him further along the path he has chosen to take
I would like to conclude by commending the continuation of the European Union 's policies in these areas to Parliament
I hope Parliament will support our amendments and I look forward to even greater progress in the years to come
Mr President , the debate on the Annual Report on Competition Policy ought to be the most important debate on this subject to take place in the House each year
This is not always the case however
The explanation can be found in the nature of Parliament and its Rules of Procedure
They do not lend themselves to discussion of long-term issues
After all , this is a political chamber , not an academic body or a group of experts
To take an example , here we are at the end of 2002 debating the content of a Commission report relating to 2001
Many significant events have taken place since then
Given these constraints , any report by Parliament is unlikely to be a suitable document and provide an overview of the present state of the debate on European competition policy
I do not of course wish to imply any criticism of Mr Lipietz
He has done good work
Often these elements have little direct bearing on the main issue , which on this occasion is competition policy
Clearly , this is nothing new
I am sure Mr Lipietz would agree with me
When he appeared before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs he regretted the introduction of many of the additional sections and the rejection of other potential ones
I am therefore bound to agree with the rapporteur
Further to Commissioner Monti 's statement today , you should all agree on these shortcomings
In Mr Monti 's view , there are several serious problems in the area of competition at present
I refer to the three rulings
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , European competition policy and the Commission 's work in this field have been vital to the creation of the single market
Thanks to the introduction of the euro , it has become obvious that price differences between the Member States still exist
These , then , are some of the problems we should be tackling
It is unfortunate that we have failed to do so in the course of this debate
On condition that these amendments are adopted , we shall vote in favour of the report
I welcome the report on the Commission 's 3@@ 1@@ st report on competition policy
A competition court would increase the legal protection of European enterprises
A competition court would have to operate as a counterweight to , and supervisor of , the Commission 's experts on issues relating to competition policy
It would ensure that the Commission was no longer viewed as the body that both investig@@ ates and judges enterprises
It would make for greater transparency of the enterprises concerned
I absolutely do not want to see a weakening of competition policy in general
Nor do I want to see the Competition Directorate-General 's role in competition policy weakened
I am delighted that Mr Monti is well disposed towards a European competition court
I would also take the liberty of looking forward and commenting on the Commission 's motion for a resolution for reforming EU competition law
Throughout the reform process , the ELDR Group has supported the Commission in stating that reform is necessary
At the same time , we have maintained that this must not lead to a renationalisation of competition policy
I am confident that this network would be effective
At the same time , I would , however , put forward a proposal that I hope the Commission will consider
This is a large and important task that will become still greater with the forthcoming enlargement
I shall go into this in more detail in a letter to the Commissioner
Mr President , Commissioner , now that the internal market is complete , our regions are obviously operating in a more competitive environment
That is why it is necessary constantly to improve European rules in this field
Since , however , the European Union does not exist in isolation from world trade , a competition system is also needed in the WTO context
Competition policy must champion the concept of equal opportunities
In short - and this brings me back to where I started - competition policy is about creating an equ@@ ilateral triangle around economic policy , social policy and the environment
Mr President , the report by our colleague Mr Herzog is excellent , and the amendments tabled by our group only add to it
I am therefore surprised , as in a way it is the whole human aspect of this report that is deleted by those amendments
You are aware that the Treaty establishes that aid provided by Germany to regions of East Germany is in line with the single market
Our colleague quite rightly states that this aid could be allocated to regions of the candidate countries
Mr President , in sport , an opponent is needed in order to win
Football is such a sport , which can only exist by virtue of there being an opponent present
In a fair game , an opponent should have the same means available as the other party
This is , after all , about fair competition in which a battle can be fought for first place , but also for honour
In professional football we have noticed , in the Netherlands for example , how a Commission measure on state aid triggers reactions
However , in my view , this reaction over@@ sho@@ ots the commercial goals pursued by professional clubs
In my opinion , the granting of state aid is , and continues to be , a measure which is explicitly temporary in nature
If aid is granted for a longer period of time , then competitiveness becomes distorted
An ai@@ d-@@ based relationship of dependence between industry and government is an interference in the functioning of the market
I would also at the same time acknowledge the positive effect state aid has
After all , if thanks to a temporary measure , socially useful goals are achieved , temporary aid is quite justified
This is to give companies an incentive to achieve such goals
I should at this point like to draw your attention to the importance of granting aid in order to implement environmental legislation
It is a fact that industry is hit by high costs as a result of a plethora of new measures
With regard to the accession of the candidate countries , a new chapter should be added to competition policy and the question of state aid
A number of candidate countries provide foreign investors with favourable fiscal conditions
This is with a view to protecting local employment
Paragraphs 17 and 18 of Mr Herzog 's report expressly refer to the issue of aid to the steel industry in different accession countries
In this connection , I am of the view that Amendment No 16 concerns a change that leaves no room for doubt
I would call for the unambiguous and fair treatment of the candidate countries with regard to state aid and competition
A clearly defined exemption position gives the new Member States the scope to improve healthy economic relations
I should like to conclude with a question to Commissioner Monti
Over the past couple of years , it has become clear that the accession countries have an economic structure that is different from that of the EU Member States
This structure and mentality change less quickly than we would like them to , so the accession countries require an approach custom@@ ised to the needs of each of them
Applic@@ ation of the rules in full is a measure that does not do any justice to the development of a social market economy in the accession countries
How do you propose to find a fair solution to the problem of state aid in the accession countries ?
Mr President , the Treaty establishing the European Community does not prohibit dominant positions , only the abuse of them
It does not establish a system of prior approval for mergers
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as you can see we have before us a whole host of topical matters and decisions related to competition policy
do not be too dis@@ concerted by what the previous speaker has just said
This really is far removed from what the vast majority of Members of this Parliament thinks
I believe that the vote on the two reports later on will also show that we do not agree with what has just been said
That is why I am very pleased , Commissioner , that you also mentioned this principle explicitly in your introductory remarks and expressed your support for it
It is good that there has again been a decline in state aid
This is the result of the Commission 's tough aid control policy
It is true that the most competitive region , which is of course what we want to be , has to distinguish itself by having competitive companies
This means that the companies should manage as far as possible without aids and that any aids have to be directed at increasing the competitiveness of these companies
If you wish to apply qualitative criteria it is not enough to focus solely on one single company
My second point concerns a request that I wish to make in the field of regional policy
Today we are already discussing how regional policy will actually work after 2006
Much will change for the present EU of 15 , for the old Member States , and it is right that it should
But in this context we really do need to consider how we are going to re@@ balance regional aids across the Member States
We need to discuss this and we need to do it in good time
We might conclude that everything can stay the same , but we might also conclude that we need a new mechanism of some kind
Do not make us wait until the end; let us start this discussion now
In my view , a competitive economy open to competition would bring tangible social benefits in the European countries
With regard to state aid , in particular , Europe is set to face an extremely important challenge over the next few years in the current negative economic climate
a perilous path to take
Mr President , I will close by saying that the Italian Radical Members will vote for the Riis-Jørgensen and Evans amendments , which will make the Herzog report more balanced
This should improve supply to the benefit of producers and consumers and finally it should also act as an incentive to promote technical progress and maximise the national product
Obviously we all consider market power and processes of concentration to be damaging
Finally , this policy must also be brought into line with the Lisbon process and its objectives
That is why the annual report is certainly a successful report and it is also positive that for the first time it addresses the issues surrounding services of general interest
In this context , I welcome the fact that you wish to put the public service guarantee on the same footing as the principle of free competition
Commissioner , you were right to say how important it is to control cartels and mergers
But these court rulings do not in any way dent Parliament 's confidence in the Commission 's competence , which has been amply proven over the years
Commissioner , I should like to ask you to take greater account of workers ' rights in your merger control work
The view that competition policy is the sine qua non to job creation has proven to be misguided , because exactly the opposite is happening in practice
The MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece support the workers standing up against and opposing this liberalisation
We will vote against the three reports by Mrs van den Burg , Mr Lipietz and Mr Herzog , which complement each other in the field of so-called competition policy
We are in favour of defending public services that are useful to the population
We are against the state being used as a cru@@ tch for private capital
Competition policy is supposed to protect European consumers , lead to fair market prices , create increased supply and increase all market participants ' dynamism and capacity for innovation
Competition policy prohibits both State and private monopolies
It fights measures that distort competition and it is a precondition for all companies to have fair opportunities in and on the market
We are on the right track , but unfortunately we have not yet reached our goal
We are on the right track because we are seeing a fall in the number of cases investigated and because there has been an increase in the fines imposed
Mr President , I very much appreciate the strong across-the-board support expressed by this House for a vigorous competition policy in Europe
It is an enormous task , as Mr Purvis stressed
I also note the willingness to keep the European Commission as the decision-making body , under the judicial review of the courts
We should be thanking you for your efforts under such conditions
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12
Ladies and gentlemen , within the framework of interparliamentary relations , it is my great pleasure to welcome a delegation from the Syrian Parliament
The delegation is led by Mr Ab@@ du@@ l K@@ ad@@ er K@@ add@@ oura , Speaker of the Syrian Parliament
This is his second visit to the European Parliament
In welcoming Mr K@@ add@@ oura and his delegation , I should like to highlight the importance we attach to this visit
It is the first of its kind to the European Parliament since 1983
Syria is the last remaining country in the Mediterranean basin with whom an Association Agreement has not yet been finalised
Negotiations between the Commission and Syria have been continued since 1997
I am informed that a very positive atmosphere reigned at the most recent meeting , last week
Further , contact between the Syrian Parliament and the European Parliament could trigger ongoing dialogue within the Euromed Forum
We trust this visit will help to strengthen links between the European Parliament and the Syrian Parliament
Mr K@@ add@@ oura , I very much hope that the meetings you and the members of your delegation held proved fruitful
I hope too that they will signal the start of a new era in which the people of Syria and the European Union will come closer to each other
Mr President , yesterday we held a debate on Mrs van den Burg 's report on temporary work
This debate lasted from 10 p
and 28 speakers took part in it
When I asked this morning whether there was a video recording of it I was told that there was not because proceedings were only filmed up to 8 p
Mr President , we say that we want to treat all debates alike and yet those whose reports are debated after 8 p
are always at a disadvantage
Transparency is not guaranteed
We are there@@ ; the interpreters are there@@ ; only the audiovisual service cannot be there because its resources have been drastically cut
I consider this to be an unacceptable situation
I think that your comments , which were also a complaint , should be carefully considered
I hope that you will receive a positive response
Is there by any chance some new scare about new ger@@ ms spreading here ?
I would ask the Quaestors to investigate the matter
Mr President , we propose to reintroduce , from the original Commission text , the words ' after consultation of the social partners ' in the first sentence
Mr Pronk , do you have any objections ?
Mr President , it is possible but we have to say ' where appropriate after consultation of the social partners '
Mr President , this amendment has nothing to do with stem cell research
It deals exclusively with the issue of human cloning
The wording I have used is taken from Parliament 's own resolution of September 2000 on human cloning , where we called for a universal ban
The debate has already taken place
I think that the intentions are quite clear in the text
Mrs Damião has been suffering from quite a serious illness
Consequently , she has not been able to attend this vote or be involved in drafting the report
Mr President , I thought that Mr Herzog would present the oral amendment in his text
' welcome the bank 's commitment to improved transparency and efficiency of its global loans and its response to critical questions regarding these instruments '
That will be the first line
It is the Greens
Sor@@ ry , I am mixing it up with another report
We withdraw the first part of the amendment , which deleted three words , therefore we retain the terms in the report ' financing the economy '
Although this Solidarity Fund is a necessary guarantee , it is not a sufficient one , however
Providing aid to the victims of such disasters should not prevent detailed consideration of their causes , our production methods and economic orientations
On the contrary , it should encourage us to radically question our economies of profit
These economies produce small profits for shipowners registered in Panama , recruiting F@@ ili@@ pin@@ os and flying the flag of Gibraltar
' I am pinning my hopes on the Council 's good judgment '
The Interinstitutional Agreement that is now before us is clearly better defined than the draft in Parliament
I should like to illustrate this with three points
The first one is the Interinstitutional Agreement 's scope
This is largely confined to major natural disasters , with good reason
In the case of disasters of other types , those responsible will be held liable
The raised threshold focuses the scheme on major disasters and holds out the prospect of this resulting in substantial aid to selected regions
5 % limit ensures that the lion 's share of the Fund reaches its actual goal
The Commission has now made the first proposal for granting aid from this Fund
The current situation will then improve on all fronts , with regard to both the affected states and longer-term mutual solidarity
This is why we have endorsed the Interinstitutional Agreement , albeit with reservations
I voted in favour of the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund
This vote is the realisation of the fast legislative work that has been done since the proposal was presented by Commissioner Barnier on 18 September
I would also like to thank him for his efforts in this matter
When the political will is strong enough , Europe can move forward quickly and effectively
I only regret that we did not reach the same result following the terrible storms in 1999 , which hit France hard
Today , we can only welcome the mobilisation of this new European instrument of solidarity
The EUR 7@@ 28 million will provide additional comfort for the families that have suffered as a result of the natural disasters in the summer
They know the price of solidarity and appreciate , I hope , the gesture that Europe has made today
Mr President , the proposal for a Council recommendation with regard to the prevention of tobacco smoking only partly corresponds with my views
In some areas , the Commission goes much too far
In addition to the many prevention and control aspects , this recommendation also aims to regulate tobacco advertising
Why is the Commission tabling two texts both of which intend to impose restraints on advertising ?
Surely it cannot be the intention that advertising other than that promoting tobacco should fall within the scope of this recommendation ?
It is very unfortunate that Parliament is not considering brand diversification businesses
These are predominantly specialist , and often very small , businesses that use an existing brand to market new products
I am happy to leave it to children 's parents to decide about this issue
In this case , it is the form that is dangerous , and not the content
I think it should be the other way around
We have chosen to refrain from adopting positions on quite a few parts of the report
Several of the proposals are such as not to require any common policy at EU level
B@@ ans on cigarette machines and rules governing gifts and self-service in shops are better drawn up at national level
We consider bans on food made to look like tobacco to be a case of unnecessary regulation
The EU should instead immediately abolish the extensive subsidies it pays out for the cultivation of tobacco
I am thinking in particular of information campaigns and programmes to treat addiction to smoking
The amendment seeking to introduce measures against invol@@ untary exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in indoor workplaces , enclosed public places and public transport also enhances the recommendation
I particularly welcome the call to promote economically viable alternatives for tobacco growers and to promote the gradual replacement of subsidies for raw tobacco with alternatives
Obviously we cannot simply take these producers ' and their families ' daily bread away without offering them an acceptable alternative
I am not especially happy , however , with all of the recommendations in this report
In the United Kingdom a packet of cigarettes costs twice or three times as much as it does in Luxembourg
At the time when this proposal was put on the agenda , support from an overwhelming majority was already guaranteed
This support is much wider than was the case for previous proposals on the subject of tobacco
Perhaps this is because it cannot be objected to on legal or economic grounds
I have come un@@ stuck on this point before , when I made proposals for protection against asbestos
This time round , the Council has already made known to us its lack of interest in Parliament 's opinion
I endorse the proposals against smuggling , cinema advertising , and chocolate cigarettes , but do not hold out any high hopes
These proposals are hypocritical and underhand and run counter to consumer interests and public health , given that 70 % of the European Union 's tobacco is imported
Consequently , abolishing aid for Community production will not reduce smo@@ king; it will merely make us dependent on imports and flood the European market with tobacco from third countries
It also presents a range of proposals designed to deter smoking , particularly amongst children and adolescents , which can only deserve our support
Smoking kills , the litany is becoming tiring
I will therefore take the liberty of irritating some people by repeating that smoking kills one in two smokers
There is no doubt that those who do not want to hear it are tired of it
According to the evidence , however , it does not scare people
in Europe , 500 000 people are struck down by this plague each year
In Belgium , 33 % of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 are regular smokers and 51 % have smoked
More serious is the fact that a quarter of women have tried their first cigarette before the age of 15
In short , young people are smoking more and more , and currently no anti-@@ smoking policy is capable of curbing this infer@@ nal trend
The risk is established , the symbol is disastrous , and all for a quite laughable market
The Commission is proposing to make the regulations on additives in animal feed more coherent , and we approve of that approach
We also share the principle of continuing to consider coccidiostats and his@@ tom@@ ono@@ stats as additives until we find other methods of protecting animals against those illnesses
However , we await proposals from the Commission that will assure us that the same requirements will be applied to imported meat
For this reason we cannot vote in favour of the report
In fact , this proposal is intended to regulate additives intended for animal nutrition , clarifying existing rules in this field and consequently the authorisation procedures for their marketing
I think it is entirely appropriate to promote strict quality standards for additives intended for the nutrition of animals that are in turn intended for human consumption
The question , however , that bother us is how herbal medicinal products are to reach patients and consumers
The second question which arises is whether these medicinal products should be sold through pharm@@ acies and by qualified pharmac@@ ists or whether they will be available on supermarket shelves
Probably the latter , it would appear
We are counting on the national authorities to provide this support and , confident that they will do so , we have given our vote to Mr N@@ istic@@ ó 's report
Mr President , last night I dreamt about Mrs van den Burg
It was 40 years in the future and so she was in her sixties
You can wait , ' and so I have not found a job in the last 40 years
Therefore , in your explanation of vote , urge the House and Mrs van den Burg to do something about this part of the report too
This vote entirely distorts the spirit of the directive on temporary work
Equal pay for equal work , certainly , but the key issue is the reference point
the company employing the worker was the reference point
Now , the salary of a temporary worker would have to be assessed according to the scale of salaries in the temporary employment agency
Integration cannot be legislated
Temporary workers have more accidents than other workers and suffer more harassment
They pay very dearly for their status
The social reality is intractable
If they are paid less for identical work in a company , they will lose any chance of being integrated into it
And this directive , which is dead before it is born , will certainly not bring them justice
The intention is to create dependency by preventing people from moving on to permanent positions at the businesses that originally hi@@ red them
The two largest groups have reached a compromise that prevents the more far-reaching protection that my group has proposed
In doing so , they are hoping to cut costs and increase temporary work
I can only vote in favour if they are frustrated in what they seek to do
With this proposal for a directive , the Commission is seeking to regulate working conditions for temporary workers in the Member States
It would seem that this proposal for a directive does not have a sufficiently sound basis
Also , this field is the sovereign responsibility of the Member States , which are undoubtedly in a better position to assess the situation of their labour market
This is why I cannot vote for a text which , far from achieving its objectives , runs counter to them
The UK delegation of the Labour Party recognises the serious UK Government concern over this directive
It is important to strike a balance between protecting agency workers and avoiding burdens that could stop business engaging them , particularly for short-term assignments
Temporary Work Agen@@ cies make an important contribution to the employment market in the UK and should not be penalised
Increased administrative burdens could lead to increases in costs , which could be passed onto user organisations or cause the closure of the business and job losses
The EPLP has thus voted against Amendment 42 calling for the deletion of the 6-@@ week derogation from the original Commission proposal
It feels that it is important that at least a 6-@@ week derogation remains in the proposal
The EPLP voted for Amendment 73 to support comprehensive and effective impact assessments
The EPLP submitted and supported Amendment 71 , calling for an extra transition period for the UK
The EPLP has supported this report at first reading but with the strong reservations set out here
The main reasons for using temporary workers and temporary employment agencies concern the need to deal with temporary variations in demand
Statis@@ tical information , therefore , shows that plac@@ ements in user companies are usually extremely short@@ ; between one and six months
These , in short , are the reasons for my vote against this report
In fact , as the rapporteur acknowledges , there are some aspects on which the social partners involved have to date never reached agreement
This protection already exists , in fact , in various regulatory instruments
Who can honestly be satisfied with the results of the EU-Russia Summit ?
We cannot acknowledge these results
We support the right of the Chechen people to self-determination even more strongly
In short , we cannot vote in favour of the joint resolution of the European Parliament authorising and legitimising military operations in Chechnya
This and this alone is the reason why I have voted against this motion for a resolution
We could have voted in favour of this joint resolution , as it contains a number of sound recitals regarding General Musharraf 's military regime in Pakistan
However , the condemnation does not go far enough
Paragraph 2 legitimises the regime following the recent elections in October 2002
These elections were not democratic
They were conducted like a commercial transaction
The rich were able to buy votes from the poor without the electoral commission being able to stop them
The military at all levels put pressure on the local administration to help their preferred candidates
These elections were about encouraging politicians to follow the instructions and recommendations of the military , the ' new ' allies of imperialism in the region
continuing with privatisations , de@@ regulations , withdrawing collective agreements and mass unemployment
According to the institute for planning sustainable development in Islamabad , 6
8 million Pakist@@ an@@ is fell below the poverty line during the last three years of the Musharraf regime
It is the IMF and the World Bank who really give the orders in the regime
There is no mention of that in this resolution and the condemnation of the Musharraf regime does not go far enough
'@@ We are already doing that , ' I replied
'@@ No , I 'm very worried that there are groups of people who , in one way or another , are against cures for all diseases
It has been said that to think the worst of someone is a sin , but usually you are spot on
Mr President , I voted against Mrs Damião 's report because Amendment No 23 was not adopted
I am in favour of maintaining the moratorium on genetically modified food , but on no account do I oppose research and biotechnology in general
The main battle in this war is being fought with GM foods and a race is being run here with the Americans
Who cares about the risks inherent in mess@@ ing about with life and making artificial changes ?
Who cares that it is impossible to predict the effect these organisms will have on our planet 's sensitive ecosystem ?
The responsibility for prevention has been shifted straight on to the consumer
This is why the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece voted against the report
We Swedish Moder@@ ates welcome the positive attitude adopted by the European Parliament and the Commission on life sciences and biotechnology in this report
We would , however , emphasise that diversity and a wealth of ideas provide the best impetus to successful research
This principle should not be lost through EU coordination
Research policy within the EU must be based upon the principle of subsidiarity
Research cooperation between the Member States is good , but the EU must not take charge of it
Except in the case of its own research programmes , the EU lacks competence in the research area , and that is how matters should remain
We have therefore voted against the proposal for a special Directorate General with chief responsibility for coordinating the biotechnology strategy
We are in favour of the development of life sciences , biotechnology and , more broadly , of science in general
We reject , however , the many direct and indirect indul@@ gences in the report of private companies
We also reject all the calls for public funding in the interests of private capital , even if those interests are hidden behind the needs of research
We therefore abstained from voting on this report
I voted against Amendments 31 and 37 as the wording would be interpreted to also include a ban on therapeutic cloning , which I support under proper ethical conditions
I do not support the cloning of human beings
Mr President , the document concerns the European Investment Bank annual report for 2001
Parliament is right to highlight the impact of the EIB on the growth of SMEs and on employment , particularly through risk-@@ capital transactions
This impact must be reinforced by operation structures for access by SMEs
In particular , the invitation made to the EIB to adopt and apply the definition of SMEs established by the Commission is essential for access by the smallest SMEs
In the same context , increasing investments in the field of accommodation will enhance the important construction sector
To avoid this problem , all we can do , as I saw just now when I closed my eyes , is to undertake to build brick houses
The implementation of careful supervision rules in the European Union will protect saving and give people confidence in investments in stocks and shares
The globalisation of risks should further encourage the European authorities to develop supervision rules at international level
Other , broader initiatives , should not , however , be ruled out
This report is based on some facts and on one basic misunderstanding
The appeal to national authorities to cooperate more closely in the fight against so-called whit@@ e-@@ col@@ lar crime is certainly to be welcomed
We all agree that tax evasion should be stopped
Everyone should fulfil their duty to pay taxes
But this is no reason to confuse tax evasion with tax fraud
There is a clear distinction between the two
That is why I tabled an amendment in this regard in committee , but unfortunately it was not adopted
The same amendment was tabled in the plenary on behalf of the PPE-DE Group
This amendment also deletes the reference to the practice of black@@ listing countries if they do not yet adhere to the various international standards in the field of fighting whit@@ e-@@ col@@ lar crime
You would think twice before putting the USA on a list of this kind
During the time when share prices so@@ ared sk@@ y-@@ high , these mag@@ ic@@ ians were even allowed to line their own pockets quite hand@@ some@@ ly with share option schemes
Moreover , they are being encouraged to take on important government functions in the areas of postal services , energy supply and public transport
Meanwhile , we have been able to witness in America what these mag@@ ic@@ ians are capable of
In some cases , the successes ascri@@ bed to them and the options paid out to them are based on for@@ ger@@ ies
Measures are now being taken in America to increase control , not so much to curb the omni@@ po@@ tence of large companies , as to restore investor and consumer confidence
An initiative of this kind is also currently being proposed for the EU
My support for it is mainly due to the lack of anything better
Without changing the way in which the economy is organised , even the appointment of large numbers of inspectors would not solve the problems
We would then be wasting Community funding on bureaucracy
The unprecedented crisis in the financial system is the result of the deep economic crisis in the capitalist system and the clash of interests and acute competition between monopolies
'@@ Cre@@ ative ' , ' constructive ' accounting has been well and truly adopted even in national accounts as a way of deceiving citizens
We are here to highlight the political dimensions of the economic crisis as we fight with the workers to overturn this rotten system
These liberalisations should be genuinely set in motion so that they are perceptible to households
we disagree with its call for State aid to be reduced and with its misguided approach to State funding of private providers of general interest services;
we disagree with the report 's support for codecision in competition policy
On the contrary , we call on citizens to rise up against such a plan
In general , the Commission 's approach aims to make such policies entirely impossible , particularly by reducing state aid , which is systematically portrayed as being harmful
Unlike the rapporteur , we do not support ' the Commission 's continued commitment to reducing state aid still further '
We will therefore vote against his text , which is a mark of unreservedly rallying to the neo-liberal ideology
This has been expressly acknowledged in Article 299 of the Treaty of Amsterdam
An objective contribution to this conclusion is the verified reduction in the number of cases examined and , at the same time , the sharp rise in fines imposed
I also particularly welcome the rapporteur 's proposal to attach absolute priority to policies involving horizontal aid to help industry adjust to the Kyoto commitments
This is the way forward for a European economy that aspires to be increasingly ' more dynamic and competitive ' but also ecologically balanced
In recent years , the Commission has fulfilled its mission to hunt down state aid with a somewhat blind zeal , seeing aid to be criticised practically everywhere
We regret that it did not have that courage earlier , for example when the Commission condemned public aid for employment in the French textiles sector
We hope that this case law will be confirmed
the national democracies should also be able to have an input
The report by Philippe Herzog proposes some minor adjustments to the scoreboard for state aid and gives some pious wishes
Like him , we deplore the freezing of Research and Development aid , and like him , we are in favour of exceptional cases being considered
However , the report must be severely criticised in terms of its content
It deals with the absence of any evaluation procedure as just one point among many others
The reason why this aspect is only mentioned in passing is that the rapporteur deprived it of all importance in advance by swe@@ aring allegiance to the neo-liberal dogma
The dominant theme of this report is therefore detailed arrangements with a logic of pure competition , and this is also why we voted against it
In the framework of competition policy , the half-yearly publication of the scoreboard for State aid since 2001 is an important tool for transparency and debate
Within the EU , government aid is a dirty word these days
There is no room for it in the pursuit of unlimited international competition and tax reduction
However , a great deal of government aid is channelled to companies in a disguised form
In some cases , there is an over-capacity on offer for the transport of freight , as new motorways , goods railways and can@@ als are being built
Consequently , companies are free to choose which part of this infrastructure they can utilise while keeping their transport costs to a minimum
Many companies only managed to start up or survive thanks to government aid , and this is not likely to change a great deal in future
This applies all the more if services of general interest , public services in other words , are considered as part of the economy
Although those services are vital to the well-being of people and the conservation of our environment , they are , in many cases , running at a constant loss
Only nepotism , the giving of government funding to business connections , should be prevented
The right-wing elements in this House will do everything in their power to obstruct this process
Lastly , I disagree with the rapporteur 's call for the codecision procedure to be extended to this field
That concludes voting time
( The sitting was suspended at 1
and resumed at 3 p
I am told that Rule 120 did not apply , and also that the very Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament did not apply during that extraordinary debate
Mr Berthu , your remark does not pertain to the Minutes for yesterday
Nonetheless , it has been noted and a response will be provided when appropriate
Mr President , further to a statement by Mr Gorostiaga last Monday , I wish to make one point clear
Mr Gorostiaga referred to a report by the United Nations Committee Against Torture , and subsequently sent an e-mail to all Members of the House
A number of adjustments have been made to legislation in order to prevent torture
This is particularly true for those of us holding elected office
The most significant torture is actually that perpetrated by ETA terrorists as they murder , blackmail and kid@@ na@@ p
I myself am well aware of the situation , as I hold elected office in Spain
Nevertheless , your comments have been noted
I did not do this and I am also grateful to my fellow MEPs who were dissu@@ aded from fighting this battle
Why are we not facing the battle ?
The European Court of Justice has said several times that the coordination regulation should apply to these legally resident citizens as well
The Commission has submitted a directive , an amendment to a regulation , on this very subject
It chose to use a different legal basis but failed to get the Council to ratify it
I think that an institutional battle over what would have been the correct legal basis would have lasted for many years and would certainly not have benefited these people
The fact that the Danes and even the British felt they should be involved in this regulation filled me with particular joy
It will in any event also create clarity , which is desperately needed
I should like to extend to him , via yourself , my warmest wishes for a very speedy recovery
I am certain that I am also doing this on behalf of the fellow MEPs who are working on this dossier
It is therefore a major contribution to a balanced , coherent Community immigration policy
The proposal will also encourage worker mobility , the importance of which was illustrated by the Commission 's action plan presented at the start of the year
The proposal will therefore simplify the rules , reducing the number of national and international instruments which govern the coordination of social security systems for this category of people
It simply extends the scope of Community regulations on social security to third-country nationals , regulations which are and will continue to be based on Article 42 of the Treaty
This means that , for any future amendments to Regulation 1408/71 , Parliament will continue to be a co@@ decision-@@ maker
The Commission is therefore able to support Amendment No 1
The importance of coordinating social security systems for third-country nationals is already amply conveyed in the first nine recitals proposed by the Commission
While it agrees with the underlying concept , the Commission therefore cannot accept Amendment No 2
the Commission can therefore accept Amendment No 3
It is , however , unable to support Amendments Nos 4 and 5
The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 5 for a number of reasons
First of all , the aim of the proposal is to grant third-country nationals legally residing in a Member State the same rights as Community citizens moving within the Union
Amendment No 5 seeks to grant third-country nationals different rights to those given to Community citizens
Moreover , there is already a high degree of media interest in this proposal
We are aware that this mobility , which we talk about so much , is much more difficult to put into practice than free movement of property and goods
That is not an insignificant number
However , like the rapporteur , I would like to draw your attention to the issue of the legal basis chosen by the European Commission following pressure from the Council
The European Parliament had the consultation procedure imposed on it , whereas the first proposal in 1997 was based on Article 51 , now Article 42 , which assumes codecision
I fear that there is an underlying trend , and I think that our institution will have to be vigilant
We would not like to take responsibility for the failure of something that we desire
Mr President , on behalf of my group and on behalf of Jean Lambert , I want to warmly congratulate the rapporteur on her report
We fully support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten 's approach , including the way she handled the legal basis
I think it important that agreements reached by way of European coordination now also apply to third-country nationals
Parliament has already expressed its desire that the Tampere conclusions should be transposed into real action in a similar way as regards the rights of third-country nationals
My group hopes that the struggle that must still be engaged in will lead to the necessary consensus being reached in this House
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 5
The next item is the Commission statement on climate change
Mr President , thank you for inviting the Commission to report to this House on the New Delhi Conference on Climate Change held in October 2002
The Commission is also pleased to acknowledge the sound political support it received from the NGOs present at the meeting
That interest was reflected by your dedicated parliamentary delegation led by Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo in New Delhi
We hope to continue our effective cooperation in the future
They also debated the need for further action to continue the fight against climate change
The meeting ended with the adoption of the Delhi Declaration
Allow me to briefly outline the Commission 's political assessment of the New Delhi Conference
The Delhi Ministerial Declaration represents the political outcome of the conference
Let me briefly address some shortcomings
First , the Delhi Declaration fails to underline the need for a closer link between science and policy action
This must be used as an important input for furthering the work of the climate change convention and the Kyoto Protocol
A science@@ -based approach will give us more confidence in our policy scenarios for the future being on the right track
Such discussions should have started at the Conference of the Parties at its first session after the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol
Regrettably , the EU did not succeed in persuading other parties to recognise the need for starting such a process
However , through a number of bilateral contacts with other parties and groups of parties the EU did seize every opportunity to explain our way of thinking
The issue is now on the table and these discussions have provided a solid foundation on which we can build
A third but more general point is that the debate in Delhi tended to focus on sustainable development rather than on climate change
While there is a clear understanding in the EU that climate change is strongly linked to sustainable development , the UN framework convention on climate change is about just that
It is the framework for climate change which is well defined and in place
We should not allow the sustainable development discussion to distract us from the climate change process
Following this conference , what prospects can we see for the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol ?
This is obviously a crucial question
As you know this requires ratification by 55 parties representing at least 55 % of the CO2 emissions of the industrialised countries in 1990
The first threshold has been largely met - 97 countries as of 13 November - as ratification continues steadily
In this context , we gladly welcome the confirmation by Canada that they will soon ratify
However , we have only reached a figure of 37
Given that the EU , Japan and almost all the candidate countries have now ratified , this means that ratification by Russia is necessary to bring the Protocol into effect
It seems that Russia is still inclined to ratify , especially after the results of the recently published study on the effects of climate change in that country
However , a final decision has yet to be made and no specific timetable has been set out
Inter@@ nally , the Commission will proceed within the framework of the European Climate Change Programme to enable the European Union to meet its emissions reductions targets as agreed
Inter@@ nationally , on the other hand , the Commission will continue its efforts to encourage our partners to ratify the Kyoto Protocol so that it can enter into force
Everybody knows that the Kyoto Protocol is only the first step in the fight against climate change and we have to start to discuss how to proceed beyond it
I would like to conclude by stressing once again how deeply grateful the Commission is for the Parliament 's support and for its very dedicated presence in Delhi itself
We certainly missed her in New Delhi
I should like to make a few points regarding that conference
The European Union must continue to take the lead in the international fight against climate change
It must therefore promote political debate on objectives for beyond 2012 at the earliest opportunity
COP@@ 8 had seemed a good opportunity to consolidate decisions on implementation of the Kyoto Protocol taken earlier at Bonn and Marrakech
Unfortunately , the opportunity was missed
No broad debate was launched on the main issues for the second period
Significant progress on technical matters was made at the COP@@ 8 , however
These related in particular to mechanisms for clean development , reporting , and review procedures
On the other hand , progress on a political level was disappointing
As the Commissioner stated , attempts to water down the specific features of the Kyoto Protocol by means of the much broader concept of sustainable development won the day
In this connection it has to be said that the attitude of the United States delegation was not very constructive
It consistently avoided references to deadlines and specific objectives
The members of our delegation all agreed that ratification of the Protocol by States which have not yet done so must be speeded up
We had in mind Russia in particular
If Russia ratified the Protocol it would come into force
It is however worrying that Russia maintained a non-@@ committed attitude throughout the conference
Regarding the position of developing countries , concern over inadequate financial support from developed countries was expressed
Trans@@ fer of technology to facilitate the adoption of measures to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects was also deemed inadequate
Further , we feel we should consider the possibility of setting up an interparliamentary committee to deal with India in particular
India is home to a thousand million people
It has an emerging economy which is growing continuously and its Parliament has expressed a clear political will to cooperate with the European Parliament
Finally , I should emphasise that there was constructive cooperation with the Council and the Commission
The latter both recognised the essential role of delegations from Parliament in conferences of this sort
It is precisely for that reason that we believe it is not acceptable for our delegations to be excluded from coordination meetings
We therefore request that delegations from Parliament be admitted to these meetings in future , at least as observers
Mr President , I shall attempt the trick of representing two people here today - myself and Mrs Corbey , who was present at the New Delhi conference
That does not mean that I shall convey two different messages
Instead , I shall try to make the message as stringent as possible
Having read the Commission 's and Parliament 's report on the New Delhi conference , there is a question that keeps going round in my head
Why is the United States more successful in doing so ?
The United States 's message is , at least in our eyes , worse in terms of combating the climate change that is under way
That also applies to the possibility of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol
These all no doubt constitute the most important aspects of our continued strategy for trying to progress further
It is , above all , a question of making further progress with the important work that will now commence when this part of the Kyoto Protocol has been concluded
Mrs Corbey , who was present at the New Delhi conference , made some notes that I think are worth communicating to the House
They are , above all , about the Kyoto process in actual fact constituting a serious political danger because political support for the whole process is evapor@@ ating
There are two essential aspects to trying to increase political support again and to raising the issue for discussion at a more subtle and serious level
One factor , for example , is the one I have just addressed , namely the situation in the developing countries and our relations with those countries
At the New Delhi conference , quite a few of them reported extreme weather conditions
It was not just one country but a number that did so , and they also expressed opinions as to what costs the situation would entail
We must adopt a clearer role in helping the developing countries to protect themselves against climate change
That is perhaps the most important message to have come out of the New Delhi conference
I am sorry that once again the Commission and the Council did not allow Parliament 's delegation to participate in the EU coordination meetings
What I believe to be more serious is not so much the failure to reach an outcome but rather the political attempt to water down the Kyoto Protocol
It is also a pity that the developing countries have fallen into this trap
It is precisely in the developing countries that the consequences of climate change are having the most damaging effects
firstly , the Kyoto Protocol is the only instrument capable of mitigating climate change
Secondly , the second phase of the Protocol must be set even more ambitious targets than the first phase , which represents only a tiny step forwards
Thirdly , action must first be undertaken in the industrialised countries and only later in the developing countries
Mr President , this was the first time I had taken part in one of these delegations
I concur with what colleagues have said and also express my frustration with the exclusion of the parliamentary delegation from the daily coordination meetings
As a result , the Commission ended the last day trying to exclude us from the press conference , albeit very politely and diplomatically
When we parliamentarians were briefed that morning , we indicated our frustration with the weakness of the draft declaration
The Commission did not want us to express that view at a press conference when it was taking what it thought was a more diplomatic line
These differences would not arise if we were part of the coordination meeting and on the inside
The Council and the Commission were on one side and Parliament on the other
The draft declaration itself was rather weak and disappointing
The title was changed from ' The Declaration on Climate Change ' to ' Declaration on Climate Change and Sustainability '
That is a precedent we have to be careful of
It is very hard to talk about these issues , be objective and keep the focus on climate change if it is suggested that sustainable development is not included
It is a sort of ' h@@ it-@@ me-@@ with@@ -@@ a-@@ child-@@ in-@@ m@@ y-@@ arms ' argument , i
The Americans and others used the serious issue of sustainable development to divert focus from climate change and from the Kyoto Protocol requirements in general
It was a fascinating exercise
I would like to thank the leader of our delegation , Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo , and all colleagues for making it that
the most striking example is the Kyoto Agreement
We should work much harder in this respect , and I trust the Commission will do so
The debate is closed
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this debate ought never to have been necessary
Sadly , the Commission has today been proved right
The Commission proposed the speedy withdrawal of old-fashioned single-hull tankers some time ago
Unfortunately the Council did not follow our advice
It failed to act with the necessary urgency and adopt the Commission 's proposals following discussion with Parliament
Had it done so , the Prestige would have been banned since 1 September 2002
It would therefore never have broken up and sunk off the coast of Europe
There are lessons to be learnt from all this
Those were my very words when the Erika sank off the coast of Brittany
I must reiterate them today , as we discuss the case of the Prestige which sunk off Spain , off the coast of Galicia to be precise
There are lessons to be learnt and measures to be taken
The first lesson is crystal clear
Speed is of the essence , and so are determination and decisive action
These situations need to be dealt with once and for all , to ensure no further similar tragedies happen
The immediate action required is obvious
The authorities must compensate those affected and they must undertake the clean-up operation required to return the coast to its previous condition
I will remind the House that this is a particularly rich coast , both in terms of fish and shellfish production and from an environmental point of view
Almost all of it is covered by Natura 2002
So , the affected areas need to be cleaned and restored
The chain of events leading to the disaster must also be traced
It should be borne in mind that back in 1997 a number of oil companies rejected this vessel , on the grounds that it was dangerous and unsafe
It appears that the last time the vessel under@@ went an inspection as required in the European Union under the Paris M@@ em@@ orandum was in 1999
Furthermore , the vessel had put into two European ports before this summer
It is important to study all the links in the chain and establish what exactly happened and where responsibility lies
The lessons to be learnt to prevent a repeat of such situations should then become clear
It has links with other countries too , all of which offer substantial tax advantages
We are called on to take all the urgent action in our power to prevent a further tragedy of this kind
That involves the immediate application and implementation of agreements and directives adopted by European Union Ministers
Applic@@ ation of the Erika I package cannot wait until June of next year , nor can the Erika II package be left until February of 2004
They must be put into practice now
The standards specified in existing provisions must be applied
Sing@@ le-@@ hull tankers must be replaced by double-hull ones as a matter of urgency
The Community system for following up information on maritime traffic in all areas must be set up at the earliest opportunity
Steps should also be taken to facilitate emergency intervention , by design@@ ating protection areas , mooring areas and areas for emergency shelter
The European Maritime Safety Agency should start operations too
It is tasked with ensuring that the correct procedures are followed in all European ports , and also with providing technical support to the various countries and to the Commission
Discussions with the COPE Fund ought to be pursued
This fund was set up for the specific purpose of covering compensation and the cost of restoring and cleaning the environment
This is over and above standard compensation
It complements the F@@ IP@@ OL Fund
Heav@@ y fuel oil is after all the most polluting of all these products
Each of the vessels involved in the latest three accidents , namely the Erika , the Baltic and the Prestige , was an old-fashioned single-hull tanker carrying heavy fuel oil
Heav@@ y fuel oil is the most dangerous product
Consequently , stricter safety measures are needed
This could easily be achieved through an administrative decision by the governments of the Member States
That means working to increase the F@@ IP@@ OL and COPE Funds
It also means per@@ sever@@ ing with the Commission 's work on future criminal sanctions in the European area
Going further also means that port authorities should improve the application of the directive on inspection
It has been shown that there are ports where hardly any inspection takes place
These could almost be termed ports of convenience
This amounts to taking fraudulent advantage of the present situation and has to be stopped
In addition , going further means reconsidering the basis of international maritime law at global level within the framework of the International Maritime Organisation
A century and a half ago this just did not happen
Going further also means strengthening the rights of coastal states in the 200@@ -@@ mile zone , and in straits
In particular , these rights need to be strengthened so that they can be defended against the risks of those particularly dangerous car@@ goes
Ladies and gentlemen , going further should also mean talking to our neighbours
I have in mind those who share with us a common interest in certain enormously fragile seas
We should cooperate with Russia and with other states in Europe , the Middle East and North Africa
In conclusion , I would like to emphasise that the Prestige disaster need never have happened
As a Commission , we did everything in our power to prevent it
We were unsuccessful , but we must ensure no second Erika or second Prestige founders off our coasts
We must also strive to ensure that such incidents do not occur along the coasts of other seas , off other continents
We should remember that the seas are a common heritage , and that our concern has to extend to their far@@ thest reaches
Mr President , Commissioner , honourable Members , as a native of Galicia I feel devastated
I am quite overcome by the spectacle unfolding before us
As a politician , I am keenly aware of the heavy responsibility we bear as Members of this House
We are charged with defending the interests of our constituents and we must succeed in so doing
V@@ ague statements and half-@@ truths simply will not do any longer
As the Commissioner said , this has to be the last tragedy at sea
I should indeed like to begin by commending Commissioner de Palacio on her work
To all intents and purposes , before she was appointed there was no such thing as a European policy on maritime safety
We now have a substantial package of measures on the table , namely Erika I and Erika II
The question as to whether these measures are adequate and whether they are being applied correctly has already been raised in the House
Clearly , the answer is no
The European Parliament must unite and throw its political weight behind the European Commission
It has to send out a clear signal
We need to work together to speed up implementation of these measures
They must come into force
The Commissioner referred to double hulls
The latter are compulsory in the United States , and had that been the case here , this accident probably would not have happened
The Commissioner also mentioned inspections at ports within the European Community , which is where we should start , and at all other ports in Europe and across the world
All ports should actually be monitored , be they colonies , tax havens or ports of convenience as some have been described
The Maritime Safety Agency has to start operating as soon as possible
Sadly , as a native of Galicia I am all too aware of the unfortunate record held by that part of Spain
Eight such accidents have taken place there over the last thirty years
Six of these accidents happened in the last twenty years
In Galicia the Atlantic coast of the Cape Fin@@ is@@ ter@@ re area is known as the Coast of Death
The European Agency should be located in an area affected by maritime accidents
It should be in one that has experienced their consequences
Perhaps others could offer more than my region
Loc@@ ating the Agency in Galicia could however go some way towards compensating the area
I know this falls outside the competence of both Parliament and the Commission , but I feel moved to express my thoughts al@@ oud
In any case , the resolution calls for the establishment of special maritime fishing areas
Undoubtedly , Galicia does fall into that category because of its rich shellfish and fishing resources mentioned earlier , and also because of its diversity and marine ecosystem
We are eager to move what could be termed the lanes of death further away from where they now are
We want to prevent our sea from becoming a se@@ wer
We want to prevent vessels that are no better than ru@@ sting hul@@ ks from sailing on it
The sea is Galicia 's life
Galicia 's economy is based on it and I could go so far as to say that its distinctive culture is too
Unfortunately , ladies and gentlemen , that sea is now poisoned
These measures must be strictly implemented as from tomorrow
We must insist that Member States do so
Mr President , I really feel the time has come for European solidarity to make itself felt
I would recall that we have ourselves shown solidarity to other Member States in the past
We now call on them to respond in kind
Any assistance offered to Galicia will be welcome
I would like to refer in particular to the Solidarity Fund
I studied Article 2 and it certainly does apply in this instance , especially if the reports approved by the House are borne in mind
It should also be taken into account that Galicia is an Objective 1 region whose fish and shellfish resources represent more than 10 % of its gross domestic product
Given that these are in danger of being totally wiped out for an unspecified period , Galicia does indeed meet the conditions for benefiting from the Solidarity Fund
In conclusion , I should like to assure the Commissioner that she can count on support from the Group of the European People 's Party
Indeed I am sure the whole House will support her in her efforts
We need to be able to start doing what is required as of tomorrow
Then we shall never again have to regret accidents of this kind
Thank you in advance , ladies and gentlemen , for the support I am confident you will offer us
Mr President , I should first like to thank the Commissioner for her presence in the House today
It is evidence of the great interest I know she has in this issue which is causing such concern to us all
The Prestige was carrying twice as much crude oil in its tanks as the Erika
The oil slick it caused is already an economic , social and environmental disaster for Europe , especially for my home region
It represents a mayor problem for Europe and its consequences will be felt for many long years
More than 300 km of coastline have been polluted
Three further spills have been detected and the strong wind from the south-west is bringing them closer to the coast
Shel@@ l@@ fish production , inshore fishing , aquaculture , tourism and the very image of Galicia have all been seriously affected
No effective lessons seem to have been learnt , even after enduring five oil spills
Sadly , it also has to be said that lack of equipment is currently hampering the efforts of many citizens eager to help
Pic@@ tures of hundreds of fishermen se@@ wing together an enormous net four kilometres long to create an amateur device for holding back the oil speak volumes
So do pictures of people on beaches armed with bu@@ c@@ kets and sp@@ ades
They show twenty-first century citizens coping with a nineteenth century disaster using St@@ one A@@ ge tools
Information has failed too
Spanish public opinion believes attempts were made to play down the gravity of the situation
This is in stark contrast to the grave concern expressed by European governments
The Commissioner rightly said that the disaster could have been prevented if European regulations had been applied
In addition , she stated that the Erika package will come into force in 2003
Those that do have such protection will be permitted up to 20@@ 26
Furthermore , the requirement for double hulls does not apply to small tankers , so they will still be able to sail also
That is why I am delighted with the Commissioner 's swift response
I welcome it and urge Member States in the Council to accept her proposals as a matter of urgency
Nonetheless , further action is needed
It is certainly true that this issue calls for legislation at world level , but the European Union has to press ahead
The Socialist Group calls for a policy on transport and sustainable development based on the principle of maximum safety and prevention
Such a policy must reinforce cooperation within the Community , along with the means of inspection and safety standards
We reiterate the call for Community funds to be channelled to this disaster
Community aid must retain its credibility , however
You will recall that Galicia was recently let down when no Community agreement was reached with Morocco
The victims ' interests must come first
This was clearly not the case here
I have to say , I am shocked and I should like to ask my fellow MEPs from that region to extend the sympathy of our group to everyone involved
We do not yet have all the facts by a long way , but we have a few
The question I am asking is whether the Erika package is sufficient
The Erika package is clearly valuable and should enter into force at the earliest opportunity , but is it sufficient ?
I have a question concerning airports
I mentioned airports and safe ber@@ thing places in one of my previous reports
I do not think that this legislation is completely incontrovertible
No provision has been made for this
In fact , a start is only just being made
Secondly , as you have already stated , Commissioner , we are very weak internationally speaking
Should we not reconsider all our options and use our influence to enhance the IMO 's role in the process ?
This is also a task for the Council; we cannot do this on our own
We therefore need to improve our rules
However , we should , first and foremost , help the people involved and alleviate the despair in that region
I believe this to be the duty of the European Union
Mr President , Commissioner , my mother tongue is very rich in popular pro@@ ver@@ bs and sa@@ y@@ ings
One of those sa@@ y@@ ings , which my mother and my grand@@ mothers would use when some irreversible domestic accident happened , was ' why cry over sp@@ ilt milk ? '
We must demand compliance with the laws we adopt , but also revise those which are not sufficiently rigorous
The Prestige disaster is now the fourth to have occurred off the coast of Galicia in recent years
On the Coast of Death and in the Ri@@ as B@@ ai@@ xas and the Ri@@ as Al@@ tas , these mis@@ fortunes are remembered even more sharply
As a Galician and a supporter of European integration , I wonder , what major action have the Galician and EU authorities taken in this tragic situation ?
Mr President , the location of the European Safe Seas Agency has still not been decided on , in contravention of the ' Erika ' legislation
Once again , the governments of the Member States have not been equal to the circumstances
Above all , however , we must go along with the positions of Commissioner de Palacio
Parliament and the Council must prove themselves able to provide what these communities are calling for
We voted on two blocks of measures
As a lawyer , before joining Parliament , I spent hundreds of hours with the victims of the Erika , professionals and local groups
So we need to find out who of all these was or was not to blame and we must , of necessity , be level-@@ headed and persistent
I think that we will get to the bottom of this in the end and the European Commission will be a great help here
We obviously need a set of measures
I have been talking with a number of Members over recent days who are all in favour of double hulls
Others want port controls , others are talking about the responsibility of the shipping registers and flags of convenience , others still point to the lack of ports of refuge
I think that those of us who happen to deal with these issues on a daily basis know that there is no universal panacea
There is no panacea , ladies and gentlemen , we need a set of measures , we need to proceed on all these fronts at once
Countries which do not comply with Community legislation should be ha@@ uled before the Court of Justice and I think Mrs Palacio will do so
Secondly , we really must speed up the application of the Erika I and Erika II packages
Now all that remains is to see if it is being applied in practice
We also need to push ahead with the European Commission 's other proposal on a European Solidarity Fund
May I remind you that the European Parliament approved these proposals by the European Commission and that the proposal has stuck with the Council
So pressure needs to be brought to bear on the Council
I totally agree with a ban on the carriage of heavy petroleum products by single-hull tankers
May I remind you that , as rapporteur , I personally proposed this when we were discussing withdrawing single-hull vessels
I believed it was feasible then and I believe it is feasible now and that you should move in this direction , Commissioner
What Mr Sterckx said about environmentally sensitive areas is also right
We need to mark out corridors for tankers so as to ensure that these areas are not polluted
Most importantly at this stage the European Union needs to show its solidarity with the people of Galicia
We need to help these people
We have the Structural Funds , we have the Solidarity Fund and we need to do our very best to help Galicia get back to normal as quickly as possible
Mr President , the ' Prestige ' tanker disaster is an appalling tragedy
We must show solidarity here , and - as our Portuguese and Spanish colleagues should know - it must be tangible rather than abstract
That is why the region and the people there need assistance from Europe quickly
I do not think that anyone would question this
We should be aware , however , that this disaster could be repeated any day , Commissioner , because for years it has been the same old story
The combination of an ancient tanker that is only fit for the scrap heap and a flag of convenience - this time of the Ba@@ ham@@ as - is usually the cause
Fl@@ ags of convenience are synonymous with poor quality , a poor vessel , poor technology and a poor crew
Usually the story ends with a coordinated reluctance to claim responsibility so that no one knows any more who is actually to blame for what
That , Commissioner , is the reason for Paragraph 3 of our motion
I think that a few words will also have to be reserved for the Spanish authorities in this context
I have been surprised at some of the statements made by ministers of transport over the last few days and at the demands that they are now making
Commissioner , you have Parliament 's full support if you want to put a bomb under these gentlemen in the Council so that we finally get legislation soon
Where incidents of this kind are concerned , we have to call to account the oil companies , the shipowners , the cargo owners and the classification societies
The system of flags of convenience cannot continue in its present form , Commissioner
I appeal to you to consider making a proposal on this
We need European ship@@ p@@ ing; we need good European vessels with good European crews
Fl@@ ags of convenience are a blight on the system
Help to eradicate them by making a good Commission proposal
Parliament will give it speedy consideration
Mr President , I as an EU citizen feel greatly affected by the fact that it was possible for this disaster to take place
This is yet another disaster , although we said after the last one that it was too late to lock the stable door after the horse had bolted
The stable door had clearly not been locked
The facts had not been sufficiently spelled out , something for which the politicians are at fault
I agree with Mrs de Palacio when she states that the Council has failed to assume its responsibility
It is particularly unfortunate that we need another disaster to put this topic on the agenda
I also think that we should adopt this resolution and that we all need to ensure that it is accepted across the political spectrum so as to avoid another repeat
After all , citizens are not concerned with which political body is responsible for this
They are left to pick up the pieces , so they need help
I see that the first towed hop@@ per dre@@ dges are now at work
However , according to the weather forecast , the winds will pick up this evening and then we are back to square one tomorrow
In short , I hope that , given this thick crude oil , you will also ensure that oil can possibly be drained from the actual tanker
First of all , I should like to put on record my and our solidarity with the people in Galicia
This is a social tragedy for those who live by the sea and tourism
The true scale of this economic and ecological disaster is starting to dawn ever more clearly
A true catastrophe is unfolding before our eyes
Galicia 's green coast is gradually turning black
The indignation is growing by the hour
Everyone is asking how this is possible after all those previous disasters
The disaster involving the Erika is still fresh in our memories and the wreck of the A@@ moco Cad@@ iz in 197@@ 8 awakened an environmental awareness in many of my generation
Every time a disaster strikes , we are faced with the disastrous consequences of negligence
It is a disgrace that the agency for maritime safety is not to be launched until some time next year
It is a disgrace that port control should only be scant and , in many cases , implemented in a questionable manner
It is a disgrace that single-hulled wrecks should still be b@@ ob@@ bing their way around the oceans and that they should take their course past vulnerable regions
There is something fundamentally wrong with our transport sector
There are therefore bad ap@@ ples that need to be removed
They are sharks that slip through the net
However , we should admit that the net that is supposed to catch them is yet to be put in place
We as Greens support more transport by water , but those highways at sea should not be accessible to cow@@ boys and environmental criminals
We would argue in favour of less transport , less use of fossil fuels and more involvement by a greater , fully-fledged , ecological European Union
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to begin , of course , by expressing my solidarity with the communities that have been affected
In this matter , the ' polluter pays ' rule must be enforced , by investigating , prosecuting and punishing those responsible
We must , however , go beyond looking for someone to blame
We must determine the responsibility , firstly of those who should have inspected but did not and of those who did inspect but did not act
So where is the problem ?
I think that it was stated by Mr Var@@ aut
My government , in recent days , was upset that measures had not yet entered into force@@ ; France is lagging behind in terms of checks in ports
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there is very little ' prestige ' here , quite the contrary
It is clear that we must be increasingly demanding in terms of safety in transport , especially in the transport of dangerous goods and at sea
It begs the question , how many more oil tankers do we have to endure ?
Has account been taken of the negative impact of this ecological disaster on fishing , on nature , on tourism , on the society in this Galicia Fin@@ is@@ ter@@ re ?
It depends on us , but we must speed up and review the measures adopted in the Erika case - as the Commissioner has just rightly pointed out
Finally , I would like once again to express our solidarity with the Galic@@ ians and I hope the European Union demonstrates that same solidarity through its actions
Mr President , Commissioner , the feelings that we have in the face of this tragedy are feelings of anger
An@@ ger at its tragic consequences , and also anger because we have had enough of Europe being accused
If we had followed the Commission , if we had followed the European Parliament , we would not be in this position
We have had enough of being accused for no reason when we have adequate legislation and there is no further need to legislate
The legislation needs to be applied and that is the problem
If the situation was not so tragic , one could laugh at it
You know the result
France was criticised by the European Commission for not respecting the directive on checks in ports
We have had enough of the failings of the Member States and the Council
I hope that no coastal Member State will fail to answer that call
We have the legislation , which is adequate , with the ' Erika II ' package
We need to increase checks , ensure the integrity of those who carry out those checks and define which ports should be able to receive vessels in distress
We should also express our complete solidarity with the people of Galicia , who are going to suffer terribly in terms of fishing and tourism
Having said that , the environmental tragedy is even worse , as it cannot be repaired by just giving subsidies
What is the use of ' Natura 2000 ' and our protection directives if we do nothing about maritime security ?
Today the Council is responsible for having blocked the legislation that we adopted
Today , it is the people of the coastal States , European citizens , who are asking you , Commissioner , to be uncompromising
Mr President , this is without doubt a global disaster affecting all European coastlines and Europe must pool all its resources to combat it
That is why I am dismayed by the reports that the Commissioner is suggesting Gibraltar was in some way responsible because it failed to inspect the ship
In that period it has also put in at several other ports , including Al@@ g@@ ec@@ iras , L@@ as Pal@@ mas , Dun@@ k@@ ir@@ k , Cork , Rotterdam and Kal@@ am@@ ata
if you live in a gl@@ as@@ sh@@ ouse you do not have sex with your gar@@ den@@ er
After the Bra@@ er sank off the coast of Scotland in 1992 , Neil Kinnock put forward legislation on double-hull vessels
As the Commissioner rightly pointed out , that was deferred by the Council until 2015
However , we need new legislation now to close up the loopholes
Despite the fact that history repeats itself , it is still difficult to establish data on the origin and destination of the cargo , as well as its exact characteristics
We must also urgently consider bringing forward the obligatory demand for double hulls and intensify and improve the quality of inspections
This has been said very clearly by Commissioner de Palacio
But above all it is essential that the existing rules are applied
Neither must we forget the human face of this disaster and the importance of the aid reaching its destination as soon as possible
Yesterday I was in Galicia , where the des@@ olation of the fishermen is truly striking
How many more disasters do we need before effective measures are adopted ?
Ex@@ pressing moral solidarity and demonstrating sympathy are not enough; we must act as rapidly as possible and , as I said , adopt emergency measures
I would like to say that I fully agree with the Commissioner 's words and support those measures which offer a clear line of action
We also share her desire for their application to be speeded up
This is what is needed , and what we do not need is any more political demagoguery such as that expressed in some speeches we have heard here
I believe that enough has been said and that we must look forward , learning from the lessons of the immediate past
The Galician Government has said that it is not going to impose any limits on the aid to the people affected
The Spanish Government and the European Commission is announcing measures
We will all be grateful for the measures taken , especially those who live , work and suffer along our coasts
We must take the opportunity of the Prestige oil tanker disaster to make a few observations
The fisheries sector , as a matter of fact , has already begun to be affected
I do not think that the EUR 117
Furthermore , we will have to bear in mind that compensation for the prolonged suspension of fishing alone will not suffice
Unfortunately , this practice still does not apply to the applicant countries , and this ship had picked up its cargo at a port in the Baltic Sea
Obviously , making ports responsible for the condition of vessels to be loaded is not enough
The owners of freight must also be made accountable , as they also have an interest in ensuring that their consignments are organised responsibly and safely
Insurance law must be based on the notion that rescuing the ship must be possible and the cheapest option for the policy@@ holder
We have to switch to these practices swiftly and without making any exceptions
It is regrettable that the legislators should become wise and energetic only after an accident has happened
When , however , the accident has f@@ aded in people 's memories no wise or urgent measures are taken to avoid accidents in the future
We need a Prestige package as an extension to the Erika package , which the Commission should start drafting right away with a view to producing something quickly
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to reply to Mr Miller , because I believe he has the wrong information
I have here for your perusal the precise movements of the Prestige during 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 , provided by the maritime authority of the Ba@@ ham@@ as
It then reached the port of Gibraltar and I have also approached the British authorities to ask why they did not carry out the control
It is true , ladies and gentlemen , that I have not just asked them about the Prestige
I have asked about controls and the application in these ports - Kal@@ am@@ ata and Gibraltar - of the Directive currently in force
I must tell the honourable Member that I have some statistics
I can say that in Gibraltar , in 1999 , five ships have been inspected
Those are the statistics
Because controls by port authorities have a deterrent effect , they have the effect of keeping away sub@@ standard ships , and this must happen in all ports
Because if we leave gaps in our network , in our system , the whole thing is automatically weakened
This is not a criticism of any particular port
And I have asked for information
But the problem is not with any particular port
And I am talking about the fact , ladies and gentlemen , that only 23 months have passed
And precisely because only 23 months have passed and because there was a lack of ambition - as we all know - there has been another disaster
Well , that is my point
Ladies and gentlemen , what we have to demand - and this is what I have done in a letter to the Ministers - is that they be applied now
The problem is that the Governments are behaving in@@ coherently
The Heads of State and Government said in Nice that the implementation of these measures had to be brought forward and then they do not apply them
Our proposal meant that single-hull oil tankers , of category 1 , that is , the largest ones , would have a maximum life of 23 years
Because there is clearly a problem with structures associated with the stress on metals caused by blows at sea , which arise after twenty or so years
And what I regret is that this proposal of ours should not be accepted and that it be raised from 23 to 27 years
And that is what the current problems stem from
There will be the aid provided by the Spanish authorities
What we clearly have are the F@@ IP@@ OL funds
We are also looking at issues relating to fishing to see what possibilities there may be for support in terms of the FIFG funds
We are looking at the possibility of applying the Solidarity Fund , but I believe it will not be possible - I say this clearly
We would be talking about more than EUR 3 000 million , ladies and gentlemen
I hope that Portugal can be spared from this tragedy
I hope that the winds will not allow the oil slick to reach their coast
I would like the Spanish coasts not be to be affected any further , but let us hope , at least , that the Portuguese coasts stay clean
Ladies and gentlemen , what has been adopted must be put into practice
We are going to set up this Maritime Safety Agency provisionally in Brussels , while they are deciding or not deciding on where the headquarters will be
I am very sorry , but I am not going to wait for them to come to an agreement
I hope it will be set up before the end of the year
All of this within the context of the International Maritime Organisation , genuinely adapting maritime law to the demands and new circumstances of the 21st Century
Mr Savary spoke of an autonomous European area of maritime safety
The truth is that this is an issue which , of course , could be considered in the discussions within the Convention and the next Intergovernmental Conference
I am sure you can imagine that it will not be I who disagrees with these ideas
Commissioner , Mrs Miguélez Ramos would like to ask you a further supplementary question
Mr President , I only wanted to ask the Commissioner a very brief question
This does not mean that when the Erika accident happened - which was off the French coast - I acted any differently
I went to Brittany then and tomorrow I am going to Galicia
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 5
The next item is the debate on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law
Mr President , this debate on Sudan has had a successful outcome even before it has begun
The invitation to the EU/@@ ACP Assembly has , in the meantime , been withdrawn
It is detrimental to cooperation in the spirit of Cotonou that the proposal of Sudan was adopted by the ACP states
Did these states really think that we could hold an Assembly in a country where there are still constant and large-scale breaches of human rights ?
In a country in which women and children are kidnapped and en@@ sla@@ ved ?
There now , fortunately , appears to be a tru@@ ce , but how long will it hold ?
Civil war has been raging there for 19 years
More than two million people have lost their lives because of this war
It has brought immense suffering for the people in the south of Sudan who are fighting for cultural , political and economic independence
In the larger part of Sudan that is under government control there is no freedom of thought or religion and no possibility of peaceful assembly
Human rights continue to be treated with contempt
Government forces are blan@@ ke@@ t-@@ bombing regions in the south with heavy civilian casualties
More than 200 death sentences have been passed by unconstitutional emergency courts in D@@ ar@@ fur State
The oil discoveries in Sudan have not yet led to a return to peace
On the contrary , they serve to replen@@ ish the war chest of the K@@ har@@ tou@@ m government
the peace talks in Mac@@ ha@@ k@@ os in Kenya , which have led to the conclusion of a ceasefire agreement
This has been drafted , but is not yet in force
First , unimpeded access must be provided for aid consignments for the people starving in the south of Sudan
This must also lead to a permanent ceasefire on both sides , which is respected by everyone
In any case , we will not go there while the current situation persists
We do hope , however , that this will be possible at a later stage
I should like to stress that Sudan 's Ambassador here is doing a great deal through diplomatic channels to hasten a return to peace
We therefore call on the African countries to organise the next ACP-EU Assembly in another , more peaceful country in Africa
Mauritania , which wishes to take on this task , should be specifically encouraged to do so
Mr President , the emergency in Sudan has become very acute
We only need to consider the title of the recent report by the International Crisis Group , ' En@@ ding starvation as a weapon of war in Sudan '
Indeed , famine and death from starvation on a huge scale are being used as weapons of war in Sudan
In the meantime , the warring parties appear to have concluded an agreement to extend the memorandum of understanding on humanitarian aid and the suspension of hostilities to 31 March
Despite this courageous development , the decision indicates that the final peace settlement has not yet been achieved
Fundamental bones of contention such as the fair distribution of power and of the income from oil wells still need to be solved in ways acceptable to both parties
It is estimated that approximately two million people have already lost their lives
Tw@@ ice as many people have been made homeless , and countless atrocities have been committed
In particular , the Christians in the south have had to suffer severely from violence committed by the Muslims in the north
I would therefore call upon the Council and the Commission to proceed extremely cautiously during the EU Troika mission to Sudan , planned for 9 and 10 December
Only when a comprehensive peace settlement has been signed may relations between the EU and Sudan be norm@@ alised
Mr President , we have to bear in mind that the situation in Sudan varies greatly depending on the region
In the north we are dealing with a problematic regime , which is however displaying clear reformist tendencies , and which is supported by Egypt
In the south we have a brutal and bloody civil war , which it would be too simplistic to describe solely as a conflict between Islam and Christianity
There are also conflicts amongst Muslims themselves and amongst Christian tribes , although the main conflict is indeed between Christians and Muslims
The path we choose should be to support the cause of the forces in the south and the north that are calling for a secular state and democratic institutions
The solution cannot and must not be that of world division on the basis of religious beliefs
Mr President , I may not look like Mr Schulz but I am deputising for him
The Socialist Group is deeply concerned by the continuing civil war that has claimed around two million casualties over the last 19 years
Of course we welcome the signing on 15 October of the peace agreement between the government in Sudan and the SP@@ LA
We ask the Commission to provide us with a report on the possible involvement of European oil companies in abuses committed against local communities in the oil - producing areas
We certainly do not support the idea that the ACP-EU Parliamentary assembly should meet in Sudan next year
It may be possible in the future but we will have to see how things develop in Sudan
The current conflict and the ongoing violations of human rights are the main obstacle to the socio-economic development of the country , as several speakers have rightly pointed out
The Commission firmly believes that respect for human rights would enable peace to return to Sudan
In accordance with the conclusions adopted by the Council in June 2002 , the Union intends to proceed step by step
At the same time , it will encourage the peace process and resolution of the conflicts
I would , however , like to emphasise that the implementation of the measures laid down in the national strategy document is subject to progress in political dialogue
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at 5
Ac@@ ts of violence have afflicted Bangladesh ever since that country was founded
From the beginning , the political system has been undermined by murder , revenge and rivalry between the most important families
The spiral of ceas@@ eless revenge has not been broken
On the contrary , the situation is going from bad to worse , in particular through the alarming growth of radical Islamic groups
The government 's approach is , unfortunately , not aimed at reducing the tension and solving the problems
Members of Parliament are put in prison
Large-scale indiscriminate arrests take place , and people are tortured and even murdered in prisons
The European Union must actively concern itself with the situation in Bangladesh on the basis of the cooperation agreement we have with that country
Cooperation cannot continue unconditionally if human rights are being violated on a huge scale
We must insist that a national human rights commission be set up to carry out independent examinations , and immunity from punishment must be brought to an end
The police and military must prevent and combat violence instead of fuelling it
What is crucial to a solution is to restore a minimum basis of trust between government and opposition
The future must not forever remain the hostage of the past
Nothing will come of the development of this impoverished country if it is possible for the acts of violence to continue unabated
Mr President , in the past few weeks the escalating violence in Bangladesh has reached new heights
In October alone , around 40 000 soldiers were deployed in ' Operation Clean H@@ ear@@ t ' on the pretext of fighting rising levels of crime and private gun ownership
Several thousand people were arrested
We know from reliable , independent sources that this military operation , ordered by the Islamist Government in Bangladesh , was directed primarily at the regime 's critics
Among those arrested were opposition members of the Banglad@@ es@@ hi Parliament , including the former minister , Mr Ch@@ ow@@ d@@ hur@@ y
Leaders of unpopular NGOs were also arrested
The army units carried them off without any legal authority
Most of the suspects are either Hind@@ us themselves or Hindu sympath@@ isers
This minority has however lived peacefully alongside the Muslim majority for decades
The growing , and radical , Islam@@ ic@@ isation of society and its political leaders is making everyday life increasingly difficult
Those in custody are cut off from the outside world
Hundreds of injured detainees had to receive hospital treatment
In the last month alone there were 25 deaths
The army 's claim that they had all died of heart attacks is cynical
This action is cont@@ emp@@ tuous of humankind and in violation of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights
we call on the Banglad@@ es@@ hi Government to return to the rule of law , pluralism and parliamentary democracy
The imprisoned members of parliament and other innocent detainees must be released
an independent body needs to be set up to investigate the arrests , ill-treatment and killings
Only then will Bangladesh be able to recover the necessary internal stability
The European Union must also make its contribution , Commissioner Monti
The agreement between the European Union and Bangladesh is based on consistent respect for human rights and on democratic principles
Should these continue to be violated to the same degree then we will have to bring political pressure to bear and that means suspending our Cooperation Agreement
Such important signals are easily understood throughout Asia as well as in other countries
We in the SAARC Delegation can give many examples to confirm this
Only then will our respectable counterparts in Bangladesh be taken seriously at international level
Mr President , on 17 October this year 40 000 members of the armed forces launched Operation Clean H@@ ear@@ t in Bangladesh
It resulted in house@@ -to-@@ house raids and sear@@ ches aimed specifically at the A@@ w@@ ami League 's voters , party workers , the Hindu community and members of opposition political parties
Thousands were arrested and held in in@@ communic@@ ado detention
25 people are alleged to have died after being tortured while in detention
The claim that these deaths were the results of heart attacks is frankly incredible
Mr President , Commissioner , the Italian Radical Members fully support the resolution that has been tabled
Last January , when answering a parliamentary question , Commissioner Patten said that the situation in Bangladesh was improving and that the Commission would undertake to monitor it
The EU consequently welcomes the European Parliament 's resolution on Operation Clean H@@ ear@@ t and the general human rights situation in Bangladesh
However , there are a couple of points in the resolution which we believe no longer reflect the current situation or are not substantiated by evidence on the ground
We should send a clear message calling on the government to ensure that the rights and security of all minority communities are fully respected
The government launched the operation as a result of this pressure and the failure to deal with the situation by introducing new laws and tightening up on the existing ones
Under no circumstances can exceptions to these principles be allowed
That is why the European Commission , through its delegation in D@@ ha@@ ka , will continue to monitor the situation and the political developments very closely
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 5
Mr President , even if Doctor H@@ ac@@ hem Ag@@ ha@@ jar@@ i does not receive the death penalty , Iran nonetheless remains condemned to domination by its ultra-@@ conservative religious leaders
The success of the student demonstrations cannot conceal the fact that the human rights situation has not improved but has , in fact , deteriorated
The stoning of women , public hanging , torture and other barbaric practices mean that Iran still does not fulfil the elementary demands of civilisation
It is therefore astonishing that the European Union has not tabled a resolution concerning the situation in Iran in the UN General Assembly Third Committee
Many Member States say that they have high expectations of the human rights dialogue but , in reality , instead have high expectations of their lucrative business interests
The European Union must not let itself be taken for a ride
On the day before the European delegation of negotiators arrived in Teheran , five people were publicly han@@ ged
The dialogue must not be a reason for failing to put the human rights situation in Iran on the agenda in international fora
That is why , in the spring , the European Union must submit a resolution to the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva
Naturally , it is important not to isolate Iran
Con@@ t@@ acts must be established , but good use must be made of these , and the reform@@ ers must be given as much support as possible
A political dialogue clause in a future agreement is not enough
In my group 's judgment , no cooperation agreement can be concluded as long as there is still gross and systematic abuse of human rights
Aid to terrorist organisations is also an obstacle to such cooperation
The situation in the country is becoming more explosive by the day , and it is therefore also high time that there were genuine reforms in Iran
There can only be constructive dealings with Iran if the truth is allowed to prevail and if supreme authority lies with the people
Mr President , it was on 23 October , not even a month ago , that we discussed , here in this Parliament , the human rights situation
We all condemned the death sentences and ston@@ ings and the general way in which this inhumane Iranian regime treats its people
In this situation the European Union is continuing to negotiate a cooperation agreement involving economic cooperation
One of the statements in the motion is inadequate in my view
It is obviously good if future cooperation agreements contain a human rights clause
We only have a limited number of options when it actually comes to bringing pressure to bear
We should not give up the possibility of exerting economic pressure on Iran
Of course it is positive that the students are going out onto the streets
Of course it is positive that President Khatami is saying that this verdict is unacceptable
Of course it is positive that the Speaker in the Iranian Parliament is taking the same line
But this has not come anywhere near to forcing a restructuring of Iranian society
I think that we too have a great responsibility here
We need to take more notice of who is put on these lists and why
We should ask more question@@ s; the European Union should not always stand to one side like a junior prison war@@ der
Mr President , the case of Dr Ag@@ ha@@ jar@@ i has rightly aroused huge interest and concern in Iran and abroad
K@@ ha@@ men@@ e@@ i 's previous record suggests rather that he is playing for time
The student demonstrations should slowly die down , as should the interest shown in the case by the public both nationally and internationally
It has , however , become clear in the demonstrations that the demonstrators are not only concerned about Dr Ag@@ ha@@ jar@@ i , but that they want more democracy altogether
In fact this verdict , like many others , is not motivated by religious concerns , but by political ones
We are familiar with this from European history , when the State and the church were not yet separate
The rulers of the time used Christianity , too , as a means of realising their own claims to power until it could no longer be recognised as such
Iranian society is , however , one step ahead of the conservative judiciary and cler@@ ics
Mr President , I disagree with Mr Markov
Iran is a complex society
There is evidence of some progress towards an Islamic society that is in tune with the modern world
President Khatami and his reformist allies are a symbol of that modernisation
However , President Khatami is being constantly frustrated by the more fundamentalist elements of Iranian society
That is why the EU is currently engaged in negotiating a trade and cooperation agreement with Iran
The death sentence on Dr H@@ as@@ hem Ag@@ ha@@ jar@@ i for apostasy on the basis of some obscure theological dispute is incomprehensible to the West
We welcome President Khatami 's intervention , the action of lecturers and students in protesting and Dr Ag@@ ha@@ jar@@ i 's own appeal for calm
Mr President , this motion is about three points
Firstly , it is about a man who is threatened with death and whom we must rescue
In this context , allow me to say a final word to Mr Markov
At that time I certainly thought that democrats should be uncompromising where totalitarian forces were concerned
That was true then , it is true today and it will also be true in the future
Professor Ag@@ ha@@ jar@@ i , who lost his right leg during the Iran@@ -@@ Iraq War , needs medical attention
He was expected to appeal to a higher court , but Professor Ag@@ ha@@ jar@@ i had the courage to de@@ fy the legal system by refusing to go to appeal
The Council also mentioned its traditional , resolute opposition to the death penalty
The dialogue on human rights is , in effect , an appropriate forum for the consideration of individual cases
The Commission will monitor developments extremely closely and remain in contact with Parliament and the Member States
In addition , the negotiation process will allow us to exert pressure while , at the same time , supporting President Khatami and the reformists
The debate is closed
The vote will take place immediately after this debate
We shall now proceed to the vote
We negotiators agreed that , by means of oral amendments and corrections , we could adapt the text if the circumstances had changed
In Recital B , where it talks about oil , it should say ' fuel ' , because we have agreed that ' fuel ' should always be included
In the Spanish version of Recital F the text ' especially birds ' appears and we had agreed that the word ' especially ' would not appear
I therefore request that the word ' especially ' be removed
The Spanish version of Recital G says ' sea craft@@ smen such as oyster farmers and seafood breeders '
I would ask that the Spanish version be corrected by saying ' sea workers such as mussel farmers , oyster farmers and other shell@@ fishermen '
And finally , in point 11 , it says ' maritime and/or fishing areas ' and , in Spanish , it should say ' mar@@ iti@@ me-@@ fishing areas '
That is all , Mr President
Mr Varela , I will see to it that all of the language versions are cross-@@ checked once more
Mr President , I requested the floor for an oral amendment to this Amendment No 1
I believe this would be more precise and it appears in this form in the agenda for this sitting
I would like to add the text ' off the coast of Galicia '
Mr President , I would like to present an oral amendment , because the amendment by the UEN Group includes Portugal
This has set the standard for future plenary sittings
Congratulations are always welcome
Mr President , did the Conference of Presidents take a decision regarding the exclusion of the two Zimbabwean diplomats who are on our banned list ?
I understand that the Conference of Presidents was to decide whether or not they should be banned from the building
I should like to know what was their decision
Mr Balfe , neither of the diplomats will be allowed to enter the House
The sinking of the ' Prestige ' was not an accident
It was the logical consequence of a mixed , national and European decision-making system , which paraly@@ ses the Member States without actually imposing the necessary radical measures
It thus leaves the way open to certain maritime transport mafias that operate in an area without law
And everything is perhaps done for that
Some of my colleagues think that we need to get out of this bad situation by imposing a central and supranational European authority
Moreover , there is no point in putting together the European Member States that are affected by the problem , and others that are not affected
That would only slow down the decisions
Without excluding European directives out of hand , they need to be supplemented by re-establishing the Member States ' right to protect themselves
We also need to admit that the Member States that are threatened must be able to take measures together , outside of Community procedures
We have had enough of the op@@ aqu@@ eness , impunity and complacency in maritime transport , which present a danger to sailors , the environment and coastal populations
In short , we need the human , material and financial resources to apply the law
Without these minimal measures , Parliament will continue to adopt ineffective resolutions every time there is an oil slick
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned
( The sitting was closed at 5
Mr President , I raise to table a point of order about the Minutes
I am now receiving the Minutes later than I did previously and I have still not received the Minutes from Wednesday
I have , on the other hand , received the Minutes from Tuesday , on which my name does not appear in the attendance register
Mr President , I should like to make a brief statement on an incident which occurred this morning at our group meeting
This particular group invited Mrs Andreas@@ sen to come and give evidence to us on a matter of technical information about the accounting systems
That is for our Bureau to decide and we would like to have clarity on that issue
It is a matter for the Conference of Presidents and not the Bureau
But Mrs Schreyer is speaking later , if you wish her to deal with this matter then she may - it will be entirely up to her
Mr President , I have a request to put to the Presidency
If my information is correct , the European Parliament has invited all the previous winners of the Sakharov Prize to Strasbourg to attend the parliamentary sitting
Would the Presidency of Parliament send an official letter to the Turkish Government to ask them to issue a special pass to Mrs Zana ?
You have the honour of sitting on the Conference of Presidents and that is a matter for the Conference of Presidents
You can write to the President
I am sure you can pick up the telephone and speak to him
The next item is the debate on the Annual Report of the Court of Auditors for 2001
Let us begin with the analysis of the implementation of the budget
For the second consecutive year there has been a high budgetary surplus , greater than EUR 15 000 million
The surplus is due to the cancellation of appropriations caused mainly by the delay in the implementation of structural measures
It would have been appropriate to modify the budget to maintain the balance between the forecast expenditure and revenue
Another crucial feature of the budgetary management was the low rate of use of payment appropriations in certain areas
In the case of the Structural Funds , percentage of use was less then 70 % , the lowest level since 1999
Delays were also a feature of the implementation of pre-accession aid , especially in the case of the SAPARD programme , where only 9
2 % of the appropriations were disbursed
What is more , only EUR 1 million were received by the final beneficiaries of this programme
If the pace of implementation does not pick up , appropriations will have to be cancelled in 2003
The Commission must continue its effort to clear the accounts by cancelling those commitments which can no longer be implemented
Out@@ standing commitments amount to EUR 12 000 million in the case of external aid and to nearly 3 000 million in the case of the new pre-accession instruments
The rate of implementation of the European Development Funds is just as sluggish
After four years , only 30 % of appropriations under the 8th EDF have been disbursed
This would result in a more accurately calculated and balanced budget
The Court has analysed the follow-up given to its previous observations
Generally speaking , the Commission has taken appropriate steps to remedy the shortcomings highlighted
In other sectors developments have been less satisfactory
This is also true of the Common Market Organisation for sugar , where , despite the 2001 reform , problems of overproduction and high prices persist
When the Audit Progress Committee starts work , I am certain that the Commission will be able to be more diligent in following up the Court 's reports
Let us now move on to the Statement of Assurance
It is the opinion of the Court that the accounts for 2001 reliably reflect the revenue and expenditure and the financial situation of the Communities
However , the Report does express some reservations and observations which for the most part concern defects in the accounting system on which the Court has previously remarked
In its reply to our Report , the Commission acknowledges these shortcomings and undertakes to present a plan to modernise the accounting system before the end of 2002
The Court will examine the conception and implementation of this plan and will keep Parliament informed of its progress
As in previous years , the Court is of the opinion that the transactions underlying the revenue , commitments and administrative expenditure are legal and regular
Nonetheless , because of the errors that we have highlighted we are unable to provide this assurance in respect of the other payments
Reducing the frequency of errors will be conting@@ ent on significant improvements in the administration and control systems of both the Commission and the Member States
Take the common agricultural policy , where the declarations submitted by the beneficiaries of subsidies have not improved compared with previous years
Other errors are linked to deficiencies in the controls carried out by the Member States
The Court 's recommendations obviously include the full implementation of the control mechanisms provided for in the Regulations
As regards structural measures , further erroneous payments were discovered , caused by deficiencies in the control systems and in the Member States ' declarations of expenditure
It recommends that the Commission intensify its checks and systematically turn the findings obtained to account
The Court recommends simplifying the systems for reimbur@@ sing expenditure and introducing more effective sanction mechanisms
The national authorities in the beneficiary countries and non-governmental organisations play a decisive role in the management system for external aid programmes
Exam@@ ination of the supporting documentation that is available centrally leads to the conclusion that the Commission has legally and regularly met its commitments and payments
The Commission must work more intensively to transform external aid - where progress has already been made
To conclude this theme , I should like to open a short paren@@ thesis
In recent months there has been lively debate concerning the Commission 's accounting system
This is a good thing , and I hope that the interest thus aroused will help to push through the reforms that the Court has long been advocating
However , in some respects the debate has suffered from a lack of precision and balance
The time has come to introduce some order and draw up an objective map of the situation
To this end , it should be stressed that , despite certain reservations , the Commission 's accounts are reliable
Accordingly , save perhaps in a few specific areas , the figures provided by the budgetary accounts correspond to the actual use made of appropriations
This view is borne out by a rigorous professional auditing effort , in which the Court has invested considerable resources
Yet this effort has also led the Court to criticise the accounting system
The shortcomings that have been highlighted make it difficult to obtain the better-@@ quality information that is necessary to improve management
I refer , for example , to the deficiencies in the system of ac@@ cru@@ als accounting when it comes to presenting the state of the Commission 's assets and liabilities
For years the Court has been drawing attention to these defects , and at last its observations appear to have elicited some response
Today we are determinedly pressing the Commission to take remedial action
When we meet here again next year we will just as determinedly demand results , which I am confident will be positive
In the meantime , I would ask that the Commission be allowed to concentrate on this task , which is not at all easy
2001 was a year of transition which was marked by significant progress , especially in the fields of financial management and internal control
Let us see what the Court 's main observations in this respect are
Firstly , I would like to point out that certain measures are not being introduced within the time limits stipulated
This delay is above all due to an overly ambitious initial timetable , as the Court has already complained
Secondly , the Council has adopted a new Financial Regulation which the Court considers generally appropriate
Despite some remaining unsatisfactory elements , this is a good instrument which will help to improve the administration of Community funds
For the first time , the Directors-General have drafted activity reports and prepared declarations on the quality of information and internal control
Increasing top managers ' accountability in this way is one of the keys to the reform 's success
This is a genuine revolution in the Commission 's management culture
The Commission has summarised the reports and declarations by the Directors-General in a single document which it has submitted to Parliament and the Council
This summary includes a plan of action which aims to remedy the problems that have been identified
The plan should provide more detail on issues such as the monitoring of internal control standards and the reform of S@@ IN@@ COM
Finally , one aspect of the reform deserves greater attention
I refer to the Member States ' management of programmes under what is known as ' shared management '
it needs the active collaboration of national governments
I believe that this message provides an appropriate conclusion to my speech
The reform is progressing positively
The Commission has met its commitment to work hard on improving its administrative and control practices
However , it will take more time to achieve the excellent and exemplary administration we all want to see
It is a laborious process to which all the institutions must contribute their experience
Each year the Court will analyse the progress made , report on the deficiencies and recommend any measures it considers necessary
I thank you very much for your attention
With the Statement of Assurance specifically in mind , I am also grateful for their frankness about the methodology applied
I will follow Mr F@@ ab@@ ra V@@ all@@ és in concentrating on three points , specifically the surplus from 2001 , accounting , and Commission reform
The surplus represents the difference between the estimates and cash data as set out in the revenue and expenditure accounts , in line with the accountability required by Parliament
Why was there such a great discrepancy in structural expenditure ?
The Financial Regulation requires that any surplus from a financial year be credited to the Member States as income for the following year
We have done this principally by way of two supplementary Budgets , an instrument that also featured in discussions on the Financial Regulation
The Court subjects the financial management including of course the cash position , to detailed scrutiny
It is , then , quite simply wrong to assert that the Commission 's books and cash position have not been aud@@ ited for ten years
The Court examines in detail the accounts and the standards by which they are kept
The Court has again expressed reservations about the balance sheet , and is calling for further changes to be made to the system
Having gained the impression that there is confusion about this , let me follow the President of the Court of Auditors in making a basic observation to clarify matters
This system is therefore in line with accountability to the budgetary authority
We have committed ourselves to continued development , which the Court has also expressly en@@ joined on us , including improvements to the underlying computer system
They are obliged to feed everything into one single system , and the Budget Directorate-General then carries out the actual transactions
A number of steps have been taken to improve this
Mr Elles , if your group has come to the decision that it should seek help from elsewhere , that is manifestly its own business
Turning to the third area - that of the reforms - the measures taken by the Commission are many in number and far-reaching in their effects
You will be aware that , in the area of the Budget , activity-based budgeting is changing the way in which the Budget is drawn up
Another major change is the strategic planning using the Annual Policy Strategy within the Commission
The offices of the Internal Audit Service and the Central Financial Service have been set up in the same way
The most crucial aspect , though , is the decentralisation of responsibility and accountability , as described by the Directors-General in their report
This too involves new structures , such as annual reporting for example
This would reduce the number of possible critic@@ is@@ ms; this is a very good , indeed essential proposal , and one that we shall adopt
It will make the Budget Commissioner 's work easier , as also that of the Committee on Budgetary Control
I would also like to address a few words to the principal rapporteur , Mr Casaca
Work on the discharge procedure has already begun , and the questionnaire you have submitted is a comprehensive one
For its part , the Commission will do all it takes to give you satisfactory answers in due time , that is to say by 18 December
In Chapter I , the Court reiterates the call it made in the previous year for a supplementary and amending Budget to be presented in good time
The Commission 's response to this may well be technically correct , but it is not the right one politically
There is still a great deal of work to be done here
What the Court has to say in Chapter 9 of the Statement of Assurance is most interesting , but , at the same time , gives rise to grave concern
Again , with the exception of a few areas , certification of the accounts is withheld
The question arises of whether the top no@@ tch on this yardstick will ever be reached
In terms of discharge , the really important things will be a series of items such as Commission reform , financial management and the new Financial Regulation
The reliability of the Commission 's accounting system has been the subject of vigorous debate , which the media have broadcast far and wide
The Committee on Budgetary Control was prevented from hearing the arguments of the Commission 's accounting officer , who has since been suspended
What we now read in the Court 's report - on pages 308 ff
for example - paints a pretty grim picture of deficits that have been present in the Commission 's book-@@ keeping and accounting procedures for years
I will end with two questions
The first is whether 2001 saw an improvement in Budget implementation
It is the discharge resolution that will provide the answer to that
under the Treaty , it is the Commission that is responsible for the management of the Budget as a whole
The new Financial Regulation gives its Directorates-General decentralised responsibility
Who , though , in the Commission , is responsible for the monitoring of the whole within the Commission itself ?
So let me express my gratitude for that
I want to say something about the points that have already featured in numerous comments , such as , for example , the issue of the accounting system
She was to provide additional evidence of the things that the Court of Auditors ' comments had in any case already denounced
We then learned from an article in a newspaper published here in Brussels , that she was not willing to do so
This is also part of the story and should not be concealed
I noted down what Mr F@@ ab@@ ra V@@ all@@ és said , in very diplomatic language , about the other point - that there was a lack of rigour and objectivity
Of course we do not include in that the Commission 's expressions of delight at the state of the accounting system
We will not let them get away with telling us that this could not be done , because work had to be done on the new Financial Regulation
If these explanations prove to be less than satisfactory , things are going to get unpleasant for everyone involved
That , I can promise you , is when things will turn ugly
Mr President , thank you in any case for giving me the floor
I should like to start on a positive note
I am also pleased that the Court of Auditors notes that the Commission is functioning ever more effectively
The Court of Auditors takes a positive view of Commission reform , and the same more or less goes for the new Financial Regulation
This is the good news
The bad news is that a positive Statement of Assurance has not yet been issued this year either
I should like to repeat what I said last year and the year before
Why can the Commission not be more specific and set a date by which we must have a positive Statement of Assurance ?
It would be something we could all work towards and we would know what to expect
It is also disappointing to perceive no real improvement in European unification 's oldest policy area , namely that of agricultural policy
Once again , the Court of Auditors is assessing agricultural spending very critically , and there appears to me to be hardly any tangible improvement
This is why I took the initiative earlier this year to better control agricultural spending
It is also this year for the first time that the Directors-General of the Commission will be required to account for healthy financial management
I think that this will be essential in the future
As everything that needed to be said about the surplus on the budget has already been said , I will not enter into any great detail on this subject
Su@@ ffice to say that we naturally need to budget more effectively
I would also like to say a few words about the Statement of Assurance itself
This is the same message I am having to repeat
We should be able to judge , from one year to the next , whether things have generally improved by a certain percentage
Everyone likes to know the final score , and this should also be possible for the European Budget
One major point that is left is enlargement
The Court of Auditors itself admits that even the current Member States leave a great deal to be desired on this score
As far as I am aware , the IACS has not yet become operational in any of the new Member States
This is a point of grave concern and something which will require attention particularly in future
Mr President , once again we have an annual report , this time for 2001 , which contains very serious criticism from the Court of Auditors on several points
As previously , there are very concrete cases in a number of areas where EU funds are being used entirely wrongly , especially within agricultural policy
The report also points to the enormous surplus of EUR 15 billion , in other words 16 % of the budget
This criticism was very clear both in the report and during its presentation to the committee
This in itself is unprecedented and something that must be taken incredibly seriously
In addition , the changes seem to be taking a long time
The Court of Auditors ' report states that , in May this year , the action plan which is to lead to improvements had not even begun to be implemented
Despite this serious criticism of the accounting system , the statement of assurance nevertheless states that the transactions have been carried out correctly
In my view , this is highly contradictory
In principle , it is impossible to claim both these things at the same time
One cannot both point to an accounting system which cannot be followed and be able to guarantee that everything has been managed correctly
I question whether this statement of assurance is actually justified
We all know about the vehe@@ ment criticism of the accounts from former chief accountant Mrs Mar@@ ta Andreasen
She also refused to sign off the accounts for 2001
I would like to ask the Court of Auditors whether they understand this , considering the criticism that the Court of Auditors itself has put forward
Is it not the case that not signing off the accounts is quite a reasonable position to adopt ?
Another interesting view from Mrs Mar@@ ta Andreasen is that fast improvements can be implemented without new investment in the Commission
It would be interesting to hear the opinion of the Court of Auditors on this matter too
I am also a little surprised about this debate where the criticism made by Mrs Andreasen is being dismissed
It may be the case that it is incorrect but , if this is the case , why may we not hear this criticism ?
Why do the other political groups here in the European Parliament not want a hearing ?
Why is the Commission in practice g@@ ag@@ ging Mrs Andreasen when members of the European Parliament have invited her in to make our audit work easier ?
It is not a particularly attractive development
Mr President , I should first of all like to concur with Mr Kuhne on the subject of the transparent and open way in which we cooperate
I could be asking my fellow MEPs a whole string of questions today
2 % of the resources have been used
These are all important questions , which we will be addressing together with the rapporteur , Mr Casaca , over the next few weeks and months
In my view , there is only one important question left today
Members of the Court of Auditors , you know that I am on good terms with the Court
You will be aware that I am that MEP
When I heard about those allegations , I passed them on to OLAF
I specifically did not want any publicity at the time
I wanted to see whether OLAF would do its job , and I have to compliment the OLAF investigators on doing a sterling job
A few weeks ago , they submitted a dossier to the Court of Justice in Luxembourg
They also submitted a dossier to the Court of Auditors itself with a number of recommendations
I understand that a request has also been made for a financial reimbursement to the tune of EUR 28 000
Members of the Court of Auditors , I should like to ask you for your official reaction to the OLAF inquiry
Will you be taking on board the recommendations that the Court of Auditors has made ?
Can you also give me permission to examine this OLAF dossier myself ?
Thirdly , can you assure me that the case involving Mrs N is an isolated one and that it is not common practice within the Court of Auditors ?
If all this happened , the board of directors would , firstly , refuse to give discharge to the management
It would then get rid of the management
After that , the taxation authorities would turn up and seize all the business 's accounts documentation for critical analysis
Afterwards , the business would have its taxes raised to the tune of the undo@@ cu@@ mented expenditure , and finally there would be talk of criminal liability
This is just the approach we take for private business
If the criticism was unjustified , as the Commission claims , we would of course clear this up , and all would be well
However , the Commission knows , and the European Court of Auditors has confirmed , that the criticism is justified , and therefore it must not come to light
I find the report very enlightening
The problem is that we do not dare to back our criticism up with action
It appears that the Commission hardly takes any notice of the criticisms and recommendations contained in this annual report
Is this really going to change this year ?
We are tired of the Commission 's delaying tactics and of its beating about the bush
Is the President of the Court of Auditors of the opinion that a more independent position in respect of the Commission could considerably enhance the effectiveness of his institution ?
Given the virtually built-in surplus in the Structural Fund policy , this is due for a thorough overhaul , also in view of the EU 's impending enlargement
In addition to better control , an integral policy evaluation is needed as a matter of urgency
Can the Court of Auditors indicate whether the unaltered course of the present Structural Fund policy after 2004 will lead to even greater administrative problems ?
These are two things that I feel are important in the context of the debate that we are holding
I sometimes tell myself that ' we are learning nothing ' or as the Latin saying goes ' o@@ porte@@ t ut scand@@ ala even@@ i@@ at
That is the question that is essentially being raised
We look forward to your forthcoming decision
It is a shame that it is caused by a situation that we have recently experienced
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the President of the Court of Auditors , Mr F@@ ab@@ ra V@@ all@@ és , on the report he has presented to us
It is a rigorous , clear and very focused report , which provides us with precise information on how the budget has been implemented
A similar thing is also happening in the case of agricultural policy
As in previous years , the Court believes that actions should be taken to modify the current system in order to improve it
I believe it is also necessary to point out the reference to the internal reform of the Commission and the slow@@ ness with which it is taking place
I do not wish to elaborate on the previous speeches
I would like to congratulate Mr F@@ ab@@ ra V@@ all@@ és once again
There is absolutely no doubt that his experience as a former member of the Committee on Budgetary Control has been a great help to him in carrying out his work
The rules are also taking on an absurd and increasing complexity , which is out of step with reality
The transparency of relations between the European institutions and the outside world is a recurring concern
It is therefore crucial to make the fight for transparency and fairness part of our daily work
Mr President , many things have been said about the Commission 's accounting system in the last six months
The Commission acknowledges most of the defects that the Court of Auditors points out
I am now looking forward to a frank and serious discussion between the Commission and Parliament , so that we can finally get this cleared up
It is politically untenable that auditors ' criticisms keep on coming
If something is wrong , it must be put right
I wish to hold the Commission to this promise , and I welcome the action plan
Mr President , I too welcome the Court of Auditors ' report but I wonder about the statement just made by Mr F@@ ab@@ ra V@@ all@@ és
It has a very interesting spin on the words you have actually written within your report
You mention in your statement a lack of balance in what is being said in the public arena at the moment and I agree with this
These reservations most often have their roots in the weakness of the accounting system and in the low awareness of the Commission 's operational DGs etc
If , as you just said in your statement , the accounts are so reliable , then why write those things in your report ?
If the accounts are so good , why did so many heads of departments refuse to sign their own accounts off without reservations ?
Finally , I have one or two questions for the Commissioner because I am quite sure that you are a wise political manoeuv@@ rer , Commissioner Schreyer
So please , with that sort of political n@@ ous that you have , could you just answer a handful of very short questions for me ?
Who did sign off within the Commission the accounts in 2001 ?
I think I have tabled this question to you and also a whole host of journalists have asked you this
We would really like that answer
Was it some secretary ?
Was it the commercial engineer you have employed as the Chief Accoun@@ tant of the Commission presently ?
What is going on within your systems ?
We want reform
Mr President , I would also like to thank the Court of Auditors for its report again this year
I am extremely disappointed that this is the first occasion on which the Court has been able to present its audit this year
The way the report has been set out has improved a little bit@@ ; however , I think the document itself is still largely impenetrable
We hope , President , that you will continue in your efforts to make this clearer in future
The main issue on which the Budget Control Committee is likely to concentrate this year is of course the accounting system of the Commission
This is not because Mar@@ ta Andreas@@ sen has told us that we should do that , but because the Court has been pointing out these failures since 1994
The fact is that the Commission has been extremely slow in instig@@ ating those reforms and we still are unlikely to see a complete radical reform until 2005
I think this is an unacceptable degree of complacency
We must go much further and set a more ambitious timetable
But we are being tough on you and we want to push you to meet the standards of the best
We want to see more money coming into EU coffers from the fines that should be imposed on Members States who fail to respect directives
Mr President , aware as I am of your usual agenda , I would like to thank you most sincerely for being here
As far as I am concerned , naturally , as far as I know , that confidence is complete and absolute
But not only confidence in him , but in the whole House , in all the Members , but I am aware of the usual good work of Mr Casaca
Furthermore , issues relating to the DAS have been mentioned
We are often asked when we will be able to provide a positive DAS
Because I am sure that it will be the Commission that recti@@ fies and controls itself
Why do we not give the error rate ?
I have said several times , whenever I am asked , that the error rate provides limited information and may lead to distorted interpretations
I therefore believe it is better not to provide this information
We are then told that we could provide the DAS by sector
And I say ' if only ' because if we had the resources to carry out a DAS by sector , you may rest assured that we would do so
And you may be sure that we would derive much more information
Therefore , what the error rate indicates are errors and what we have to look at is the background to these errors
That is the reason
Mr Staes asked me a question about the case of Mrs N
I therefore believe it is prudent to wait for the So@@ lic@@ it@@ or@@ -General in Luxembourg to assess the documentation provided to him by OLAF
But it should be noted that at this very moment there is a group of members of the Court working on this issue
To get as much as possible done before the So@@ lic@@ it@@ or@@ -General gives his opinion , whatever that opinion may be and whatever assessment he sees fit to make
Mr Dell' Alba said that he is worried
And we should all be because whether the Commission improves or not depends on all of us
But I must say that I have found a completely different situation
A Commission in which I see daily changes
You say these changes cannot yet be seen in the final result ?
Because this is not simply a face-@@ lift
If it were simply a face-@@ lift , a nip and a t@@ uck , and the results would be visible very soon
The Commission is undergoing a profound change
And therefore until next year I am sure we will not see any changes
And I would say to Mrs Morgan that of course we are making an effort
We hope that this work will be increasingly useful to you
I am prepared to commit myself to this , of course
It seems that it is not yet sufficient , but I promise , Mrs Morgan , that next year we will make a further effort
Mr President , I should briefly like to refer back to my speech
I asked the President of the Court of Auditors three questions , two of which were left unanswered
I specifically asked him whether I would be able to gain access to the dossier drafted by OLAF following the submission of my fraud dossier to the Court of Auditors
He failed to give me an answer to this
Thirdly , I should say that I am extremely dissatisfied with his response
' we have submitted a dossier to the judicial authorities in Luxembourg '
I now hear that the Court of Auditors is waiting for the judicial inquiry in Luxembourg
I fear that this will take years and years , as is customary in Belgian courts
I should still urge the Court of Auditors to do as OLAF has recommended
Mr Staes , I am sorry for having left some of your questions out
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the Copenhagen European Council on 12 and 13 December 2002 , including the institutional aspects of enlargement
Let me start with the latter
I am quite sure that the meeting is fresh in their minds
Enlargement will be the most important item on the agenda of the European Council meeting in Copenhagen
For some months the pace of the accession negotiations has been very fast
As you know , the Brussels European Council concluded that ten countries will be ready for membership from the beginning of 2004
The final and decisive negotiations are now taking place
Last week , the Presidency presented a negotiating package for each of the candidate countries
These packages represent the Presidency 's proposal for a definitive resolution of the negotiations
The Presidency hopes that we can cover a lot of ground - as much as possible - in the negotiations before the European Council meeting in Copenhagen
It is no secret that the final negotiations will not be easy
Given the right willingness to compromise on the part of both present and future Member States , however , I am convinced that we shall achieve a successful result
Enlargement does not end in Copenhagen , however
The European Council also wants to give new impetus to the accession process for Bulgaria and Romania
A decision will be taken on detailed road@@ maps and timetables , and pre-accession aid , in order to move forward the accession process with Bulgaria and Romania
The Commission 's communication of 13 November on a roadmap for the two countries is a good step in the right direction
At the last European Council meeting , in October , the EU welcomed the new reform work in Turkey
The countries of the EU were unanimous in emphasising that the many important reforms in Turkey have expe@@ dited the start of accession negotiations with that country
Turkey 's accession will follow the same principles and criteria as those applied to the other candidate countries
The EU is in the process of preparing the decision on the next step in Turkey 's candidature
This decision will be taken at the Copenhagen European Council
The Presidency hopes that a solution to the Cyprus issue can be found ahead of Copenhagen
The EU supports wholeheartedly the UN Secretary-General 's endeavours to find a solution
I myself have had the pleasure of informing Parliament at all stages of these deliberations
The Presidency fully understands Parliament 's keen interest in the institutional consequences of enlargement , and is willing to enter into an open discussion on these matters
At the same time , I must also draw attention to the complicated negotiating process under way at this time with regard to enlargement
It can be said , therefore , that it is an ongoing , intensive process in which we do not have all the answers yet
The institutional questions are pressing
They are a necessary part of enlargement as a whole
Questions such as the weighting of individual countries ' votes in the Council and the countries ' representation in the European Parliament constitute an essential part of the accession treaty
We need to make a start now on laying down clear provisions for the transitional period
What we are talking about is primary legislation in line with the treaty
We owe it to the future members not to delay accession for any longer than is absolutely necessary
This means that there is a need for certain transitional arrangements
This was also the case with previous enlargements
It has been suggested in Parliament that the 2004 elections to the European Parliament be held on an earlier date , for example 9 May
I personally sympathise with this view
All sorts of dates have been considered , but in vain
Unfortunately , I do not believe that further attempts to change the date will bear fruit
It is not the Presidency , however , that is standing in the way of a different , earlier , date
Obviously redistributing the portfolios within the Commission for a period of just half a year is not a satisfactory solution
The Presidency hopes Parliament accepts that the interim Commissioners from the new countries will not be subject to hearings or approval by Parliament
This avoids any possibility of prejudicing the new Parliament 's opinion of the new Commission
The proposed solution avoids any possibility of prejudicing the choice of candidates by the President-@@ designate of the European Commission in the composition of the new Commission
Lastly , there is the question of the full participation of the new Member States in the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference
The Council has a clearly defined position on this matter
The new Member States must be placed on an equal footing with the old Member States in the negotiations that will shape their and our common future
And , like the old Member States , they must of course have the right of veto
We cannot in decency do otherwise
I have endeavoured to explain the complicated institutional consequences of enlargement
I am looking forward to our debate
I will listen very carefully and am open to all good suggestions for realistic alternative solutions
The Council will discuss the institutional consequences of enlargement once more at the General Affairs Council meeting on Monday and Tuesday
It has already been agreed that I shall be present myself at the meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on 10 December
This will be an opportunity for me to brief the competent parliamentary committee on the latest developments , and for a discussion on their significance
The Seville European Council instructed the Danish Presidency to continue working on the question as to how the presidency will function in the future in an enlarged EU
The Presidency was to present an initial report at the meeting in Copenhagen
This will mean that we can have an initial orientation debate on the subject there
It is not the intention that the European Council will take a decision on the models
At the meeting in Copenhagen , the Chairman of the Convention will give a report on the progress that has been made in the Convention
This dialogue is very important
With the presentation , last month , of a draft Constitutional Treaty , the work of the Convention entered a decisive phase
The discussions on the details within the framework the chairman presented are making rapid progress
The basis for the Convention 's end product is now being created
It bodes well for our common ambition to create European cooperation which is more democratic and has grass-roots support
As will have been clear from my statement , the European Council has an extensive and ambitious agenda for its meeting
And , as I said at the start , this great project can only succeed if the three institutions work closely together
I particularly note your intention to attend a meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on 10 December 2002 to take up some of these institutional questions
I recall that later in that week in Copenhagen , we will have a meeting of the Conference of Presidents with the Danish Prime Minister
Almost ten years on , we are nearing the end of that process
At the end of next week , the Heads of State and Government will be back in the Danish capital to take the final decisions
What is on the agenda at Copenhagen ?
I will expand on these three points today
I think the recommendations we are getting from the Council can , if necessary , be revised and supplemented to accommodate Parliament 's specific needs in the best way possible
I suggest we organise things in the most practical order and , where the Treaty is silent , that we use common sense
Politically , it is highly significant that the European elections should be at the centre of the institutional activities related to enlargement
How is the Copenhagen Summit shaping up in terms of the main point on the agenda - enlargement ?
The European Council 's conclusions were presented immediately to the Heads of State and Government of the candidate countries , who reacted favourably to them on the whole
Nonetheless , many issues still have to be resolved before an agreement acceptable to all concerned can be reached
The Presidency of the Council and the Commission have worked - and will continue to work - ceas@@ elessly to reach an agreement
Without going into detail on the discussions under way , I will outline some of the main points
Firstly , we need to find a suitable way of respecting a principle we all agree on
In 2004 , 2005 and 2006 the net amounts received by the candidate countries from the European Union should not be lower than those they receive in 2003
Secondly , the candidate countries need assistance to prepare better for the task of controlling the Union 's external borders
This means enabling them to carry out their tasks under Schengen properly
Lastly , we need to solve certain specific points relating to the agricultural policy
First and foremost , the Commission fully supports the Danish Presidency in its efforts to reach the necessary compromise on all these matters
Some Member States have expressed reservations regarding the substance of the offer to the candidate countries
We , however , do not share their view
We must keep within the overall framework laid down at the Brussels European Council , but openness , flexibility and generosity are also needed
Secondly , last week , I appealed publicly to the leaders of the candidate countries to show realism in this last lap of the negotiations
Indeed , I note that many points are still unresolved and we have only a few days left
We are sk@@ ating on thin ice and progress must be made
There are times in history when narrow sectoral interests , however legitimate , must give way before the general interest
That is the law of democracy and we must apply it
I want to reiterate earnestly that most of the points of the final compromise must be decided at the forthcoming General Affairs Council meeting on 9 and 10 December
We cannot leave the Copenhagen European Council to decide on dozens and dozens of details
Therefore , ladies and gentlemen , before this House , I appeal to the good sense of the leaders of the candidate countries and the leaders of the Fifteen
The remaining difficulties must be settled quickly in the same spirit of partnership and friendship that has presided over all the accession negotiations
I would also like to comment on the latest developments regarding the conclusion of the negotiations with Cyprus
That plan has our full backing
The reactions of the parties concerned have , on the whole , been positive
They have accepted these proposals as an appropriate basis for a settlement and , in the next few days , they will respond with their proposals
We hope these contributions will allow Mr Kofi Annan to make more progress towards a solution
In any case , the commitments entered into at Helsinki remain valid for the candidacy of Cyprus
As you know , these two countries have proposed 2007 as their target date for accession and the Commission believes no effort must be spared to achieve that target
This House has already had occasion to debate the issue at length
The report the Commission presented on Turkey in October was based on objective information that no one disputed
It noted Turkey 's progress towards meeting the Copenhagen political criteria
It also noted the remaining difficulties
In short , Turkey has come a long way but much remains to be done
The new Turkish Government 's legislative programme confirms this
The European Union must encourage this process
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the prospect of approaching membership of the Union has given millions of Europeans a new political and economic perspective
H@@ ope is the ra@@ rest and most valuable commodity in politics
History has not been kind to these peoples recently , but now they have the hope of a better future - a future of dignity , freedom and prosperity
It prompts a number of observations on the subject of Copenhagen
For a start , we have not yet reached the objective
But I am also addressing the Member States , who must resist the temptation to tie the great decision on enlargement to the advancement of certain national interests
It is with a certain amount of concern that I see the first attempts being made at wrap@@ ping up packages that are not appropriate
Thirdly , we have to achieve an outcome in which there are no winners or losers
Those who think in terms of winners and losers will fail
We have to achieve an outcome in which there are only winners , one in which the principal vic@@ tor is Europe as a whole
That is an argument that is not easy to counter , and so I hope that there will be some movement here
I really have to tell you that one problem is the result , quite simply , of the rules we have made for the European Union
It is that problem that we have at the moment
This country will have great burdens laid upon it , burdens that it cannot bear alone , and it will be dependent on help from the international community
The sooner the international community declares its readiness to provide this aid , the greater , perhaps , will be the willingness to do as the United Nations proposes
All things considered , I believe that we can be satisfied with the position that we have reached
What we now need is a final great effort , an effort made in full awareness of the fact that time is running out
We have often spoken of a window of opportunity
I had no ink@@ ling of just how true that is
We must all be aware that if we do not act now , every month in which we hesitate will make things more and more difficult
I am firmly convinced that it would take only six months for the Budget situation in the Member States to make a solution almost impossible
So I can only say that it must be done now , and all parties must , in heart and mind , surmount the obstacles
from Copenhagen to Copenhagen
I wish the summit of Heads of State and Government under Danish presidency great success , in order that we may tackle the issues that remain to be resolved
This summit in Copenhagen must become a summit for enlargement
We must not end up in a situation in which Turkey is the sole topic for discussion
That must stand centre-@@ stage
Copenhagen must consum@@ m@@ ate the historic process of the 1980s and 1990s , and , to that end , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , we wish you much success
Speaking on behalf of our group , I would also like to remind you that , even if the Danish proposal is accepted , we still have EUR 2
3@@ 91 billion in hand , on the assumption that the figure , to which Commissioner Verheugen referred , is correct
We therefore call on the governments to achieve a result in Copenhagen
Hence the demand that the Heads of State and Government should do something now and make a result possible
There are criteria for accession , and they include such things as the law
We firmly reject the idea that Copenhagen should name a date for negotiations
Some are very strongly in favour of Turkish membership , while others advocate a strategic or privileged partnership
This is indeed normal in a large group , and I am sure that other groups differ but little
I therefore recommend that we rely on the firm foundations of European law and criteria
If you take a different line , our assessment of the Danish Presidency 's achievements will be less favourable than it has been so far
We now hear from Turkey that the Cyprus issue will not be resolved if they are not given a date
I have one further comment to make to the Commission on the post-@@ 1 May 2004 order
Our recommendation to the Council and to the Commission is that no decision , whether anticip@@ atory or otherwise , should be taken without reference to Parliament
We are prepared to be flexible in any way that will be appropriate , but what you can depend on is that we will always defend Parliament 's rights
It is on this basis that we seek good cooperation with all the institutions of the European Union
I believe we must wish the Danish Presidency luck in its task since this is a very important moment
Vice-President Titley and other colleagues from my group will deal with all aspects of this issue
I still maintain that criticism
I have listened carefully to President-in-Office Haarder and President Prodi
It was said that its mandate would last until January and now it turns out that the date for the end of the Commission 's operations is being brought forward
It is never made to coincide with the elections , which worries me very much
In other words , we will not know what the absolute majority in this Parliament is nor what its membership will be over the next legislature
This has not therefore been done well and it causes many problems
Furthermore , I do not believe it makes any sense to have Commissioners spending several months with nothing to do in the Commission
I hoped that in the ' trialogue ' , as President Prodi said , there would be progress on this issue
Neither the Council nor the Commission are God , and neither are we the D@@ evil
I will briefly respond to Mr Barón Crespo
I should not now enter the debate
We know that enlargement will make us more multi-cultural and more competitive
I trust that the European Council and the Commission will be generous to Turkey in this respect
We should throw ourselves behind the process of regime change which is taking place in Turkey
It will certainly be far more possible for them to accept a UN settlement should there be a firm prospect of membership for mother@@ land Turkey itself
We are facing a kind of evaluation , and the time has come to hand out a little praise , and of course a small amount of criticism , too
I wish to commend the Danish Presidency for managing to secure the release of Ak@@ h@@ med Zak@@ a@@ yev before the great Copenhagen Summit gets under way
It was a splendid decision and means that many of my worst fears have fortunately not come true
I also wish to praise the Presidency for its hard work on enlargement
I also wish to point out , as Mr Verheugen did , that it is not over yet
I hope that the citizens of the applicant countries do not look at the two things side by side and become frustrated
I hope for a ' yes ' vote
What are the practical demands we are making of them ?
What are the deadlines ?
When must the individual parts of the human rights and democracy projects be implemented in Turkey in order that we can set the final date ?
It is obvious that it is not possible to give a fixed date right now , with fundamental aspects still not in place and many decisions yet to be implemented
A date for a date , however , would be the right thing to do
There are a couple of things , however , that have disappointed me about the Danish Presidency
I am disappointed that it did not manage to do something about the Statute of the Ombudsman
I am disappointed that it is still not possible for the Ombudsman to obtain the documents he asks for
I should like to hear where the Presidency stands on the plans to put the Iranian resistance movement on the list of terrorist organisations
We have a problem , and I should like to hear the views of the Danish Presidency on this
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we always have the option of saying the same thing at every meeting
It is unacceptable for the Council to set one timetable and for the Commission to set another
We must reach an interinstitutional agreement
Once this agreement has been reached , it is up to Members of Parliament to come to an agreement , because different points of view coexist within this House
We must find an interim solution for the new commissioners during the six-month period
That is the most important thing
As far as Turkey is concerned , we must be responsible
We cannot decide on Turkey 's accession plan now
There are some possibilities of Turkey joining the EU , but there are also some arguments against its accession
President Clinton had even said that Russia should definitely be part of Europe
So we say to the US that Mexico and Canada must be part of the United States
I do not understand why it is up to the US to decide who must be part of Europe
I believe , therefore , that this question remains open
It would be an extraordinary manifestation of Turkey 's goodwill
This is what can be done in the near future , Mr President
It would certainly be an extraordinary gesture before Copenhagen if the Turkish Government allowed Mrs Zana to come to the meeting of all the Sakharov Prize winners
This is how we could move things forward
financially , our proposals for enlargement will not be enough , not by a long shot
The Council is wrong , the Commission is wrong
We cannot operate on the same budget with 25 Member States as we did with 15
We always have to repeat the same thing
One day , you will understand history and the meaning of history
Enlargement to welcome ten new States and tens of millions of new European citizens into the EU is both a bold gesture and the accomplishment of our true European destiny
I also hope that a genuine and significant decision will be made in relation to the Turkish application for membership
Mr President , the Copenhagen Summit will be a historic event
Ten countries will be able to join the EU from 2004 , two countries from 2007 , and Turkey will probably be given a date for its next meeting
Europe is growing together , which is a good thing
However , the EU membership that is now being negotiated is not the kind the applicant countries will actually receive
The completion of the new constitution is planned for before the new countries join , with their right of veto in matters of treaty amendments
This is unfair , as Mr Haarder also said
They must not join as second-class members , but instead have equal rights from day one
I also think that we could be much more accommodating with regard to the funding of their membership of the EU
We should bear in mind that EC and EU membership is , of course , not just something one receives
For some it is actually very expensive insurance , as ordinary people have to pay contributions via their daily purchases of everyday goods and via national taxation
Everyone has to pay , but only very few receive subsidies from the EU budget
Mr President , Mr Bonde first became a Member of Parliament - as I did - in July 1979
As a communist activist , he was elected to uphold the need to stop Denmark acceding to Europe
Over 20 years on , you have heard what our dear Mr Bonde has to say about the management of the situation before us
In 1979 , Mr Cohn-Bendit was probably still much more revolutionary than we are as European federalists , persistently liberal , persistently anti-fascist , anti-@@ communist , anti-@@ fundamentalist and federalist
Today , things have changed
Today , Mr Cohn-Bendit said something very interesting , but he presented it as a paradox
The United States is proposing that we speed up the time frames for Turkey 's entry into Europe
Mr Cohn-Bendit says that it is as if we were to call upon the United States to speed up their feder@@ alising process and get on with annex@@ ing Canada and Mexico
What has all this got to do with Copenhagen ?
This story is paradoxical
This means that the creative spirit is not free to flow where it will
We must fight for freedom and for Europe
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs , expressing the opinion that emerged on the institutional implications of enlargement
These implications , starting with the initial time frames , warrant a great deal of attention in our view , and they must be addressed with all due rigour
I will , however , specify the points which we consider to be essential
Firstly , we believe that transitional arrangements relating to the composition of both the Commission and the European Parliament must be kept to a minimum or avoided
The Council has specified the date of 1 May 2004 for the formal entry into the Union of the new Member States
I do not believe that this can be in the interests of the candidate countries of the future Member States
The President-in-Office has told us that such attempts have failed in the past
We do not see why they should fail again and we feel that an effort must be made to adopt that solution
At the same time , a decision needs to be taken to bring forward the end of the Commission 's mandate
We would like to know how this tal@@ lies with Article 48 of the Treaty
We believe that an acceptable solution would be for them to have the same status for the purposes of the IGC that they have for the purposes of the Convention
Mr President , for the record , my name is pronounced van Velzen
I should like to say that we are currently facing an historic moment
I have no option but to conclude from the Commission report that the Member States wishing to accede still have to sort out an awful lot of things
Another area of concern to which more attention should be given is media pluralism in Central and Eastern Europe
The past has shown us all that , let us say , the old establishment set aside resources and created opportunities in order to keep their own media intact
I also think that we should not combine enlargement with the debate on Turkey
If we do engage in such a discussion at present , we would of course be flouting our own laws and rules , as Mr Poettering has already pointed out
This is why we are , actually , in a kind of virtual debate and are doing silly things to boot
We like to mention a date for the sake of naming the date
Good luck to anyone who can explain this to citizens in the European Union
I am therefore in favour of abandoning this curious debate
We cannot get away from Turkey 's need to meet the Copenhagen criteria , and the fact that it does not do so at the moment
Consequently , we should stop wasting any more time on this
Imagine if Member States were to set dates at this stage which are at the moment not based on fact
I wonder whether we should not concentrate on making the package more tailor-made
The Danish Presidency has set a good example in this
I would therefore urge some sort of creativity in this area
However , we should also consider how we can speed up the cash flow so that these Member States do not end up having major problems
we have an enormous opportunity in Copenhagen , and we should seize it
I warned that we should not celebrate prematurely the end of this process because there was still a long way to go and of course I was right
For once , I disagree with Commissioner Verheugen
This is the opportunity we have to seize
This is not a constantly el@@ astic process
At some point we must say no
Berlin and Brussels cannot be breached
The moment we break budget discipline , we open a whole Pandora 's box which is liable to bring the whole project collapsing to the ground
We also must be clear that this project is so important that we are not prepared to let any one country sabotage the whole negotiations
Equally , I must urge our leaders to ask themselves a simple question before they go to Copenhagen
Let us think of the big picture and remember that the money we are giving to the accession countries represents one thous@@ and@@ th of the GDP of the European Union
The entire EU budget is only two thirds of what the British Government spends on social security alone
We are actually talking about what are minor issues in the global picture of things
Let us not lose sight of that
We want you to meet it by such and such a date and if you do we will open negotiations
But let us kill off once and for all this idea that Europe is a Christian project only
This is the message some people in this chamber are giving out and we must kill that off
In the European Union , solidarity stops when it comes to money
The Member States ' mean@@ -minded attitude leaves the candidate countries with the impression that they are second-class citizens who are not welcome
That puts wind in the sails of the EU 's opponents in those countries , and jeopardises its acceptance
Sav@@ ings in the Structural Funds mean savings in cohesion , in the very heart of the European Union , and thus have adverse effects on the project of integration
That is sending the wrong signal
Without that , the result will be social collapse , the European Union 's spirit will be endangered and so will the project for EU reform
to conclude accession negotiations with ten candidate countries
Everything should therefore balance out in the end
The second major item on the Copenhagen agenda will be Turkey 's candidacy
We share Mr Giscard d' Estaing 's view that , as things currently stand , Turkey 's accession would spell the end of the European Union
We have , in fact , said this several times before
The 1999 Helsinki European Council made a serious mistake , which has unfortunately not been made good , but has since been confirmed
This error on the part of the Union shows its lack of understanding of what it is and its ignorance of what it wants
Mr President of the European Parliament , you yourself have suggested that Mr Giscard d' Estaing , by adopting this position , would be removed from his role
What is our model for the Union for the next fifty years ?
Where must our borders end ?
Mr Giscard d' Estaing is therefore doing exactly the right thing by raising these questions indirectly
It is in Europe 's own interests to put things right as soon as possible
I am convinced that , of all the political events we have experienced , it is this one that will be the most important for all the generations now living
If , at that time , we had been asked about our willingness to pay another EUR 2
3 billion for it , I am sure that we would have answered with a loud , clear and in@@ stan@@ tane@@ ous ' yes '
The European Union is founded on the applicability of the law , and it is the acknowledgement of the law 's applicability that alone holds it together
So , what we want is not offers of dates for accession , but greater honesty in our relations with Turkey
Mr President , there are just two questions I would like to touch on
I know that Poland has a pain threshold
Nor should the candidate countries fix the measuring ro@@ d so high up that it is no longer possible to jump over it
Secondly , let us look at procedure and the institutional issues , in which the President-in-Office of the Council has described Parliament as having an interest
If it had done that , our situation would be an easier one
Mr Napolitano put forward a few arguments in favour of the procedure being changed at some points , and , much as I respect him , I am not convinced
My personal opinion is that every country , from the first day of membership , is entitled to a Commissioner , even if a Commissioner without portfolio
I take the view that , especially when there are ten new Commissioners , this House must also have the right of at least overall approval
This brings us , of course , to the detailed procedure for the new Parliament
Mr President , I would like to address the major risk I think the Council meeting in Copenhagen may comprise in terms of the EU as a peace project
All of us here are talking about EU unification
We are all talking about the historic decision in Copenhagen
Could the EU as a peace project be destroyed in Copenhagen , however ?
I am sure that many members will feel that this question is not relevant , but I think it is
The EU has been incredibly successful in bringing people and states closer together in the European Union
We now have , however , a candidate country which is first in line to become a member of the European Union , namely Cyprus
Following the fall of the Berlin Wall , Nicosia has been Europe 's divided capital
Following the reunification of Germany , it is Cyprus which is the divided country in Europe
The European Parliament has clearly stated that it would like to see the Turkish occupying forces withdrawn from northern Cyprus
Is this the EU as a peace project ?
This must be investigated in Copenhagen
I would like to see this question investigated
Let us not be blinded by the char@@ m offensive on the part of Turkey
Is this the EU as a peace project ?
Of course we recognise that new Member States have a right to a Commissioner as from day one of their membership of the European Union
Of course it makes sense not to res@@ hu@@ ffle all the portfolios of the existing Commission just for a few months
Under the current Treaty , there are only two ways
One is that every single Member of the current Commission agrees to resign on an agreed date , or this Parliament adopts a motion of censure forcing them to resign
Both scenarios would be a little bit odd unless they were subject to an agreement among the three institutions
That is a sine qua non
I think that is the route the Council should pursue in dialogue with us
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , my problem with Mr Corbett is that he knows too much about the law and so he always plun@@ ges me into confusion
His surfeit of knowledge , though , means that his trains of thought travel by such circu@@ itous routes that the actual message is lost
For the political message is that we want to give the candidates for accession a warm welcome without en@@ tang@@ ling them in bureaucratic min@@ uti@@ ae
That , I believe , is what the message has to be
Whether it be four weeks or four months , the principle remains the same and in@@ dis@@ soluble
let the Commissioners without portfolio come , as agreed , from 1 May onwards
So what is the problem ?
I believe that the way to make headway here is to put this in simple terms
If the new Commission is to be in office by 1 November , then what is decisive is that Parliament 's rights have to be secured
Let me make another , additional comment
I do not think it right that this situation should come about
Ten new countries , that is difficult enough , and then , along come the Turks
I should like to make one brief comment
I indicated that I made it clear that I wanted no definitive decision made on questions of dates and transition without the Parliament being fully involved , engaged and consulted
Mr President , I should like to concur with Mr Brok
I should like to briefly update you on what has been happening in the Netherlands recently
There , we saw a Dutch Liberal leader , Mr Ger@@ rit Z@@ al@@ m , launch a k@@ am@@ ik@@ a@@ ze campaign
He demanded that the Netherlands should thwart enlargement with a view to enforcing agricultural reforms
What we need is the courage to do our homework in the area of agricultural reforms , and this is also necessary to help the dollar round succeed
In that case , we will not have done our homework , which is necessary if the accession countries are to be treated fairly
Mention is made of net and gross accounts between Europe and the enlargement countries too easily without sufficiently acknowledging the necessity of those agricultural reforms
In my view , we have built in too much technocracy and not enough politics this time round
We have learnt that these are political decisions
We should summon up the courage to look our own people in the eye and accept their judgments
The debate confirms that there is massive support for what is happening next week
I would extend my thanks for all the good advice that has been given , on which I shall make a few comments
I should like to thank Mr Poettering for putting the Copenhagen European Council into exactly the right perspective from the outset
Without repeating what he said , it is this historical perspective that we must keep in view the whole time
The thanks given to the Presidency are also due to the Commission , especially Mr Verheugen , who has now been working tirelessly on this for years
I fully agree with Mr Titley
I do not know about ' now or never ' , but in any case it is time for action
Despite the difficult problems that remain , we have come so far that we cannot justify failure
As regards Cyprus , I fully agree with Mr Verheugen
We must do everything we can to ensure that the UN Secretary-General 's endeavours to find a solution ahead of Copenhagen meet with success
Concerning Turkey , the basis is clear
Turkey is a candidate
The accession negotiations can commence when the Copenhagen criteria have been met
They have not been , but Turkey has made impressive progress with the far-reaching reform package
In Copenhagen , a strong and positive signal will be sent to the Turkish politicians and population
The precise form this signal will take is to be discussed in detail by the Heads of State and Government
I agree with Mr Poettering that this is not the main subject for Copenhagen
The ten countries will take centre stage there
We shall not forget the prospect of Turkey , however , neither shall we forget Bulgaria and Romania
These two countries have made tremendous progress in their accession negotiations , but are not ready yet
They will be given a roadmap for the last stretch of the way
My thanks to the many people who have expressed their support for keeping within the expenditure ceilings set out at Berlin and Brussels
I also wish to thank all of those who have said that we should not argue over small amounts at this decisive historic juncture
I must , however , advise against suggestions that we should discuss whether we can add another couple of billions to the amount set out in the ten packages
The art is not to have opinions and make suggestions
We must keep in mind that the art is to reach a consensus , or , in other words , to put the finishing touches to the packages in Copenhagen
This would mean that the MEPs from the new Member States could play a part in approving the Commissioners from their countries
A new election date could help@@ ; and we have tried to arrange this , but without success
The Presidency is willing , but we are afraid that it will not be possible
If this is the case , it is good that we have another solution , one that may not be perfect , but is tolerable for all parties
This is not something I have made up; it is in Article 23 of the Treaty of Nice
In a way , it is bad enough that they have to accept a treaty that we are in the process of amending
Finally , I wish to give my support to something that many have expressed
None of the applicant countries will have to wait for any of the others
If only nine applicant countries are ready , they will join
It is important , therefore , that the applicant countries , too , remember to strike while the iron is hot , or Mr Titley 's prediction might come true
Lastly , I wish to say to the President that the Presidency looks forward to seeing him and the Conference of Presidents in Copenhagen directly before the summit
There we can continue the dialogue we have had all along on these difficult but also rewarding issues that are common to the three institutions
I would now like to say a brief word on the most important topics of the debate
First , I will return to the subject of money
That is precisely the problem
So when their own contributions are deducted there are EUR 9 thousand million net additional payments left
That means no one is a net payer and they are all in a much better position than in 2003
The figure for appropriations , ladies and gentlemen , is really very impressive , I have to say , and the word me@@ ann@@ ess is not appropriate
7 thousand million in appropriations are available for those three years
That is quite something when you look at the size of these countries ' economies
We should not forget that the gross national product of the countries of Eastern and Central Europe is only five per cent of that of the present European Union
These figures are already reasonably balanced , I should say
It is also true , however , that it repeatedly has to be pointed out by both sides that the European Union is not a cash dispens@@ er
You do not put a card , be it a membership card or a credit card , in at the top and get money out at the bottom
The proposal that we put forward was in fact intended precisely to make possible a socially cus@@ hi@@ oned , sensible structural development of agriculture in the new Member States
without this measure there is no chance of winning the referendum in Poland , for example
That is the background to this decision , but I readily admit that it is certainly regrettable from the point of view of a sensible development of agricultural policy
Mr Nassauer spoke to me about it in person
I have nothing different to say about it in private than I have said in public
What was quoted in the newspaper I have said many times , including here in the European Parliament
The problem is , however , that we did not have that option
That option had already been attempted and had already failed and there was no other
That is the outcome of the debate in 15 Member States , so far as the governments are concerned
I am well aware that other views are being taken in public , sometimes even by the majority
But we know that the 15 governments of the Member States are unanimous in the view that we must stick to the Helsinki strategy
In that respect , Mr Giscard d' Estaing 's contribution probably did not have the outcome he wanted
I should just like to make two small points
Naturally , we now needed a working hypothesis for the accessions
Without a date we would have been unable to negotiate the financial chapter , because the date has enormous consequences for the financial situation in the first year of membership
The financial packages for each individual country are quite different , depending on the date taken as a basis for the work
That is why the decision was necessary
So far as I know , it was taken by the Council primarily in the light of the amount of time the Member States said they needed for ratification
That should also be taken into account , as I have often said
Candidate countries and Member States took the view that the new commissioners must be there from the first day of accession
In that case , I think it is sensible to keep this transitional period with 30 commissioners as short as possible
That is why the date of 1 November emerged for the next Commission
That is the minimum amount of time required to appoint a new Commission President , get him approved and also to give him time to put a new Commission together
That is the full background
I think we can discuss it together sensibly and , as I said , the Commission is willing to do so at any time
That concludes the debate
This presupposes more say for the directly elected European Parliament , but also more of a Union in which peoples and regions feel at home
All future Member States have made huge efforts to meet the Copenhagen criteria and to integrate the acquis into their legislation and national fabric@@ s
Turkey cannot demand a date in Copenhagen
It is obvious that Turkey itself has a long way to go before it can meet the Copenhagen criteria
This should not only be evident from its legislation but also be based on reality
The next item is the joint debate on two oral questions ,
we must resolve this issue during this legislature , before it comes to an end , given the political importance it has
What I regret at this point is that it seems that , in seeking the greatest possible agreement , disagreements have been highlighted
As the President is well aware , it was I who proposed the amendment to the de Palacio report which was approved by 4@@ 55 votes
This is what I have done on behalf of the Socialist Group
I do not feel overly influenced by the Germans , it is not true
It is not true , for example , that this system of allowances has been created to compensate the I@@ ber@@ ians
I come from a parliament in which they gave me the ticket , I had never earned more
I was faced with this system and I do not know any parliament , even those which pay most , which has renounced this system
Why do we have to have this hypocritical and cynical argument ?
I believe we have to seek unity and not offend our fellow Members because we have to work together to find a way to move ahead
I am grateful for the letter you have written and I have one hope , Mr President , because I believe that you also take this approach
I hope that today the Council will say that it is prepared to hold talks with us on the methods for approving the Statute
Today , all we have to ask is that the President-in-Office of the Council hold out his hand - not to me but to Parliament
We must do the rest through an open debate and joint work amongst us and , please , let us not increase divisions
Let us seek unity in Parliament because this is our responsibility and we cannot transfer it to others
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we are dealing with a never-ending story here
This House has been considering the Members ' Statute since 1998
I think it is high time we brought it to an end
We are virtually at the end of a legislative period and we also have enlargement ahead of us
I believe the legal position of the Members of this House needs to be settled now once and for all
Of course , we also need an official response from the Council to the proposals made by official bodies of this House
We have been waiting for a response from the Council since April this year and that is why we believe this oral question is now necessary
It is high time
This proposal of Mr Rothley 's is a very balanced one
We were guided by the submissions made by the wise men who were appointed to make concrete proposals to us
We have come to the conclusion that we ought to receive as salary one half of the basic salary of a European judge
I believe everything about this plan is well balanced
There was quite an obvious contradiction between the claims that were fal@@ sely made there this morning and what is actually contained in the resolution
Everything else is virtually identical in content
I therefore fail completely to understand why it was claimed this morning that the large groups would oppose the statute and wanted to fill their pockets
That is certainly not the case and it is improper to say so in that way in this House or at a press conference
I would like to make that very clear at this point
In this House , there is no room for cheap populism
The large groups have a responsibility for this entire House and we are trying to fulfil it
This oral question and this resolution have again been put on the agenda so that we can make progress in the debate about the Statute , not to hinder it
It must be clear by now what the Council wants
What I consider unacceptable is that we should have a repeat of what has already happened with the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies
The contact group met and we were told that if we reached a compromise over taxation the problems would be solved and the Statute could come into force as proposed
We went along with the compromise , one that , incidentally , I consider illegal and that the European Court of Justice will never accept
We went along with it , however , in the interests of a common statute , and what was the outcome ?
The Council again raised other problems and issues and in the end we have made not the slightest progress
That is why this time I would like to see on our desks not only a well-meaning letter from our President , but also a definite statement from the Council
That is the purpose of this oral question and the resolution that accompanies it
The question of the transparency of costs is raised again and again
But it is not the subject of this resolution
I take that as read and that is the subject of all the motions for a resolution that are here on the table
Mr President , I have listened with great attention to the speeches we have already heard
I should like to say that , as has been pointed out , the Council wishes to help find a solution that guarantees the individual Member dignity and public respect
That does not however apply to taxation arrangements
As is well known , the Council has not adopted a position on a number of the central features of the future Statute
In that connection , I should like to emphasise a couple of crucial elements
In conclusion , I would therefore welcome all efforts aimed at a solution acceptable to both the Council and Parliament
I should like , on behalf of the Council , to urge Parliament not to let this opportunity pass by
It is Parliament that is to do the proposing and the Council that is to do the approving
The ball lies in Parliament 's court
Mr President , I have little to add to Mr Lehne 's words because I agree with everything he said
In establishing the Statute , the members are reinforcing that autonomy
Mr Haarder has shown that he is on our side
I have taken note , President-in-Office , that the Council has declared its intention to take what Parliament decides into consideration , over and above questions of majority or unanimity
We tabled the question , which was endorsed by the President-in-Office , in order to give you an even greater chance of finding a solution
I believe that , in adopting this text , Parliament will be increasing this possibility even more
We have made progress
Thank you also for the letter that you sent to Members , which has clarified a lot of things
You were chairman of the Liberal Group at the time
That was a long time ago
We intend the resolution as a spur to deeper discussion with the Council of the questions that remain open
Of course those questions need to be settled
Those who speak only about money betray their deep contempt for this Parliament
We are not a g@@ ang of c@@ on men whose activities have to be stopped
When the European Council introduced direct elections in 1976 , it failed to set out the constitutional rights of Members
The Council cannot , more than two decades after the first direct elections , expect us to go without a definition of Members ' constitutional rights
The rules on immunity date back to 19@@ 65 and were designed for delegates sent to the Parliamentary Assembly by the national parliaments
The Council cannot expect us not to change anything in those 19@@ 65 provisions in the year 2003
I am quite familiar with the legal problems
With a measure of good will on both sides they can be solved
There is a time for everything
I have the feeling that the time for a decision is drawing near
We shall probably deal with the matter for good early next year
We are authorised to submit a report for the plen@@ um
In any case , the Statute must be adopted before enlargement
It will be virtually impossible afterwards
There is no need for us to have this debate today
If the motion proposed by Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Poettering is adopted , it will block progress in our discussions with the Council
Mr Rothley 's opinion wants to include in the Members ' Statute issues of primary law such as imm@@ unities and privileges which require ratification by national parliaments
The message about reform that they are sending to the Council is ' take it or leave it '
The message that they are sending to MEPs who want reform is ' forget it '
Have you no concern for the reputation of this House ?
I am accused in Mr Rothley 's press release of being un@@ serious , of making dishonest accusations
Mr Rothley , I take seriously the accusations of dis@@ honesty made by citizens against us
Mr Barón Crespo accuses me of he@@ ap@@ ing inv@@ ec@@ tive on the socialists
The answer is that you heap inv@@ ec@@ tive on yourselves and you deserve it
Mr President , we abuse the taxpayer at our peril and we de@@ mean democratic politics through not reforming
The Poli@@ tici@@ an 's corp@@ se was borne away ,
It is a major political challenge to resolve this crisis , perhaps the most important political challenge to be tackled in the near future
All our actions must take this objective into consideration
Therefore , in the proposals that will be negotiated with the Council , we must not include provisions that we already know are unacceptable
Otherwise , we might as well be saying that we do not want a statute
I do not intend to insult or offend anyone by saying this , Mr President
To give just two examples , Article 9 of the document claims to guarantee future Members virtual impunity
This is inexcusable , and the article regarding remuneration calls for a huge rise in allowances for most Members
At a time when the Union is advocating austerity measures to be imposed for employees and calling for public spending to be ra@@ tioned , this might sound like a provocation
Tomorrow , each of us will have the opportunity to shoulder our responsibilities
We want a statute to be achieved and all these matters that anno@@ y our citizens so much to be resolved
We cannot approve of a statute that contains possible elements in the form of concealed pay
We want all the money paid to us in the form of salary and expenses to be as transparent as possible and justifiable in the eyes of the public
Neither can we agree to any privileges for ourselves that we cannot extend to our citizens
The means the two largest groups have employed to prevent you , Mr President , from holding discussions with the Council have been totally unacceptable
Tomorrow everyone can decide which side they are on
Articles 1@@ 89 and 190 clearly stipulate that the Members of this House are representatives of the people who elected them
That is why , a long time ago , we put forward a proposal which , we continue to believe , could represent a good compromise
It consists of three parts
Secondly , relocation and other costs should be fully refunded , but within a reasonable limit obviously
Lastly , if necessary , we could , additionally , identify a set allowance paid by the European Parliament for each day of attendance
This would constitute an income - but this time , it would be a clear and transparent income - which could be subject to Community tax
We have thought for a long time that this proposal offers a good compromise between several objectives
During the last three years or so , we have talked a lot but realistically we have achieved much less
These must then be converted into proper legal form in the manner envisaged by the Treaties
Once all the rhetoric is cut out , it is just as simple as that
Mr President , I rather suspect that voters outside this House would have some difficulty understanding what is going on here this afternoon and indeed some of us may
I wonder what the public would make of it
Of course , some will say we do not do an ordinary job of work
Yes , indeed we are special , we are public servants
I have sat in this House now for three years through innumerable discussions on this issue and we seem to move no further forward
What do we have on the table today ?
We have an exercise in sub@@ ter@@ fu@@ ge bogged down in a quagmire of procedure , I would hasten to suggest
On the one hand , we are talking about a report - a report that was not a report , merely an advice - voted by one committee
On the other hand , we are talking about some feedback from yourself , Mr President , for which we are very grateful
But some people here do not even want to mention that
Members have nothing of substance or detail before of them , nothing that they have the right to amend or that they all have the possibility to properly vote on
Instead , we are bogged down in this interminable roun@@ d@@ about of discussion on procedure
But , help is at hand
Let us be clear , there is a very practical paragraph in the joint motion from three parties that would allow a practical process to take off
The very paragraph , of course , that is opposed by majorities within the big groups in this House
That paragraph is tabled individually as an amendment
I would not wish people to become any more confused than we already are
I once presented a youth petition for a referendum for service and justice and against privilege
The cause of our problem actually lies in the fact that , although we have all been elected to this House , we are not treated equally
Part of our problem is that we have 15 national electoral laws and no European electoral law , that we do not have one incompatibility rule but several different ones
That is one problem
We have already discussed this topic in 1998 , 1999 and in April 2001
Today again we get no answer from the Council - because that was no answer
I therefore ask myself how close we are to the destination if we cannot clearly say what the outstanding points are
No national mandate can be compared with the mandate in the European Parliament
The time involved is greater , the distance is greater and we have less time at home than any of our counterparts
We have a decision from the Committee for Legal Affairs and the Internal Market which forms the basis for the President 's talks
We have a group of experts that has come to a conclusion so that no one can say we are arranging things to our own liking
We have the Rothley report and we have the legal situation where we adopt our statute and the Council approves it so it can enter into force
With this question we wanted greater transparency instead of rumours , greater clarity instead of recriminations
We wanted the Council 's answer , which sadly was no answer , to bring us a step closer to the decision we need
Nor do we want to be mess@@ ed about by political opportun@@ ists or the Council 's in@@ decision
I say to you , if we do not take ourselves seriously , no one else will
We must therefore resist opportunism and single-mindedly go the way we in this Parliament have decided on the basis of the law
Mr President , I have to describe Mr Karas 's speech as meaningless
The answer is yes
Moreover , I repeated what the Council has said all the time , namely that the ball is now in Parliament 's court
Now Parliament has agreed on something there are prospects of the Council 's adopting and approving , I assume that the ball will be passed on to the Council
I shall not go into details concerning the statement by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to Parliament 's Conference of Presidents
That statement has not of course been sent to the Council , and it has not been adopted by a majority in Parliament
The Council will not submit a detailed proposal
That is an answer for Mr Lehne
The ball is in Parliament 's court
I should like to remind you of the events of 1999 , when the then German Presidency made a great effort to arrive at a compromise
That is something I believe the present rapporteur can remember , so we do not need to repeat it
There must be clarity regarding the reimbursement of ex@@ pens@@ es; there must be an appropriate salary level; and travel expenses must be calculated on the basis of documentation
That is what the Council has emphasised all the time
We must have this Statute in place in good time for the next elections to the European Parliament
It is bad if the electorate treat this Parliament with indifference
There are unfortunately too many people who do just that
This can be seen from the fact that they do not turn up and vote
The Council has of course given clear signals
It must be possible for these things to be done , Mr President
It lies in your hands and in those of your MEPs
That concludes the joint debate
I have received five motions for resolutions to wind up the debate
Mr President , there is something I need to get off my chest
On Sunday , I expressed my solidarity with the Galician people by attending the demonstration in Santiago de Com@@ post@@ el@@ a
'@@ N@@ un@@ ca ma@@ is ' was their slogan , and I should like to repeat it here
Galicia lives by the sea , and the sea was destroyed by merchant criminals who sail along the coast in old tankers full of oil
They are nothing more than environmental criminals who allow lea@@ king tankers to be towed into the high seas
I would also urge everyone to see this apo@@ c@@ aly@@ ptic scene for themselves , as the reality is much worse than the television foot@@ age
Please let this be Europe 's last oil disaster
The Council must now take decisive action
Mr President , the Prestige disaster in Galicia has the consequences of a natural disaster , but in truth it is a political disaster
Mr President , I would just like to express my profound sympathy with what Mr Nogueira Román has said
We , in Scotland , recently in the case the Bra@@ er disaster suffered a similar misfortune
But that is not what I wanted to speak about tonight
I would like to mention the currently hot issue about access to the Court of Justice , especially rights of semi-@@ privileged access in the case of regions with legislative powers
The Committee on Constitutional Affairs discussed that last week and it will come before us in a fortnight 's time as a hotly controversial point
Tonight 's debate on fisheries brings up an interesting example which shows what the reality of the issue is
There are big risks for Scottish fisheries of the kind which Mr Nogueira in a different sense has alluded to
It could be that we want to raise an issue about the legality of current proposals under the primary law relating to the accession of Spain and Portugal
Only if we get appropriate rights of access to the courts will that sort of question be answered in the proper place
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to express my solidarity , as a Portuguese citizen , with our neighbours in Galicia who have suffered this tragedy
This is an enormous disaster and it is to be welcomed that Europe has , for once , learnt its lesson
It seems that the Erika was not enough but the Prestige must be enough for this type of thing never to happen again
It is extremely important that Parliament sends this forceful signal and I therefore fully support the words of Mr Nogueira Román
Ladies and gentlemen , there is no need to over-@@ dra@@ ma@@ ti@@ se; the situation itself is dramatic enough
I believe that makes today 's debate crucial for the future of the fishing industry
We are debating several questions and several reports at once
I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs , and also the person who tabled the question , for the reports because they give us an overall view
I would like to divide my contribution into two parts
I would , however , like to say a word about the Prestige disaster , ladies and gentlemen
It is a complete mis@@ nom@@ er that this ship should be called Prestige
The consequences for fishermen , for mussel and oyster farmers , are indeed colossal and dramatic
The Commission has therefore set up a task force
It has already been to Galicia and has spoken with the people affected on the ground and with the authorities there
I believe the IS@@ IS reports were the most recent evidence of the dire straits our fishing industry is in
As you know , in October IS@@ IS published the news that four of the Community 's cod stocks are close to collapse
Fishing for had@@ dock and wh@@ iting should also be suspended because too many cod are caught with them
Reducing cod catches in the last few years has not been enough and unfortunately we now find that quota reductions have resulted in false returns being made and illegal fishing
The scientists have also pointed this out
It is not just an assumption by the Commission as many have claimed
The scientists say - they said so back in 1990 - we recommend that the fishing effort be limited because TACs alone cannot control fish mortality
Twelve years later , ladies and gentlemen , we have still not put that recommendation into practice
In its opinion , that is the only way to do the one and avoid a moratorium
As you know , the Commission proposed a year ago that the fishing effort be limited as part of a recovery plan for cod and hake
To this day the Council has taken no decision on it , and the situation has got worse in the meantime
Parliament , however , gave its opinion on this recovery plan on 13 June this year
In view of this situation , the Commission has been weighing the various options that are available
Now , how is this different from last year 's plan ?
Those are only some of the catches of course
Secondly , we propose a simplified system for the fishing effort , where we want to operate the effort not for each individual ship but for a group of ships
Thirdly , we have tightened up our proposal concerning controls
Member States will have to notify the Commission of the fishing effort on a monthly basis and ships must notify the controlling authorities when they change fishing zones
I am also willing to fund further research work to help us find even better ways to rescue this fishery
That cannot , however , mean , ladies and gentlemen , postponing the necessary measures again
Our aim is to take a decision on this improved recovery plan together with the fisheries reform in December
What does this all mean for our fishermen ?
I am aware that it means great hardship at first , unfortunately , I have to say , great hardship for those concerned
I am very much aware that livelihoods are at stake here
That is why we must not abandon the fishermen in this difficult situation
We have therefore also submitted a corresponding action plan in order to cus@@ h@@ ion some of the possible negative socio-economic consequences
I would like to pick out just three of those measures
Firstly , Member States are urged to adjust their structural programmes and provide additional resources for the fishing industry and areas dependent on fishing
Secondly , Member States can introduce targeted measures for small-scale , employ@@ ment-@@ intensive coastal fishing
Thirdly , it is essential that the economies of the coastal regions be diversified
Ladies and gentlemen , I turn now to the other topics on the agenda today , firstly and in particular Mr Jové 's report
Our proposal in this connection is a new basic regulation for the common fisheries policy as the cornerstone of the reform
Firstly , we want in future to manage stocks on a multi-annual basis
Applying an annual principle to fish is not consistent with fish bio@@ log@@ y; instead , we must make the biological cycles of our fish stocks the essence of our policy
To make management consistent , for those stocks where it is sensible to do so we want to manage the fishing effort as well as TACs and quotas
Note that I say where it is sensible to do so
That means not everywhere , and it depends primarily on the state of the stocks
Secondly , we propose a new fleet policy
The ultimate objectives of the so-called M@@ AP@@ 4 are to be the starting point for the upper limit
This upper limit can only change in one direction , namely a reduction in fleet size
Whenever a fisherman has his ship scrapped using public funds , the upper limit is reduced by the tonnage in question
This means we also need a system to define the ratio by which new vessels can be exchanged for old ones , provided that is done with private funds
Thirdly , we propose closer surveillance of fisheries
Member States will have to coordinate their control activities and Member States ' inspectors will be able to make controls across borders
Satellite surveillance will gradually be extended to smaller vessels , and finally there will also be greater powers for the Commission concerning controls in the Member States
Fourthly , we want the fishing industry to be more closely involved in decision-making in the regional advisory councils
First , there is something I would like to make clear
That is the legal consequence of the Council 's decision of December last year
This policy involves three specific measures
Firstly , we propose retaining those public aids that serve to improve safety , working conditions and hygiene on board
Secondly , we want no more aids for modernisation or the building of new ships
Are we taking a social attitude if we continue to ignore that or pretend it is not a problem ?
Thirdly , we propose that the aids paid up until now for the export of ships and for joint ventures should in future be used to reduce overcapacity
This brings me to the final proposal , namely the emergency measures for scrapping
We propose setting up a scrapping fund
That is an emergency measure
The fund will add the resources for scrapping that are yet to be re@@ programmed to the resources already provided in the structural fund for fisheries
These resources and the new fund will guarantee financial support for laying up fishing vessels
There are two main elements to this
We are also willing to talk if further resources are needed to help the fishermen who want it
Then we shall also have to find a way to do it
Mr President , I hope not to take up my five minutes , but I am not very good at controlling myself in this regard
We are dealing with a proposal which presents various problems - several in my opinion - in terms of the lack of compatibility with the Treaties and elements of legislation
It is true that fish populations are experiencing difficulties and that it is necessary to adopt urgent measures
But it does not make any sense to talk about sustainable development , if we dissociate the two words
Its approach therefore , in my view , implies a greater social impact on populations dependent on fishing , which may lead to far-reaching structural changes
Effectively , only the larger scale sections of the fleet would survive and the small-scale fleet , which generates most employment , would be heading for extinction
Therefore , the management and the recovery of stocks should take account of the social and economic impact of recovery plans
Only in this way , by adapting the speed of recovery of fish stocks , can we mod@@ ulate and minimise the impact on the populations dependent on fishing
In some respects the Commission 's proposal implies a de-@@ communitisation of the fisheries policy , or at least that is how it appears to me
The Commission has presented two difficult , complex and very restrictive proposals on , for example , cod fishing
I will take this opportunity to make the following very personal comment , which is perhaps my observation on what I have heard during this debate
It is clear that there is a reduction in stocks going on
I will not comment on other Commission aspects
Our heart is with them at this time
I want to speak about the cod crisis
I have seen the revised cod and hake recovery plan from the Commission
And of course , parts of the Irish Sea have been closed for cod fisheries for the last three years , enabling cod stocks to recover
As we know in the Committee on Fisheries , 10 years ago the Canadian government closed the New@@ found@@ land Banks and there is no sign yet of the cod returning there
I think a similar pattern is now emerging in the North Sea , where we are seeing large burgeoning populations of prawns , now one of our richest fisheries
Scientists have recently revealed that , just as the cod fish will eat prawns , prawns eat cod lar@@ va@@ e
It may well be that , whatever draconian measures we take , we will fail to re-establish the cod
That is the kind of catastrophe they face this Christmas after faithfully adhering to the rules and regulations of the Common Fisheries Policy for the past twenty years
Mr President , the framework regulation on reforming the CFP does not yet cover the financial implications of the reform for the Community budget
These implications are to be presented in separate proposals and the Committee on Budgets will therefore examine them thoroughly at the appropriate time
I would like to ask the Commission to clarify one point with regard to improving scientific advice
At the same time , we see that the Commission has increased this sum by EUR three million in comparison with last year
This amount , in addition to the EUR one million in reserve , could represent a general increase of EUR four million , as laid down in the framework Regulation
And in the latter case , what does the Commission intend to do with the EUR three million increase in the B@@ -@@ II 9@@ 0@@ 4 heading ?
The draft Regulation stipulates an initial sum of EUR 32 million for 2003 , as a special incentive for cofinancing
It also calcul@@ ates the total additional sums required during the 2003-2006 period to be EUR 2@@ 71
This does not just apply to cod and white fish
All the scientists are afraid that we are fishing most of our fish species to extinction
We have to remember that , without fish , there would be no fishermen , there would be no economy and there would be no fisheries policy
We cannot continue fishing in this way , however
We bear responsibility not only for those living today but also for the future of our children and our grandchildren
What are our plans for sustainability ?
What readiness is there to help the poor coastal fishermen on Africa 's coastline ?
Do we have the right to behave as colon@@ ially as we are actually doing when it comes to fishing agreements with developing countries ?
There are a lot of pretty words on paper , but what does it look like in reality ?
We have fished ourselves into a catastrophe
For God 's sake , do not let us also fish the poor to the brink of catastrophe too
The largest reserve of fish and shellfish in Europe - and possibly even the world - is being ruined by an accident which we all had a duty to prevent
The scale of the tragedy we are facing is as yet unknown
The entire Galician coast , one thousand kilometres , is closed to fishing and shell@@ fish-@@ gathering
S@@ cen@@ ery of unique beauty , national parks , the Natura 2000 network , the entire marine ecosystem and our great wealth of biodiversity have all been ruined
We are facing a European problem , which requires a European solution
We feel impo@@ tent in the face of this situation , and we are asking Europe and the Member States for help
Help us , help the Galic@@ ians
Last summer , when we saw the powerful State of Germany literally flooded by its over@@ flowing rivers , we all joined forces to create a European Solidarity Fund
Here today , in the European Parliament , we are asking for this Fund to be mobilised as a matter of urgency in order to help Galicia
This is no time for legal ped@@ an@@ tr@@ y; we must mobilise the Fund
Europe will become a reality when it is sensitive to the problems faced by its citizens
Let us all start working together , side by side
We have created a European Maritime Safety Agency and we do not know where it should be located
Which European region is most vulnerable to maritime accidents ?
Which region has suffered the most accidents ?
Which region has the greatest natural fish and shellfish resources , that must be protected ?
Which region is most dependent on these resources ?
Which region could be the most aware and most motivated to welcome and work towards maritime safety ?
We in Europe must leave behind politics with a small ` p ' and pointless discussions
Europe owes Galicia a debt
Galicia is the answer to these questions and Galicia must be the proposed location
We are un@@ as@@ ha@@ me@@ dly promoting our shipbuilding industry and constructing double-hulled oil tankers that will ply the seas more safely , following the example of the United States
We are creating maritime corridors for dangerous goods , as France and Spain have already proposed
What we should do urgently and immediately is help those who have lost their livelihood and restore the environment
We should therefore make aid from all the Structural Funds more flexible and mobilise the Solidarity Fund
In the short term , however , we also need measures such as those that I have just mentioned
Let us now talk about fisheries reform
What we need to scrap , Commissioner , are not fishing boats , but old oil tankers
The Prestige has caused more damage to fishing than the entire European fishing fleet put together
When will we assess the damage caused to fishing by other activities ?
Do you not know that the most serious problem is fishing in breeding areas ?
Both large and small boats can do that , and small boats may even be more likely to do so
Are you forgetting the agricultural surplus ?
And yet , we have a deficit of fisheries products
The fisheries sector is not asking for more money , but only the amounts that were promised , under the promised conditions
In 2004 or 2005 , we will have to reform the Structural Funds
We shall see then whether all aid must be stopped
We must analyse the matter
With every boat we scrap , we are destroying jobs , and this must be taken into account
That is the promotion of ship exports and the creation of joint enterprises
I have therefore accepted my fellow Members ' amendments , which enrich my reports , in order to provide increased monitoring and greater transparency in fleet policy
I would now just like , therefore , to thank all the Members who have worked on this matter and tabled amendments , for their cooperation
Lastly , I would like to express my solidarity , naturally , with Mr Stevenson , over his oral question
I would also like to reiterate all the requests made by the rapporteur , Mr Varela
I believe the three aspects are inextricably linked as parts of a whole
The proposal on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy must be based on and committed to sustainable development and environmental protection
Both ideas are starting points , hinges , upon which the construction of CFP reform rests
One example would be the mechanism of temporary cessation of activity , restriction of fishing days , etc
' the European Fisheries Commissioner says that cutting off aid would mitigate job losses
The removal of state aid for the modernisation of boats will be positive , as it will contribute to maintaining jobs on-board boats '
Their dignity requires it and society , in particular the fisheries sector , has requested and expects this
For the first time , you have recognised that your staff can do something for my region
I hope they have told you that our coastline is incredibly rich in biodiversity and that this biodiversity is not Galician , Commissioner , but European
We are now rich in oil and the lack of action by our leaders has struck a g@@ lan@@ cing blow to what we love most , our way of living
The twenty thousand people who live from fishing in Galicia do not understand you very well
I have tried extremely hard to explain your proposals , trying to find common ground between you and my fellow countrymen
Now it is your turn , Mr Fischler
Is it not time , Mr Fischler , for European fishermen in Galicia to hear more than just bad news from their Commissioner ?
The European citizens of Galicia would like to receive exactly the same treatment
I cannot believe that , after a month of disaster , all you can say to us is that you have sent a task force
I am not going to suggest visits , although I do not think it would do any harm if you were to go to Galicia
T@@ our operators are starting to think , as a way out , of offering disaster tourism , as we in Galicia are very fond of black humour
All this , Commissioner , is Galician black humour , but it is also tra@@ gi@@ -@@ com@@ edy
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to thank both rapporteurs for the great job of work they have done
The reforms of our fisheries policy that we are debating this evening are very important
In particular , Mr Varela 's reports on public aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet are very important
On behalf of my group , I would at the same time express understanding for Mr Varela 's statement concerning oil pollution along the Galician coast
We might well have been able to endorse maintaining public aid for the modernisation of fishing vessels if this would exclusively have improved safety and working conditions on board
We could also discuss aid for renewal if we were to make the aid conditional upon more capacity 's being withdrawn than added
One of the biggest problems for the European fishing industry is , specifically , that the fleet is too big
With regard to the proposed ban on cod fishing , we in the ELDR Group would like to support the conservation arrangements
Research must therefore be accorded high priority , and sufficient resources must be made available
Everyone agrees that current fisheries policy has proved to be a failure
That is why it is absolutely crucial for us to support the Commission 's proposals for reform and thus to reject the tabled amendments aimed at perpetuating current fisheries policy
I would remind you that one proposal which we tabled previously has already been adopted here , calling for this derogation to be extended to 24 nautical miles
At least the permanent nature of 12 miles should not now be called into question
The adoption of the proposal that we tabled to extend this derogation to 50 miles in the outermost regions under the terms of their special status is also extremely positive
It must be said , Commissioner , that in certain regions , what causes the greatest destruction of fish stocks is not fishing , but pollution
Even prohibition , in some cases , for vessels less than 12 metres long , although positive , is extremely limited
I also regret the fact that the specific programme for small-scale coastal fishing has not been adopted
We also feel that it is the Member States ' responsibility to guarantee the effective monitoring , inspection and implementation of the rules laid down in the common fisheries policy
We therefore disagree with the proposals intended to undermine this principle
Our fisheries policy must be understood and not just perceived as something being arbitrarily handed down by a European Union which claims to know better but cannot really prove it
Certainly the CFP to date has not exactly been a resounding success , as we have all acknowledged
Their efforts have borne at least some fruit in that the improvement of stocks of cod is only approximately 3 % short of the target set by recovery plans
I think the Commission must take into account the specific nature of this cod crisis and not tie its hands with political deadlines
The forthcoming December Council will be the forum for finalising reform proposals and it should not be used for rushing through panic measures for cod and associated species
I urge the Commission to transform its words into real action
In that way , faith could be restored in the process at the same time
I call on the Commission to think again too when it comes to open access to the North Sea as part of a future CFP
The present crisis only underlines the fragility of that sea and the key stocks in its mixed fishery
I broadly welcome the Jové Peres report in its present form
The Commission proposal is based on the principle of sustainable development and the poor state of fishery resources
The starting point is indisputable but many views , including my own , differ as to the quanti@@ fication of the state of stocks
The basis of the proposal is that account is taken exclusively of scientific reports as regards management measures
However , no credible measures are proposed to improve scientific knowledge even though the shortcomings in this area are well recognised
They envisage a common fisheries policy which is geared more to the short-term interests of some Member States than to fishermen
I say to the Commission that the CFP must be geared towards keeping alive regions which depend on fishing rather than making it a battle@@ field between Member States
They all need fishery resources to carry out their activities
Decisions and objectives of the recovery plans cannot discard the social and economic consequences which they may have
Rec@@ o@@ very plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry
The basic objective of the 6 to 12 miles coastal zone regime was to protect fishery resources by reserving access to small scale coastal fishery activities
In general , this puts less pressure on stocks in these zones which often harbour nur@@ series in juveniles
It also contributed to protecting the traditional fishing activities of coastal communities , thereby helping to maintain their economic and social fabric
I ask you to support my amendments to extend the exclusive coastal fishing zone to 24 miles
I have no doubt that the greater majority of your fishermen would ask you to do the same thing
Because I regret the present unsatisfactory state of fish stocks and because I am in favour of conservation , I am adamant that highly sensitive areas must be protected
The Irish box is one such area of very great sensitivity
Wat@@ ers in this zone are important spawning grounds , which is why there has been a derogation from free access in these waters
Regrettably , this did not prevent the illegal plunder of stocks in the Irish box over the years by some Community fishermen flying flags of convenience
This plunder must stop
These waters must be protected
Existing arrangements for access to the Irish box must be retained permanently in the reform process
There is no bureaucratic replacement for the knowledge and experience of fishermen
For this reason , and for many years , my group has been calling for a greater involvement of fishermen in the ways the common fishery policy is run
If these councils are to play a meaningful role in the future , fishermen must be involved in all phases of the management process
Fishermen must also be more involved in the work of scientists in order to establish mutual confidence
Only in this way can fishermen contribute to and influence Community policy
I congratulate Mr Varela for both of his balanced reports
I agree with his analysis
I agree with his criticism
I agree with his proposed changes to the Commission 's proposals
I will be supporting his reports
It is about their families and their families ' future
It is about their way of life , the only one possible in many areas
Mr President , the Souchet report , which we recently adopted by a very broad majority , has already strongly recommended maintaining state aid for the modernisation of fishing fleets
The conclusions of the Varela report are heading in the same direction and this we welcome
Aid for modernisation is still needed and does not in itself contribute to overfishing
By using a modern and suitably equipped fleet and using more selective and controlled fishing methods , we will encourage the sustainable management of resources and combat fraud
It therefore has a crucial role
I have one last comment to make
If we introduce stricter legislation in the area of fisheries , will consumer demand lessen or , on the other hand , will imports from third countries increase further ?
How can we avoid this pernicious effect ?
We would like answers to all these questions
Mr President , someone said earlier that shri@@ m@@ ps are netting a much higher income than cod
Does that mean that cod will be off the menu in future , as is apparently already the case in New@@ found@@ land ?
That reminds me of a joke
Why do we need cod when we have fish fingers ?
But seriously , we have been preparing for this reform on 1 January 2003 for years now and just what has the European Parliament delivered in the end ?
And I think that the House has given birth not to a reform but at best a mini-@@ reform
Oh well , be that as it may ?
Instead of safeguarding long-term fish stocks , short-term , short-sighted maintenance of the status quo is the order of the day
Har@@ sh words , but I stand by them
Hardly the real reform everyone supposedly wanted
We have too many vessels chasing fewer and fewer fish , with some stocks in a state of total collapse
You cannot ignore the facts , even if you think it might lose you your seat
Do you really believe that people do not see through politicians ?
I cannot continue to support public aid for new vessels with a clear conscience knowing that we simply have too many vessels
If building new vessels were a profitable business with good profit forecasts , surely the banks would be queuing up to hand out money ?
They are not queuing up , there are no good profit forecasts and yet we expect European taxpayers to step in , whether they want to or not
And there will not be any profit forecasts unless we rethink and make radical cutbacks
One of the most important reasons is that stocks of several species are at a critical level
There are too few fish for too many fishing vessels and the proposed regulations need to be judged in this context
Parliament needs to pl@@ uck up courage and stand firm if it is serious about protecting fish stocks
Unfortunately , no thread of real reform runs through Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna 's reports
Nor do I totally agree that we should call the voluntary scrapping measures proposed by the Commission into question
The emphasis here is on volun@@ tar@@ y; to me , everything else is just talk
As far as I am concerned , neither report is acceptable as it stands and I cannot vote for them
The fact that all the proposed measures need a soft social and economic landing is one of our main demands and I think we all now agree on that
But today 's debate is about the proposed reforms , not the loss of the Prestige and we must not confuse the two
We stand by the Galician fishermen but we must keep our eye on the ball
Mr President , we need to ensure the viability of the sector that is vital for employment and economic and social cohesion in the Union 's coastal areas
We need to maintain sustainable marine ecosystems conserving fish stocks for future generations
Parliament 's resolution the green paper identified the fundamental aim of the CFP as attaining a balance between the two
ELDR amendments to the Jové Peres report seek to ensure the long-term future of the 12 mile limit and of relative stability
These are essential both to the sustainability of fragile coastal communities and of the stocks on which they depend
We aim to specify more clearly the other measures that need to taken to protect stocks
We would ren@@ ame regional advisory councils as regional management councils
This makes it clear that such councils should have a real role in helping to formulate and to implement the measures needed under the reformed CFP
In particular , we must use these councils to help achieve the fullest possible understanding of the functioning of marine ecosystems
For example , recent research suggests that an increase rather than a decrease in ne@@ ph@@ ro@@ ps quotas could actually be positive for the regeneration of cod stocks
Finally , balancing the viability of the sector and the sustainability of stocks is not just a matter for the reform of the CFP
It is precisely what is required in the current cod crisis
It is good that the Commission has addressed the socio-economic problems but the measures so far seem like prescribing a couple of aspir@@ ins to cure a severe case of p@@ ne@@ um@@ onia
So we are formally in support of the resolution
Let us hope that a proper implementation of CFP reform will prevent any such crises arising in the future
It is up to the Member States to decide on their plan of action during this time
I would like to make a plea for small-scale fishing , which affects the most jobs and enables many families of traditional fishermen to survive
We would like more money to be granted to businesses , particularly from the Structural Funds
This money must also be used to buy better equipment , not to destroy boats
We should also , for example , give small , less powerful boats access to reserved areas to be used as their main resource
For example , aid can be given to fisheries and to fish auctions
As regards the representation of fishermen in Commission advisory councils , we must encourage small businesses
We should increase the representation of traditional fishermen , particularly within regional fishing committees , in which professional associations can express their views
The industrial tribunals in the Mediterranean are a good example of this
They could thus defend their interests more forcefully
They contribute to the depletion of stocks , which is harmful for both local fishermen and fishermen all over the world
These are some proposals , therefore , that we can make to encourage small-scale fishing
Mr President , what has been agreed to in relation to cod fishing in the Irish Sea will discriminate drastically against the Northern Ireland fleet
More sacrifices have been made by that fleet than any other fleet in the European Union
Northern Ireland fishermen more than anyone want to maintain sustainable fisheries in the Irish Sea
Cod amounts to about 10 % of the value of all fish annually landed in Northern Ireland
Northern Ireland fishermen are opposed to the present proposals
further targeted decommission@@ ing; real-@@ time clo@@ su@@ res; additional technical conservation measures
Fishermen want to work with the scientists but the scientists who advise the Commission will not work with them
I have been at a meeting where they invited the scientists to come and look at the Irish Sea and the scientists would not even come and look at it
They prepared a boat for them and they would not even go out in the boat
I say that if the scientists cannot go and argue their case in the Irish Sea then it must not be a scientific case that they are really arguing
The chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has a proposal that would secure more money for investigating the effects of the measures already in place
That is something that is very important
Fe@@ ars of discrimination are not myths in Northern Ireland , they are stubborn facts
We need to have a real evaluation of what success the past cuts have had and what information is available to be examined
Northern Ireland fishermen have made great sacrifices in the past but they are now being convinced that the knife has been turned on them
For example , we have had an announcement from Dublin that there are going to be bigger , larger and better boats
There is going to be an Atlantic dream financed partly by EU aid while the fishermen in Northern Ireland are being pushed to destroy their own boats
I do , however , have some observations to make
Even then , some jur@@ ists added that this also implied the freedom to fish , which could also lead to the depletion of stocks
As you see , this is an age-old problem
In other words , the freedom to fish must be conditional on the marine resources available
Protecting marine resources is not only about guaranteeing the future of fishing but also concerns a biological value , an essential value of humanity and of life on Earth
Mr President , I would like to devote my speech to the cod crisis
However , we have not always done this in the past
By way of comparison , there was a shortage of cod in the 1960s , followed by a huge surplus in the North Sea in the Seven@@ ties
To this day , nobody can explain why that was
We do not know enough , and certainly not everything there is to know , about cod
During 2000 - 2001 , cutbacks by 40 % were imposed , which was very drastic
The effects of such a measure have left the sector with little resilience to take any further knock@@ -@@ backs
The sector is under pressure and we are expected to take a careful approach
We should not consider last year 's reserves as an op@@ tion; these had a negative impact on cod stocks
This is an example of hasty , rather than careful , decision-making , with a negative result
We cannot sell this to the people who work in the fishing industry
We cannot simply discontinue cod fishing
We can certainly not pass on the problem to the flat@@ fish sector , since cod is caught in that sector as a secondary line
Neither flat@@ fish stocks , nor cod stocks would justify this
We are not simply talking about fish stocks , but also about the socio-economic implications of another major intervention
We should , therefore , think carefully and take informed decisions
I am thus pleased with Mr Stevenson 's resolution
We should think of alternatives , think in terms of cutting the link with flat@@ fish , and consider setting up a compensation fund
Why , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , must CFP reform take place specifically in 2002 ?
It is taking place because a transitional period has just come to an end in Spain and Portugal
Since 1986 , Spain and Portugal have not enjoyed rights equal to those of the other States over the seas that belong to us all , as Community seas
This fact does not appear anywhere , however; it does appear in the Commission document , but Parliament has rejected it
We must not uphold privileges and discrimination that allows these States still to be considered as intruders in seas that belong to us all
Having said this , we are now seeing enormous confusion
Pri@@ v@@ ile@@ ges are being confused with the conservation of resources
In order to justify the privileges it is said that we want to conserve resources
This principle is not being applied
Maintaining - I am just finishing , Mr President - the principle of relative stability , scor@@ ning international fishing , failing to take into account that ?
Against this backdrop , some fundamental criticism must be made of the Commission proposals
In their current wording , these proposals are unacceptable
Our first criticism is that ending aid for fleet modernisation is totally unacceptable
To conclude , Commissioner , I should also like to say that other issues have not been given due consideration
if a stock preservation programme exists , why are we continuing to allow fishing for the manufacture of fishmeal to take place ?
Also , why is it that no specific measures have been envisaged for the outermost regions , whose aquatic ecosystems are highly sensitive ?
In this regard it is crucial that a specific solution is found for these outermost regions which , in Portugal 's case , are Madeira and the Azores
Mr President , I would like to concentrate on the cod crisis
I am glad that the Commission has moved away from an all-out moratorium
They are fighting for the future of Scottish fisheries and the final decision ultimately rests at their doors , not ours
However , we have to consider what kind of future we want
' so@@ d the cod and allow fishing to continue and just hope for the best
The other stocks will not go the same way as the cod ' ?
Or , do we want to work through , in a cooperative manner , with industry , ministers and other organisations to seek a common solution ?
Whatever solution is agreed , change is inevitable
At present there is no specific UK@@ /@@ Scottish counter-@@ proposal to what the Commission is proposing
However , doing nothing in the light of declining cod stocks is not an option
The difficult task of reaching a quota figure that is sustainable yet scientifically credible remains
The next two weeks will be critical to finding a solution to this crisis
Mr President , my speech also concerns the cod fishing crisis
They demand a total ban
Are we listening to their advice and suggestions ?
No , we are trying to find all manner of arguments for avoiding taking our responsibility
Sweden has decided , however , that a unilateral fishing ban on cod will apply , for we are living by the precautionary principle
If we do not do this , it might mean the complete destruction of the future of the fishing industry
does the Commission fully support the Swedish unilateral fishing ban ?
Can Commissioner Fischler repeat what he said when he was in Sweden recently , to the effect that he also supports compensation for fishermen ?
There is something I really do fail to understand , however , Commissioner
Parliament is on your side
We even agree on providing incentives for scrapping and , therefore , encouraging some fishermen to leave the fisheries sector
I genuinely fail to understand , however , why it is that we cannot succeed in coming to an agreement
Then the other point is the reliability of the scientific data , which we have mentioned several times
Now , I do not believe that an agreement cannot be reached between Parliament and the Commission , given that our goals are the same
consider the political implications if we were to fail in this matter
We are on the eve of redefining the Europe we want , and we want it to be more intergovernmental and more Community-@@ based
Commissioner , how can we convince you to restore state aid ?
You are as stubborn on this issue as a deep-sea fisherman
You have conceded a small amount of ground for vessels less than 12 metres long , which is positive
In my view , however , it is not because the money is public money that fish are disappearing
An old boat , however , is a dangerous boat
An old traw@@ ler is as dangerous as an old oil tanker
Here are the statistics from France , which were published a few weeks ago
According to the ' Ac@@ ci@@ dent Investig@@ ation ' Bureau , there have been 30 shipwrecks and 22 people have died
What sort of boats are involved , however ?
All of them were more than 30 years old - that is obvious
You want to find a solution without increasing capacity
Small@@ -scale fishing has no proper funding and so , without a boost from the state , nothing will change
Mr President , I should first of all like to express my solidarity with the Galician people and with the MEPs who hail from that region
In the light of recent events , it is only right and proper that the European Union , and also the Commission , should express solidarity
I note that the Commissioner has , in fact , taken the bull by the horns with regard to what is wrong with the fish stocks
It is true that , as far as cod is concerned , something is amiss
It is also true that cod may well be found in other locations , but the fact is that cod levels in the North Sea are at an all-time low
However , we should also be careful , if we want to adopt a fair and sound administration in Europe , not to throw out the baby with the bath@@ water
We should look at the situation fairly and consider the underlying causes
There is , of course , the warming of sea water to some extent , but we should also examine the probable causes of overfishing in the first place
Why was quota control not in place ?
Let us mainly focus on these issues
I should now like to turn to the next topic
Sound quota management in that very sector has meant that , relatively speaking , this sector is doing well , certainly taking into consideration the drastic cutbacks in additional catches
I should also add that over the space of ten years , cod catches from the Netherlands have decreased by 70 %
It is unacceptable for fishermen to have to suffer extra for sole and pla@@ ice
We need the multiannual management plans proposed by the Commissioner , based upon scientific advice and to be applied to all the stocks
We must get away from the annual quota lot@@ teries and the emergency crisis resolution that takes place every single year
The collapse of cod stocks in the North Sea , Irish Sea and Sk@@ ag@@ er@@ ra@@ k is , in reality , a judgment upon fisheries policy so far
We must not , however , use the subsidies for renewing and converting the fishing fleet
Moreover , we need to establish much more efficient common supervision of fisheries
On that point , the Commissioner should know that aid will be required
I cannot endorse Mr Varela 's reports
I think that they are both on the wrong track
Like the rapporteur , I acknowledge that the Commission proposal is largely unacceptable
I would point out that there are other measures that are not irreversible and which will cause less upset in achieving a balance between fleet capacity and available fish resources
Portugal is becoming increasingly concerned to see the Commission ignoring this situation , rejecting inspections and continuing blindly to ask all Member States to make the same sacrifices
As the rapporteur quite rightly said , this Commission proposal appears , more than anything , to be a leap in the dark
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank you for the very extensive debate we have had here
We need to do more here and I am in the process of doing something about this
I shall be ben@@ ding the rules as far as I possibly can without actually breaking them
We are also prepared to look , with the Spanish Government , at how we can put structural resources for fisheries to the best possible use here
We want the compensation ruling to be flexible enough to include joint activities undertaken by groups or organisations in the fisheries sector
It is not up to the Commission to take the decisions here; this is a decision for the Council
I really must categorically reject what Mr Stevenson said about everything being based on out-of-date data and hence not being very relevant
To say this was an academic exercise which , if you want , you can ignore , is totally uncalled for
For the most part , catch data for 2001 were used
If 2001 brought about such dramatic results , then it is obvious from stock patterns that 2002 will bring about even more dramatic results
If you believe these fish have all moved to Iceland , you are deluding yourself
Why is the situation in Iceland better ?
Because the Icel@@ and@@ ers introduced a multiannual cod management plan years ago
It is we who need to catch up , not the other way round
And we need to stick to the facts if we want to make any headway here
I should like to comment mainly on the proposed amendments
However , I must reject Amendment No 2 , because economic considerations cannot be used as an excuse for watering down the measures needed
However , I welcome your support for multiannual management plans , Mr Jové Peres , and gladly accept Amendments Nos 1 , 3 , 6 , 29 and 32
I cannot accept Amendments Nos 35 and 36 because it is up to the Council to set the framework for management plans
However , I gladly accept Amendment No 22 on international guidelines for sustainable fisheries management
I must also reject Amendment No 45 , because we shall be examining access restrictions such as the Shetland Bo@@ x in 2003
I reject the proposed amendments on relative stability because I think that relative stability is part and parcel of our common fisheries policy
I am delighted that the rapporteur agrees in general with our proposals and I welcome these amendments
I accept Amendment No 44 , although we must comply with Community provisions governing data protection
I also accept Amendment No 78
Now for your proposed amendments to the chapter on controls
However , I should like to accept Amendments Nos 51 and 57 in a slightly different form
I cannot accept Amendments Nos 52 to 56 or 62
Nor can I accept Amendment No 12 , because we need effective tools if those who break the rules are to be held liable for the damage they cause
And that includes quota reductions
Finally , I am unfortunately unable to accept your Amendment No 69 , because the basic principles will be included in our new framework regulation in the future
Now to the proposed amendments in Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna 's two reports
First , I have made the Commission 's standpoint on this quite clear
I must say , to my great disappointment , that many of the proposed amendments are designed merely to maintain the status quo
I find that unacceptable and must therefore reject the proposed amendments which refer to it
Nor do I agree with you on exports or joint ventures
However , I can accept Amendment No 3 on the possibility of adapting programme planning during the current Structural Fund period
I can only accept the part of Amendments Nos 19 and 37 designed to promote the diversification of vessels out of fisheries
Finally , I think that Amendment No 27 is superfluous
Now to the final proposal on scrapping
As far as Amendments Nos 3 to 6 and 8 are concerned , here too I must beg to differ
Scientists have been telling us for years that our fleet is far too big and that stocks are depleting under the tremendous pressure from fisheries
Our scientists have repeatedly concluded that TACs and quotas and technical measures alone are not enough
As far as additional funds for scrapping are concerned , we have drawn up calculations based on emp@@ ir@@ ical values
Nor can I accept Amendment No 7 , because the Commission has indeed honoured its obligations by instituting infringement proceedings against Member States who fail to achieve their fleet targets
Anything else would put Member States who have achieved their overall fleet target at a disadvantage
Mr President , the Commissioner said that he could not address the principle of relative stability because it is part of the CFP
CFP reform , which we should embark on today and in the next few days , is based precisely on the principle of relative stability , which is not un@@ change@@ able
On the other hand , the Commissioner said that another amendment was to maintain the status quo
The status quo in Community waters is maintained by the Commission and Mr Fischler , Mr President
I have received the motion for a resolution corresponding to this oral question on the cod crisis
I am delighted that you support this proposal
It will enable our fishermen to continue fishing in Senegal until 30 June 2006
I think this protocol is of huge interest to both parties
Senegal will receive a financial contribution of EUR 16 million and we shall be helping Senegal to build up sustainable fisheries
The fishing zones for Community ships have been reduced and coastal zones have been reserved for the local ar@@ tisanal fleet
Finally , we have increased compulsory landings for the Senegalese fishing industry in the new protocol
The agreement offers our fleet stability , because the new protocol will run for four years , and flexibility , thanks to the new system for calculating fishing opportunities
In turn , this will foster higher utilisation rates and hence a better cost-benefit ratio
The Senegalese authorities have confirmed that our fisheries will not endanger stocks because , even during the period from 1997 to 2001 , Community catches only accounted for between 1
By comparison , our vessels accounted for 25 % of landings for the local industry in 1997
Now to the proposed amendments
I agree with the content of Amendments Nos 1 , 3 and 4 but in form they are , I think , superfluous
The Commission already passes on the information called for
We are required to do so under the interinstitutional agreements , especially the framework agreement between the Commission and Parliament
I cannot accept Amendment No 5 , because this is a protocol to a fisheries agreement
As an addendum to a framework agreement , no new mandate is required in order to renew a protocol
I must also reject Amendment No 2 for this fisheries protocol
However , I promise to propose this sort of clause during negotiations on future fisheries agreements with third countries
Perhaps , Commissioner , it would be a good idea to promote measures for transparency , clarity and flexibility as well within the scope of maritime trading legislation
I shall now move on to the EU/@@ Senegal Fisheries Agreement , to say that we should set out fisheries possibilities in Senegalese waters and the financial contribution
I do not want to say too much because a great deal of data already appears in the report
All of which , like the setting of lower by-@@ catch rates and larger mesh sizes , demonstrates the importance of this
It is equally important to ensure an increased number of Senegalese seamen on board EU vessels
The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights therefore does not draw any distinctions and its first article states that human dignity is inviolable
an achievable agreement is always the best one
The agreement is clearly a meeting of wills , and often - almost always - both parties must make concessions in order to reach the agreement
The Members of this Parliament are not in the habit of offering congratulations , but I believe this is a good agreement and we should congratulate the Commission
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11
I am delighted that you support this proposal granting Community vessels access to Angolan waters until 2 August 2004
The new protocol is in the mutual interest of the Community and Angola and contains a few new clauses , which I should like to comment on
Stocks in Angolan waters will be checked annually by local scientists in the interest of sustainable fisheries
As a basis for this scientific knowledge , or should I say as a result of this scientific knowledge , fishing opportunities will be revised in line with it
This is a net improvement over the 28 % earmarked for targeted action in the last protocol
Not just tuna vessels but all fishing vessels will have to carry six Angolan fishermen , compared with five previously
This will create an additional 160 to 180 jobs locally
I should like to comment briefly on the proposed amendments
Basically , the same applies as I said earlier about the protocol with Senegal
On the question of including the Member States ' obligation under Regulation 5@@ 00@@ /@@ 2001 , with ships declaring their catches in third countries , this is not possible
But I am more than willing to include this obligation in any new agreement , because this is something that needs to be negotiated
With regard to de@@ mer@@ sal fishing , Spain has received the lion 's share , with Portugal , Italy and Greece sharing the rest
The annual financial compensation has risen from EUR 14 million to EUR 15
This is a contribution by the European Union to the development of fishing in Angola
5 billion are going to specific measures for research , control and monitoring , as the Commissioner has already rightly pointed out
One report by the International Monetary Fund even states that EUR four billion have been poured into the State 's coffers but have moved along impenetrable and tor@@ tuous routes
Does this mean that the European Union should not support Angola ?
What it means is that Angola has entered a new phase in its history , which has been plagued by civil wars , death and destruction
Angola 's fishing industry is extremely interesting
This is something I read in a book on the history and economy of Angola
In 1999 , around 190 000 tonnes were brought in
It also means , however , if the scientific data are not misleading , that Angola has considerable opportunities for fishing and that Angolan waters contain a wealth of fish
The texts also state that fishing in Angola represents 3 % of the gross national product and so any effort to support the Angolan fishing industry is to be welcomed
I therefore wish to congratulate the Commissioner and the Commission on the result they have achieved
As Mr L@@ age himself stated , this is a further renewal of the Fisheries Agreement with Angola that began in 1987 and is now being renewed once again
As has also been said , European Union vessels fish in those waters for tuna , shrimp , de@@ mer@@ sal species and , on an experimental basis , some pelag@@ ic species
Perhaps this situation of illegal tuna fishing in all tropical waters will not be too different to this reduction in the tuna fishing quota in the Agreement with Angola
It should also be emphasised that when calculating the EU 's financial compensation , which is also increasing , we must also take account of the rates paid by shipowners
As the report also clearly states , EU compensation has risen from EUR 14 million to EUR 15
5 million and in fact it is important to note that 35 % of these appropriations are specifically earmarked for the development of the fishing sector
It should also be stated that this agreement with Angola represents gradual progress in the field of fisheries agreements with third countries
This considerable allocation of appropriations to the fishing sector is important and shows that it is possible to conclude commercial fishing agreements that contain a development component
I should also like to mention , on behalf of my group , the PPE-DE , that we will be supporting this report , which we believe to be well-@@ grounded
Not content with destroying the North Sea , Africa is now the prize
There are now 16 third country agreements in place
Today we are discussing Angola and , according to the World Wil@@ dlife Fund , this deal will strip a vulnerable African coastal community of a precious asset
Ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tive documentary evidence from Mauritania and Senegal confirms the scale of this tragedy
The contempt with which our ple@@ ad@@ ings have met leads me to think that most of the rest of you must in@@ habit a different planet
There is a better way
Ten years ago , Namibia threw out the Spanish boats and took control over her 200@@ -@@ mile territorial waters
14 000 people now work in an industry worth USD 350 million a year
Namibia should be our model if we really want to help the third world
Let us stop exploiting these poor countries and encourage them to modernise their industries
Let us recognise that the only fishery management schemes that work around the world are the ones with national control
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a
We have the whole of ' blue Europe ' stretching out before us waiting to be reorganised
Our instruments for managing catches , the market , fleets and relations with third countries are criticised by professionals
The Commission wants to act as a substitute for the Council of Ministers in decision-making processes
It persists in its Mal@@ thusi@@ anism tactics by scrapping boats and even by refusing to fund modernisation
This is how , in addition to jeopardising the safety of fishermen , the problem of unfair competition arises
Whilst we undermine our own industry 's fishing possibilities , other fishermen from third countries are coming in their place
The margin for manoeuvre is , nevertheless , very small
This is the absolute limit of industrial fishing
regionalisation of management for greater flexibility , more accurate scientific evaluation of resources to avoid disputes , greater involvement of the profession ?
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , what I have to say about today 's report is this
As someone so nicely put it , the twenty-first century will be the century of Europe but only , I would add , if we want it to be
This all depends primarily on human rather than state resources , not on equality for all , but on competitive ideas that strengthen the continent of Europe as a whole
we therefore welcome , by way of conclusion , the overall approach of the Commission communication on streamlining the annual economic and employment policy coordination cycles
We need this coordination in order to achieve common objectives despite differing jurisdictions
We therefore call for a tripartite social summit to be set up , with the participation of the European Parliament
We have no time for legal wrangling between institution@@ s; we need to foster this social dialogue jointly and involve organisations of social partners
We welcome the fact that this process has been streamlined
We welcome the fact that the focus is on implementation
We welcome specific timing arrangements and we welcome the fact that a strategic , medium-term policy concept is being strengthened
If we ensure that life is brea@@ thed into this communication , then we shall be one step closer to the Lisbon strategy
I shall confine my comments to a few basic issues
First , the report supports the focus on the medium term
This means that we need to be much more sparing when changing and revising the guidelines
The Commission will approve a package of guidelines in keeping with the new programme for the first time in April 2003 , covering the three years up to 2006
We need to avoid any major changes in the guidelines before this mid-term review in 2006
We have proven that it is far better to keep to the guidelines and ensure they are applied than to constantly add new elements
Of course , the Commission will review the employment recommendations for each individual country every year in order to ensure that they still reflect political developments in each Member State
May I remind you that the Treaty requires us to produce this annual report , which will take the form of application monitoring
That brings me to the second aspect , which is consistency and complementarity
It is vital that the two procedures complement each other if we are to achieve the maximum possible coordination between economic policy and employment policy
We had a fair degree of overlap in the past@@ ; on occasions , however , we also had contradictory approaches to the two strategies
Thirdly , there is a need to focus on application
May I remind you that , in the past , information on these two procedures often came in at different times , giving rise to a great deal of confusion
The big issue as far as evaluating employment policies is concerned is that neither the social partners nor the national parliaments have been properly involved
Finally , I must say that this proposal respects the need for autonomous procedures , as required under the Treaty
In short , the economic guidelines provide an overall framework for economic policy but the employment strategy has the necessary degree of autonomy
I am delighted that Parliament supports this approach
We have a long history of collaboration with the European Parliament on the employment strategy
I think that we now have an opportunity for even more efficient and substantial collaboration
Parliament has worked on this Commission proposal in a very focused manner , in a very focused and very concerted manner
We were quick and we agreed across the committee and party political divide , under Mr Karas 's guidance , on what I think is a good position
And because we have worked in such a quick and concerted manner , we can formulate clear demands on exactly what sort of coordination is required
This must be crystal clear and must be expressed in the procedures we choose
I say that quite advis@@ edly in the present debate on job market reforms and the reform of social security systems
Of course we need systems to be flexible and adaptable , but we also need them to be modern
And a modern system is a system that offers security , security for job seekers , job security , security in the event of illness , old age or disability
That is why economic reform is a means to an end when it comes to maintaining and renewing the European social model , not the other way round
If this is what we want , we have to put the objectives of competitiveness , social security and full employment on a par with each other
We have to find ways of linking these goals and making them mutually supportive
Secondly , if we want to do justice to Lisbon and Gothenburg , we must stop beating about the environmental bush
We must use the full potential of environmental policy in order to make it work for qualifications and employment
Thirdly , as Mr Karas quite rightly points out in his report , economic policy is a matter of common interest which deserves to be coordinated
Parliament will be involved in this discussion and we must secure our rightful place in it
Madam President , we in the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats support the proposals of Mr Karas and the Commission
When it comes to economic and employment policy in the European Union , the hour of truth is drawing ever nearer
The demands and the objectives from Lisbon and Gothenburg must now become reality
Simplification is more important than streamlining
Increased participation , increased openness and increased transparency are important
For us Christian Democrats , it is also important to assert that we are in favour of a social , ecological and ethically based market economy in Europe
It must provide room for personal , responsible creativity and also for security and initiative
It is important that the environmental objective from Gothenburg be combined with the economic growth requirement and social cohesion to achieve the three dimensions
We regret that the Commission has not included this in its communication
As Christian Democrats let us also emphasise that trust as well as ethical and moral values are fundamental to social and economic development
If the economy lacks trust and an ethical and moral base , it cannot be developed
The European Parliament must achieve greater participation without necessarily demanding the right to make decisions
It is about giving the European Parliament not only the right to be present but also time
Unfortunately it took the Lisbon process , some six years later , to grab this opportunity and I am delighted that we have now moved from theory into practice
Commissioner , we have great expectations of the Commission; we expect an agreement to be reached
Europe is sorely in need of one
And that applies not just to economic and employment policy; it also applies to social and environmental policy
Europe is sorely in need of one because we cannot afford the luxury of uncoordinated policies
The Delors Commission concluded at one point that uncoordinated policies were costing us growth , which automatically means they are costing us jobs in the European Union
We are counting on an end to this situation and from that point of view this new paper really is most welcome
Unfortunately , to the disappointment of European economic researchers , this is still not the case
Madam President , no coordination , no procedure can be effective if there is a lack of political will
This must be our starting point
Some good objectives were set out in Lisbon and Gothenburg , but there is a huge gap between what is said and what is done
The European Union is facing serious economic problems , its growth potential is slowing down , public and private investment is very weak and it is lacking skills
Neither the Stability and Growth Pact nor the monetary policy is dealing with these challenges
There is no genuine European economic policy due to differences between the Member States
Coordination cycles do not examine economic relationships between countries
And we do not yet have a global approach to the European economy and the eurozone , considered in the context of globalisation
We do not yet have a policy on demand , networks or human capacities
I shall now turn to institutional procedures
What the Commission is proposing to us is purely technocratic
I am in favour of merging different areas and setting up a cycle
I agree with the principle of streamlining
However , this will not remove the aforementioned political obstacles , hence my suggestions
First of all , the Treaties provide no solid basis for communitarisation of the economic policy
Our priority must therefore be to establish this basis in the Convention
As a priority , we must therefore provide the Union with investigative and analytical resources which are equal to its statements
Thirdly , the proposed procedures do not yet have any democratic value
Fourthly , I do not believe that the European Parliament is today still capable of properly debating and of choosing a coherent economic policy
Too many positions held are marked by national interests alone and ideological mind@@ sets
Having said that , Parliament is better placed than the Council and the Commission to deliberate and assess the economic policy
An annual interactive discussion is therefore necessary between national communities and the Community institutions at Parliament 's initiative
Only then will the Commission draft its proposals , only then will the decision be referred back to the Council , but Parliament could then have a power of ratification
To sum up , without shared political will and a common democratic procedure , the coordination of national policies will fail
Madam President , the report we are now discussing is an important step on the way towards implementing the Lisbon objectives
The fact is that , besides failing to reinforce the Lisbon objectives with an environmental objective , there are also still many issues which remain to be resolved
We must also make sure that the environmentally harmful subsidies are abolished
This is included in the concept of ' sustainable development ' , but the Commission does not really seem to have accepted this or thought it through yet
The Commission must do this in a much more focused way
All the work on sustainable development in this agenda has completely the wrong focus and is going far too slowly on the part of the Commission
Madam President , like many other speakers , I think that the Commission communication is very narrow
What is being discussed is coordination of the economic guidelines and employment guidelines
We are agreed , however , that the concept must be expanded
We need an environmental process and , especially , we also need a social process as an important part of the total process which was developed from the Lisbon Summit
These four parts , which are each of independent importance , must be coordinated
It is incredibly important to talk about social integration , work for all , good quality work
Many of these things are usually carried forward by the Commission
I think this is so serious that I would like to formulate a kind of warning
We are already seeing such trends today on Europe 's labour market and these will become even clearer in the future
If we have this type of conflict to fight against , I believe that this is almost the worst thing that can happen for economic development in Europe
Furthermore , I would like to add something which has to do with synchronisation and coordination
A kind of horizontal coordination of the economy and employment at European level is now being discussed
I think that , here too , we must talk about social and environmental issues
At the same time , there is vertical coordination between levels
I would like to emphasise this particularly , as it is sometimes said rather vaguely that the national parliaments have to be given a greater place
My answer is always that responsibility must be given to the national parliaments
Madam President , I would like to thank our rapporteur Mr Karas
He has had a very challenging task to streamline the measures of coordination
I fully welcome the efforts of the Commission in this respect and I want to thank our Commissioner , Mrs Diamantopoulou , for your courage in proposing these items
In the report , Parliament says that we have two items which are important
This is a text from the report and it shows that , for Parliament , implementation of present coordination mechanisms is really important
We have not seen enough concrete results from the coordination mechanisms and we need concrete results
We should use the current mechanisms
In practice , this will allow us to discharge our responsibility towards future generations and the countries whose development is lagging behind
I would like to focus briefly on the instruments necessary for the practical implementation of this strategy
The success of such a policy depends on the genuine participation of all the institutional levels and all the social players
Without this widespread committed involvement , development will not be sustainable
Lastly , I would like to take this opportunity to sound the alarm , and in this I am supported , inter alia , by the Civil Society Contact Group
The preliminary draft Constitutional Treaty presented by the Chairman of the Convention does not contain any reference to the concept of sustainable development
Madam President , the Lisbon strategy is due for re-evaluation at the special summit next spring
This is not just about evaluating whether the objectives have been implemen@@ ted; measures will also need to be corrected and new elements introduced
I totally fail to understand why the Commission refuses to include ecological objectives
We have discussed the possibility of a new edition of the Stability Pact in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs
My group , the PPE-DE , is against watering it down because that would undermine the stability of the euro and make people anxious
I think that greater involvement of the social partners in a tripartite social summit and a strengthened macroeconomic dialogue are noteworthy ideas
I think there are three important points in O@@ th@@ mar Karas 's excellent report
First , we need better coordination of economic policy , employment policy and social integration
The annual guidelines are the main tool for coordinating employment policy
It is a shame that numerous Member States agree on the objectives but then fail to put them into practice
Secondly , Parliament needs to be comprehensively involved in preparations for the spring summit
That means having enough time in the run up to the summit to examine the Commission 's proposal
We really must be allowed enough time
We call on the Commission to ensure the relevant departments in these countries are involved in a technically - and more important - logis@@ tically efficient manner
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a
Madam President , we welcome the important step being taken today in the field of health and safety at work
The proposal on risks to workers from physical agents was submitted eight years ago and the first part , on noise , was approved this year
So we realise just how difficult , both technically and politically , this type of legislation is
Today 's final draft of the directive contains three important achievements
First , it provides greater protection for workers in all sectors of the economy , including sea and air transport , which were not covered under current legislation
Ap@@ pro@@ val of this directive completes the second stage of the Commission proposal on risks from physical agents
More work is needed on the remaining two sections of the Commission proposal , namely electro@@ magnetic fields and op@@ tical radiation
I am delighted , moreover , that the Commission has consistently placed the issue high on its agenda
We all know that noise is a very serious problem for the working environment
It is an area which has been fully explained in terms of science
We know that , in actual fact , very little noise is needed to cause lasting damage to hearing
It is , then , a very serious state of affairs we are talking about
I am therefore extremely pleased at our being able , tomorrow , to adopt a directive that gives workers better protection than that which they have at present
I should like to have seen a lower limit , which is something I also proposed
I should also like to have seen no account taken of protection from personal protection measures , but what we have here is nonetheless an improvement
The other very positive factor is that the directive systematically attaches importance to the prevention made so much of in the framework directive
Prevention is in terms of action values but , in connection with the directive , we have also attached importance to ensuring the presence of properly functioning hearing protectors
There are , however , a number of other provisions that are to be avoided
We must implement alternative working methods that minimise exposure to noise
We must examine the work tools used in enterprises
Overall , employers ' responsibility for making the directive work is emphasised in the directive itself
The directive provides protection and , in addition , it naturally makes clear the responsibility of employers in individual work situations
This is a much discussed subject
We have heard about the British pop industry and about bag@@ pipe players , all of which li@@ ven@@ ed up the debate
Irrespective of whether it sounds pleasant or unpleasant , noise can cause very serious damage to hearing
We have only to look to our own experience
We are of course aware of who is most often affected by the illness known as tin@@ nit@@ us
It is , in point of fact , people who have lived with pleasant noise or who have been affected by very pleasant noise , namely music
We know , therefore , that noise is noise
I am pleased that the directive recognises this so clearly
The directive also acknowledges that the music sector may possibly have difficulty implementing the directive 's provisions within the deadline that has been fixed
It has therefore extended the deadline for implementing the directive
I am also very pleased that we have attached importance to prevention and to getting things to work in practice
We have established a transitional period , but this is also to be used for preparing standards governing the behaviour of the whole of the music and entertainment sectors
I am very satisfied with these standards because they are forward-looking and because they will , in a practical way , help the sector to observe the rules
It is not just a question of being comb@@ ative
Good ideas emerge too , which can lead to constructive compromises , and that is something many of us are pleased about
In that connection , gratitude must also of course be expressed to the Commission for the role it has played and to the Council for its constructive cooperation
Finally , I just want to say how pleased I am that we have achieved such a broad compromise and such considerable support here in the Chamber
That is a view I hope the ELDR Group will comply with tomorrow
I look forward to our obtaining a really large majority for a good directive
In this particular instance , the first proposal dates back to 1993
The noise directive was certainly no easy task , with the Council and Parliament taking up somewhat different positions
But the whole purpose of the conciliation procedure is to bring about agreement even so
Such agreement is , by its very nature , always a compromise but , as I said , we all have reason to be satisfied with this particular compromise
Objec@@ tively speaking , noise protection has been increas@@ ed; the previous speaker explained the technical data and details
But what is important is that it is clear-@@ cu@@ t; there are no grey areas or confusing discretionary powers when it comes to implementation
The employer 's obligation to provide hearing protectors , check they are effective and make sure people wear them is new
This sets out employers ' general duty of care without any room for misunderstanding
My group was also concerned that an allowance should be made for the music and entertainment industry when it comes to applying the directive
It is therefore simply more honest to allow a transitional period here and let the individual Member States and social partners decide what they want to do themselves
I should just like to emphasise that , however pleasing it is on paper , this directive needs to be applied in practice
I am becoming more and more convinced that employee protection directives look very pretty on paper but that nobody actually wants to implement them
That may have something to do with economic developments , but it is precisely during hard times that we need to make sure that directives are implemented
I say that with one eye very firmly on the candidate countries because we must set a very clear example here too
Four subjects were covered by the original physical agents directive , noise was one , but the original 1986 directive on noise was due for revision in 1991
Here we are almost at the end of 2002 before we finally have a revised text
Progress is painfully slow
I hope we will see a renewed sense of urgency on the part of Council
The directive is to be welcomed
It will bring about direct improvements
Workers will be exposed less to noise at work
Then their representatives will play a part in risk assessment in the choice of hearing protectors
Our preventative audi@@ o-@@ metric testing will be made available under certain circumstances
All of these things and many others are to be welcomed
For the music and entertainment sector , I think we have established a very good approach
The approach has been very much welcomed by the Mu@@ si@@ ci@@ ans Union of Great Britain who acted to coordinate the work of musici@@ ans ' unions across the European Union
In the interests of time , I will make just one other point
Many voices were raised in conciliation about the importance of business impact assessment on proposals of this sort - rigorous impact assessment
Because that is the part of the hearing spectrum industrial hearing loss often destroys
Madam President , we have moved a long way from when the rapporteur brought a report first to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee
I think we still have problems for the entertainment and leisure industry but the rest of industry and the workers will find this directive very easy to live with
I am glad we have moved back to the weekly measurement granted by Member States if they so deem necessary
The reason it is not being implemented is because it is not workable
My problem is that if we add another layer of bureaucracy for the pub and club industry like this , we will cause tremendous problems
That is why I personally refuse to sign off the conciliation because I believe we could have got more from the Council
I was on my own apart from one notable exception so I appreciate the vote tomorrow will not make any difference at all to the final outcome
We have , through a lot of hard work , got a better deal for industry and workers alike
We could have got a better deal for the entertainment and leisure sector and I am sorry we did not take that opportunity
Madam President , may I just say what a pleasure it is to be invited to take the floor at five minutes to midnight
Regarding this one , this concili@@ ated text is in my view a bad compromise on a bad directive
It would have been much better for both parties to have kept their original positions and for the legislation to have fallen
Certainly I voted against it; I was the notable exception referred to by my colleague Li@@ z Lynne
I also voted against it in the conciliation committee for this reason , even though we did manage to dilute many of the d@@ after amendments during that committee process
As far as the UK is concerned , existing noise regulations have been well thought through and these tighter regulations at EU level are neither necessary nor appropriate
Mr Hughes mentioned the importance of business impact assessments and that they should be carried out thoroughly
It is significant that there has been no proper regulatory impact assessment at EU level to determine the costs and benefits of the proposed directive
Certainly there was one done by the UK which established that the costs far outweigh@@ ed the benefits and perhaps that is why the EU decided not to do one
This legislation does not reflect the real world
The UK Conservative response will not be lim@@ p
We will stand up for common sense and vote against it
I thought that sense had triumphed
I think there is another reason why implementation should give us cause for concern
I heard today about a professional musici@@ an working with a famous German orchestr@@ a who turned down an interview with us out of fear of reprisals
He was to have described his problems as a professional musici@@ an but was too frightened to do so , and I am sure he is not the only case
Employe@@ e protection , as Mrs Stauner said , is a basic necessity in modern working life , not a superfluous luxury
There are several options open to the Member States here , not just passive hearing protection
They can also introduce new working methods and develop new jobs in which noise levels are kept to a minimum
A huge amount of work went into that position
From the United Kingdom position , we were left with the situation where a number of issues had to be ironed out
I think it is important not to caricature health and safety measures when a huge amount of work has gone into ir@@ oning out those national positions
We heard a lot from Mrs Lynne about the impact on musici@@ ans in the entertainment sector
We have all in the United Kingdom heard much said on this
The fact is that those sectors have been satisfied by what could have been a far more difficult directive
The rapporteur is to be congratulated on the progress made
That is why I will be voting in favour
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a
A further nine million are b@@ red and destroyed as surplus to requirements
Since Directive 8@@ 6/@@ 6@@ 0@@ 9 , which controls the use of animals in experiments , was first implemented more than 16 years ago , a great deal has changed
The original purpose of the Directive was to avoid distortions in trade
Today , animal welfare is the subject of extensive public debate and interest and concern about the use of animals has escal@@ ated
Also , enormous progress has been made in scientific knowledge and practice
The Commission has already made a commitment to review the Directive next year
I hope that the points on which we have focussed in this report will guide their work because there are many lessons to be learnt
In 1986 , Parliament called for a standing committee to monitor the implementation of the Directive but it was not done
I believe this has proved to be a mistake
There is great variation between the Member States in the way that information is coll@@ ated and in the way that replacement , reduction and refinement are applied
For example , the Commission has already published two sets of statistics on the number and use of animals in experiments
The data is required every three years
It does not have to contain very much detail and there has been no standard format for presenting it
Some Member States publish very detailed statistics annually while others publish the bare minimum as infrequently as possible
This has made evaluating the implementation of the Directive difficult
We need data to be published annually and in a standard format
The use of alternative testing methods is , of course , central
Animal experiments should be seen as exceptions to the rule rather than normal scientific procedures
Work on alternatives is progressing fast
This is where Member States should be concentrating and giving priority
Rel@@ ated to this is Article 7 of this Directive , which states that animals should be used for experiments only where there is no scientifically viable alternative
Given that the Commission does not currently require detailed information on statistics , it is impossible to monitor whether this article is actually being implemented
That is why the report recommends a central EU database including information on all animal experiments approved , currently performed and finalised
This would allow for EU-wide checks to ensure that article was being implemented and that experiments were not being duplicated
While the number of animals used for experiments had appeared to be reducing , the use of transgenic animals is rising
This is something that could not have been foreseen in 1986 when the Directive was adopted
There is inadequate provision for it in the Directive as a result
Trans@@ genic animals must be included
Finally , many complaints from NGOs and other bodies and organisations relate to breaches of Article 5 on the general care and accommodation of animals
This can largely be overcome by an EU-wide standard training course including animal welfare and the ethics of experiments
There are four amendments to the report
I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment
I would also like to thank Mr Nisticò in particular for discussing his amendments with me
I can support Amendment No 3
I believe there is general agreement in Parliament and in the Commission that Directive 8@@ 6/@@ 6@@ 0@@ 9 is neither suitable nor effective today and that we need new legislation
I hope that the Commission will take up Parliament 's recommendations
I welcome the own-initiative report by the European Parliament on the Directive on the protection of laboratory animals
I would like to thank Parliament and Mrs Evans for the initiative and the work accomplished
The report comes at the right moment to maintain the momentum for the in-depth revision of the Directive
In March 2003 , we will convene a meeting of a technical expert working group
Experts from all stakeholders should elaborate on specific issues including those raised in the report
However , I would just like to say that development and testing of weapons on animals and the respective ban proposed in the report are not covered by Community competence
We have been actively pursuing these cases and therefore four out of the nine cases presented in the report have already been successfully closed
In conclusion , I consider the report to be most welcome
It provides the key elements for the in-depth revision of the Directive
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support for the two-@@ step approach we have taken for amending the Directive
The first step is currently under way and concerns the inclusion of the procedure for technical adaptation into the Directive
Parliament adopted the proposal in July 2002 without amendments
However , a modification in the wording has recently become necessary and Council is likely to adopt a common position
Therefore , for the second reading , I would like to ask you again for a rapid adoption
The second step for amending the Directive will , of course , be the in-depth revision
Moreover , we need to acknowledge that , for certain specific purposes , it is still necessary to use sub@@ human prim@@ ates today
I have tabled three amendments
I am going to withdraw the second , but Amendments Nos 1 and 3 stand as before
If Amendment No 1 is not adopted , I shall regrettably be forced - as I have already told the rapporteur - to abstain in the final vote
I think we were right to highlight the Member States 's poor implementation of the 1986 directive
I also think that the report shows very clearly the need for tightening up the current rules
Among the areas I would earmark for tightening up is the area of application
We must establish some clear ethical rules
I also believe it is very important for us to obtain a central database for approved animal experiments , both current and completed and both successful and manifestly unsuccessful
I think it important that we obtain a combined database of this kind so that we avoid repeating experiments that have already been carried out
On the other hand , we are unable to support Amendments Nos 1 and 2
I firmly believe that we are not bound to love animals but that we do have a duty to respect them
This , too , is a way of measuring the degree of civilisation of a people
Madam President , Commissioner , it is late , and I shall be brief
I am delighted with this report
My thanks to the Commissioner for what she has just said
I am delighted that my proposed amendments were accepted by everyone in the Committee on the Environment
My thanks also to my friend Mr Nisticò , even if there is one question we disagree on
I think it is morally reprehensible to take prim@@ ates from the wild
The last time a pharmaceutical company dared to bring two ch@@ im@@ pan@@ ze@@ es to Austria from Africa , they were rescu@@ ed
They now live , much be@@ loved by the public , as Li@@ es@@ l and Hi@@ as@@ l in an animal rescue centre in Vienna
As one famous English legal practi@@ tioner once said , you do not ask yourself , can animals think , can animals talk ?
Mr President , it is always a pleasure to hear a committed rapporteur and a committed Commissioner speaking on their common concern in this matter
That , of course , has made the whole debate briefer because it is not interrog@@ atory
I want to say two things
Firstly , it is extraordinary that a Directive promul@@ gated in 1986 has still not been properly implemented in some Member States
I agree with Mr Lund about Mr Nisticò 's amendments
I have to say with great respect that I do not think I can support Amendments Nos 1 or 2 which he has withdrawn
I also feel that we need to look very carefully in this Directive at exactly how the process of experimentation will go in the future
replacement , reduction and scaling down
I would add reflection - we ought to reflect before every experiment is carried out
What will the results be ?
It will be a good day for Parliament if we can do this as well as for the animals under consideration
Madam President , a great deal has been said this evening on this subject
Directive 8@@ 6/@@ 6@@ 0@@ 9 laid down provisions which reflected the - as yet quite limited - understanding of that time
This failure to comply has taken different forms but it is still failure to comply
I believe that there must be an undertaking in this regard
The debate is closed
The vote will take place later today at 11 a
More precisely , this directive concerns the victims of trafficking and smuggling under these two types of offence , which must not be confused with one another
One of the key elements of dismantling networks that exploit migrants lies in obtaining information
The victims are in the best position to be able to provide this type of information to the authorities
And , without this information , the authorities will find it more difficult to combat trafficking networks
It is important to point out straightaway that trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings form an integral part of our economy today
It is essentially about treating people as if they were nothing more than merchandise
At the same time victims of trafficking in human beings are victims of a whole range of abuses and criminal practices
Trafficking in human beings has now also become the subject matter for committees , with nearly everyone seem@@ ing to want to take up a position on it
What is frequently overlooked is that trafficking in human beings is prolifer@@ ating because corruption , along with indifference and dis@@ belief , is prolifer@@ ating
In a number of countries soon to become members of the European Union , parents sell their children in the hope of giving them a better future
This proposal for a directive is a first and consequently important step towards eventual concrete action
The essence of the proposal is that , here , governments and the victims have shared interests , in particular that the criminal networks be shut down
For the purposes of this special directive , the Commission has taken trafficking in human beings and smuggling of human beings together
It is indeed the case that in purely legal terms they are two quite different things , but in reality the distinction is extremely difficult to make
This proposal for a directive is however based on thorough practical knowledge of experts active in the field
The experience we have acquired in Belgium for example proves that the instrument of a short-term residence permit does not miss its mark
Other Member States too have such systems , albeit with varying degrees of success
I fully support the Commission 's proposal and it is fundamentally important that its content remains intact
They turn it into an empty shell
Voting for these amendments will be barely concealed approval for the practices of organised crime
What I want to say is that this directive stands or falls by the minimum social provision for victims
A victim will never want to cooperate if he or she is not offered the beginnings of an alternative to the situation in which they currently find themselves
Allow me to say a few words on two other points
Firstly , there are some who would want this directive to apply immediately to minors too
At first glance this seems a good idea , simply because we can never do enough for the extremely vulnerable position of minors
What is forgotten , however , is that what this directive is offering in the end is only a minimum
This does not alter the fact that there is a real need for a special effort for victims who are minors
Finally , I would like to say something else regarding a number of original amendments from Mrs van der Laan - Amendments Nos 20 , 25 and 35
Her alert legal mind envisages the possibility that in certain cases contact between victim and criminal can be accepted by the authorities to further the investigation
It is a tempting idea , but it is a legal minefield in a number of countries
The risk of kidnappings or even of manipulation and intimidation is also very real
Victims willing to cooperate with the authorities want absolutely no contact at all with the criminals , not even from a distance
I should also like to emphasise that this directive sets aside a special place for specialised and recognised NGOs , but also for international organisations and government agencies
It is also important in this regard to emphasise that where NGOs are concerned they must be NGOs recognised by the state
After all , anyone , even criminals , can set up NGOs
Or , as not un@@ commonly happens , NGOs can be infiltrated and manipulated
I therefore think that everyone involved with this matter should sign a code of conduct
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , international estimates indicate that traffickers in human beings transport up to 700 000 people every year , mainly women and children
Every year , 120 000 women and children are lured into the European Union from the countries of Central and Eastern Europe alone
These figures do not take account of either illegal immigration or the smuggling of human beings
This highlights the urgent need for coordinated measures against this form of organised crime
The proposal for a directive , which provides for short-term residence permits to be issued to victims who cooperate with the competent authorities , is an important step
Up to now , there have not been any pan-European arrangements for dealing with the victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings
However , we need common European standards if we are to combat this form of crime
The short-term residence permits proposed here will not undermine the current practice of de@@ porting illegal immigrants
That must be our goal
At this point I would once again like to thank Mrs Sörensen very sincerely for all the commitment she has put into this report
I would also like to thank the Commission and the other groups for their helpful cooperation , which I believe has led to a good end result in this report
The aim is therefore to issue a short-term residence permit to the victims of these networks who cooperate with the courts or the police
A measure of this kind has been in force in Belgium , the Netherlands and in Italy and has had a very positive effect
It would be unfair to refuse them this right due to the fact that they often only have false identity papers
Let us note that it is essential that the Member States be required to protect the anonymity of victims of trafficking by only organising trials held in camera
We are therefore on the verge of making great progress in Europe in combating trafficking in human beings
This right was laid down in Article 12 of the Commission 's proposal
D@@ ele@@ ting this provision would completely distort the directive
Victims who have no way out of their situation would have great difficulty in cooperating with the police authorities and would easily fall back into the hands of mafi@@ a-@@ like networks
This initiative will make victims stronger and will help them to cut ties with their illegal past as soon as they have seve@@ red relations with the criminal network
We owe aid and assistance to the victims
This is how to ensure they remain law-@@ abiding men and women
Their long@@ ings are odi@@ ously exploited by all kinds of profiteers including those who transport these people to Europe and those who exploit their vulnerability within our own Member States
Many young women see their lives wrecked through prostitution and drugs
Others are exploited in hazardous occupations and are miserably remunerated outside any form of social protection system
People smuggling and trafficking in human beings must therefore be combated by every means available under the rule of law
This directive provides us with an additional opportunity to seize the big players
We naturally have a responsibility to help the victims and give them the opportunity of a better life
I believe that many of them may have reasons for remaining within the EU if they so wish , but that must happen through the customary channels
With the help of the victims , what counts is getting at the big villains
Mrs Sörensen 's proposal improves the directive which can , however , be made better still
She herself mentioned a number of proposals
I want to thank Mrs Sörensen for a very good piece of work
I am fully aware that the police and prosecution services long for a framework directive
As politicians , we must nonetheless make an overall assessment and , just as the previous speaker said , balance various interests
I do not like texts that confuse crimes against the individual with crimes against the state
We have had problems along these lines with previous directives dealing specifically with trafficking
Naturally , we need bilateral police cooperation worthy of the name
That , precisely , is one of the problems
Directives do not help , therefore
The majority of the people being dealt with at present are women and children who are being sexually exploited
I cannot support this report because of what I take to be its cynical approach to these people
Mr President , the Commission 's proposal is a creditable attempt as a Union , to get a better grip on smuggling of human beings and trafficking in human beings
The circumstances under which people enter countries illegally are tragic and degrading
All legal means must be used to tackle the criminals who show no mercy in their quest to earn big money
The means proposed here can make a contribution to this
Similar legislation for victims of trafficking in human beings was successfully introduced in the Netherlands some years ago
Mrs Sörensen however immediately puts her finger on the weak point in the Commission 's proposal
The definition ' victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration ' is unclear
She proposes following the lead of the UN protocol against smuggling of migrants and using the term ' victims of smuggling of human beings '
The Commission is opposed to following this lead precisely in order to prevent misunderstandings
This directive in fact affects a different group of people from those in the UN protocol
The directive is only concerned with those who can reasonably be regarded as victims and who have experienced harm such as threat to life or assault on their physical integrity
I understand this reasoning , but think that the Commission 's definition will provide for at least as many misunderstandings
In effect we are talking about the same terms
The problem is just that the term must bring to the fore that the people concerned have suffered disproportionate harm
Mrs Sörensen tries to solve this by proposing the term ' victims of smuggling of human beings resulting in exploitation '
This term does not fit the bill either however because what happens then to the physical harm the Commission is talking about ?
Both definitions threaten to lead to abuse of the regulation
The Council must consider carefully whether the offence of smuggling of human beings should be included in the directive in this way
Especially as legislation in this area exists only in Spain
I should also like to note that the deletion of Article 12 does not seem to me to be a good idea
Access to the labour market , to vocational training and education is just one part of what this system should set up
If it is omitted , what reason does the victim then have to cooperate with proceedings against the smugglers of human beings and traffickers in human beings ?
We must not forget that this encompasses the even more frightening phenomenon , which is often omitted and overlooked , of human organ trafficking
I will now turn to the content of the resolution
Mi@@ grants put themselves in the hands of traffickers and smugglers of human beings because legal immigration into ' fortress Europe ' is virtually impossible nowadays
That and that alone is the starting point for all this
It is for that reason alone that it is possible to exploit them in the way that they are being exploited
That is evident from the fact that this report also covers smugglers who do nothing apart from transporting people across borders in return for payment
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to begin by thanking everyone for their contribution to this debate and for the support expressed for the Commission 's proposal
We agree with the amendments intended to clarify the system that has been proposed
We also support the amendments that seek to clarify certain concepts , such as the seriousness of the offences referred to or the examples of vulnerable persons
We cannot , however , support the proposals that eliminate the granting of social benefits such as access to the labour market , to vocational training and to education
Similarly , we feel that minors must not be included in the common rules
The provision of a specific framework that guarantees greater protection for minors , who are particularly vulnerable victims , is of the utmost importance
Lastly , we believe that giving victims the opportunity to maintain relations with trafficking networks in order to work as informers could have terrible consequences
We must be aware of the power of these networks , of the vulnerability of the victims and of the risk that such a solution would entail
I wish once again to thank Parliament for the support it has given this Commission initiative
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 12 noon
That now brings us to the next item on the agenda , but we have a slight problem
Mr Prodi , the President of the Commission , is on his way here , but it will be a little while before he reaches the Chamber
The sitting will therefore be suspended for a few minutes
( The sitting was suspended at 9
Mr President , this is not a procedural issue
The next item is the Commission statement on its contribution to the work of the European Convention
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today , the Commission will present its second contribution to the Convention on the future institutional structure of the Union
The document was essentially drawn up on the basis of the structure of the preliminary draft presented to the Convention by the Pra@@ esidium
' I never thought we could change human nature
Within the Community , Europeans are learning to live together as one and the same people
We are not merging states , we were uniting human beings
If we want to look ahead , far ahead into the future , we need to climb onto the shoulders of the great statesmen who have gone before us
To unite all the citizens of Europe , we must create true harmony between the States and between the peoples
The debate that has taken place in recent months since the Convention opened has already clarified many unclear areas and answered many questions
First , the debate has made it plain that citizens do not want the Union to withdraw from areas where it is present
On the contrary , people want the Union to be more prominent in foreign policy , in justice and security and in social affairs
Moreover , there is broad agreement on the Community method , which is at the heart of so many of our achievements
Our contribution to the Convention seeks to respond to these concerns
the Union must become more democratic , more effective and clearer
The path to these goals has not yet been marked out in detail , but we already know where the starting and finishing lines are
Our path must lead us to build the world 's first true supranational democracy
To give more democratic substance to our structure , we need to establish the roles and responsibilities of the main institutions more clearly
We therefore have two proposals for reform
The first concerns the appointment of the Commission
The President of the Commission should be elected by the European Parliament by at least two-thirds of the votes cast in a secret ballot
The European Parliament will then approve the whole Commission , as appointed by the Council
We propose that both institutions should have the right to pass a motion of censure on the Commission
This will give the institutional triangle more balance and will strengthen the Commission 's position as guarantor of the general interest
For the same reason , we propose to make codecision the rule
All European legislation must be put forward by a Commission proposal , adopted by a majority vote in the Council and co@@ decided by the European Parliament
Its responsibilities are typical of those of all the world 's parliaments
We want to give the European Parliament more power to make decisions on resources
The Union 's budget must therefore be adopted by the European Parliament and the Council by a procedure derived from codecision , as I mentioned a moment ago
As the Pra@@ esidium also acknowledges in its draft Constitutional Treaty , the Union must have its own resources
This would remove the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure
The democratic legitimacy of our institutions , for example , is closely bound up with their functions
Our main proposals in this respect can be summed up in three points
The first point is to abolish unanimous voting , as this rule has played a part in the darkest periods of the Union 's recent history
If the veto has frequently paralysed decision-making with 15 Member States , just think what could happen with 25 or more
That is why I believe majority voting should be the rule
experts find it impossible to understand too
More sensitive decisions would clearly require enhanced majorities
The second point concerns the Presidency of the Council , an issue that has caused rivers of ink to flow
I believe that the proposal for a President of the Union , put forward by several quarters , creates more problems than it solves
There are other concerns too
Who would elect the President of the Union ?
Who would this President be accountable to ?
It is clear that such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure
We therefore recommend maintaining the system of rotation for the Presidency of the European Council , the General Affairs Council and the Committee of Permanent Representatives
This formula will bring greater continuity to the Council 's work and put the Presidency in the hands of persons who enjoy the full confidence of their peers
The Union must act as one in the international arena in order to defend its values and promote its social model
In terms of trade , the Union is already on an equal footing with the other leading players on the world stage
Why , then , can we not be equally credible in the political arena ?
This requires imagination and courage because it is vital for the Union to speak with a single voice in international politics
What we propose is a new post of Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs
The Secretary will be appointed jointly by the European Council and the President of the Commission , and will also be a Vice-President of the Commission
It follows that the Secretary of the Union must report personally to both the European Council and the President of the Commission
As a member of the Commission , though , the Secretary will be jointly accountable along with the other Commissioners before the European Parliament
As you can see , this is a major innovation , but , I repeat , it is unavoidable
I would like to outline these briefly
The Secretary of the Union will autonomously exercise the Commission 's right of initiative in foreign policy in accordance with the Council 's guidelines
The Council , or a group of Member States , may , however , ask the Secretary to present suitable proposals to the Council to achieve common objectives
Various Union activities , such as trade and development cooperation policy , are connected with foreign policy
Continuity in these areas will be ensured by collaboration between the Secretary of the Union and the President of the Commission who , in this respect , will coordinate matters
The issue of the Union 's external representation is also relevant to economic affairs
Represen@@ tation of the euro area in the international arena needs to be settled
it also needs to become a force politically and make its presence felt in the wider world
The third and final key point of our proposal is simplification and clarity
The current volume of directives , decisions and regulations that combine to form our body of legislation is possibly the biggest barrier citizens face in understanding the European institutions
The Commission believes it is time to put in order the instruments at our disposal
The Constitutional Treaty must make a clear distinction between laws and implementing regulations
Moreover , it must be clear who implements European legislation in practice
The principle of transparency must also apply to what is known as comitology
We therefore feel that only advisory committees should be maintained
When the legislator decides to adopt laws at European level , I repeat , the Commission alone should have responsibility for their implementation
The debate aroused by the Convention in recent months has already widened our horizons
The national parliaments and governments have believed in it right from the start , and sent major figures to represent them
The goal of the Convention has become more ambitious
it must establish the overall shape of the Union for generations to come
I am pleased to see this development
The Convention that Parliament and I too wanted so keenly is providing our fellow citizens and the whole world with an analysis of all aspects of our institutions
I am also pleased that this is taking place in the light of day
The coming months will see the emergence of a new , united Europe , and we can be proud that it will have come into being democratically and transparently
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , we warmly applauded the President of the Commission just now
I am pleased for him personally , but I am also pleased about the case he has been making
We cannot always applaud the President of the Commission so enthusiastically
I would also like to add that our group very much supports the Commission as regards the future of the European Union and its institutions
The Community method means the institutions of the European Union acting together and it particularly means that we must very firmly reject the intergovernmental method
In that respect , we are totally at one with the Commission
We want a democratic Europe , and as far as we are concerned a democratic Europe means a representative democracy at EU level
That means the European Parliament being closely involved in all legislative issues , as a 100 % co-legislator , as Mr Romano Prodi said
However , a democratic Europe based on representative democracy also means that we recognise the principle of subsidiarity
If we do not want a chamber at EU level consisting of national Members of Parliament , then we also need to strive to define what tasks are European tasks
The principle of representative democracy must apply at all four of these levels - local authorities , regions , nations and the European Union
That implies that we need to link the Community method at EU level with the principle of subsidiarity
We need Europe to be effective - let me emphasise that point - and to be clearer and easier to understand
As far as we are concerned , a key issue and one linked with the Community method is that the Europe we are building should be a legal Community
make sure that the Convention achieves results
Furthermore , bear in mind that you have important responsibilities which affect many areas
We believe it is a good proposal
There are other proposals which we welcome as working proposals
One of them is that the President of the Commission should be elected by the European Parliament , something which I believe a large majority of this House advocates
We are not convinced that the unanimous approval of the European Council is required
I would point out that the European Council already voted in Cor@@ f@@ u and since then votes for the President of the Commission by majority
Although in your case it was by ac@@ clamation
Similarly we approved the merger of the High Representative of the Council and the Vice-President of the Commission for External Affairs , and this may give us more strength
In any event , we have to take a decisive step towards a common foreign , security and defence policy
And now I will mention those proposals with which we clearly disagree
Firstly , we cannot accept the idea that the European Council can pass a vote of no confidence in the Commission
This would ruin the balance between the institutions
We must move on from co-decision to shared legislative power
To this end there must be a Legislative Council which is truly a second Chamber , that is , one that legisl@@ ates in public and democratically , transparently and clearly
We must tackle the problem of the Council 's combination of executive and legislative power
I would suggest that in this regard we incorporate the Tr@@ ump@@ f and Solana proposals and the contents of the Poos report , which are very sensible
There is nothing of this sort in your proposal and I hope that the Convention will include it
Mr President , with regard to the Pen@@ el@@ ope document , I believe we must work like Pen@@ el@@ ope but in shifts
Certainly the Commission and Parliament will have to work by night to try to redo what others are going to undo by day
And I would remind you that the time for transactions , pacts and compromises is at the end , that is , at the end of the Convention
In the meantime , we will have to work shoulder to shoulder for the common Community cause
Mr President , sometimes it is an advantage to be spokesman for the third group in Parliament because it has provided me with time to read the Commission 's paper
I can , therefore , say with some authority that I strongly welcome it
It is a strong assertion of the Commission 's orthodox function and it should shift the debate about where a power lies , centre stage inside the Convention
It represents a challenge to those Prime Ministers who prefer to opin@@ e on the fr@@ inges of the Convention but who seem far too frightened to contribute official proposals
I wonder if this would not lead to more of the inconsistency and the conflict with the Commission that we have at present
Why not let the Commissioner responsible chair the Council in its formations for economic policy and interior affairs ?
I would very briefly like to mention those points which , on the basis of what you have just said , I support
I also support the proposals for law making that you have just mentioned
I would like to touch on a problem that you did not mention in your speech , and that is the issue of dividing the treaty into two parts
It is generally assumed that this is connected with the fact that the whole constitutional treaty is to be primary legislation
That is why I would be interested to know , Mr President of the Commission , whether your proposal today provides for different review procedures in the constitutional treaty
Mr President , it is a case of better late than never as far as the Commission is concerned
This constitutional process is in fact the first major step where the Commission has lag@@ ged cautiously behind and has , if anything , been reactive instead of leading the way
I nevertheless welcome what President Prodi has said
I too have been unable to read this document as quickly as our friend An@@ drew Duff has , so I can only make a few limited comments
One thing needs to be said about this paper - it does not make any spar@@ ks fly
It does not generate any great enthusiasm or paint any broad canv@@ ases
It does not attempt to involve the public , the citizens of Europe , in this mighty battle for power
It is a very cautious , perhaps technocratic and certainly intelligent , and sometimes even clever paper
Yes , you have come down in favour of the Community method , but in that case you should also have presented a bolder picture of European unity
There are major tasks and important horizons involved in this process of European integration , but you have not presented them here
The social dimension , which is may be the main issue on which the Convention will founder , scarcely gets a mention
The same applies to European democracy
Yes , you are in favour of scrapping the unanimity rule , but it is nevertheless to be retained when it comes to modifying Commission proposals
Un@@ ity and democracy are all very well , but being given power is a little more important
As regards the Charter of Fundamental Rights , I cannot find any reference here to access to the European Court of Justice , which rules on fundamental rights
The role of Parliament is to be enhanced , but the right of initiative remains exclusively that of the Commission
Parliament is to elect the President of the Commission , but the President is also to be accountable to the Council
And the responsibility of the Commission is far from clear , with the Commission being given greater scope for tactical manoeuvring , while the public is to gain relatively little
I do not want to allow this to become too much of a cri@@ tique
This is to be expected and is healthy in a democracy
This is the only way in which we can hope to wield some power and influence over the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference
Nevertheless , we must acknowledge that , in the Convention , all issues have been discussed openly , frankly and fairly
We cannot have closed issues and nor must obstacles be thrown in the way of the debate
The peoples of the current and future Member States demand and deserve this
Let us speak , however , in practical terms
What is at stake here ?
Everything , then , is at stake and rightly so , because this is how debates should be undertaken
what sort of Europe do we want to build ?
To this end we need to define this European model in political terms
This task is the responsibility as well as the duty of everyone
We have confidence in the peoples of Europe and therefore believe in a Europe that means greater democracy and not the opposite , which is greater bureaucracy
We have confidence in diversity and we therefore believe in a Europe that respects the traditions of its Member States , preserves their cultural heritage and safeguards their respective languages
I shall conclude by saying that the obvious target of the Commission 's contribution to the debate here is the Convention
This is , furthermore , our duty
Mr President , not unexpectedly , the Commission is proposing that it be given more power
The European Parliament and the EU 's prime ministers are also ag@@ itating to be given more power
It is not difficult to foresee the compromise at the Rome Summit in December of next year
The prime ministers scarcely wish to relinquish foreign and security policy , so they will choose someone from the European Council to represent the EU to the outside world
They may , for example , get Tony Blair to become the EU 's first president and then make Mr Aznar President of the next Commission
The Commission may also be given increased executive powers , and Mr Aznar 's leadership become a proper government that stands accountable
In return , the European Parliament will see the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure abolished and so be given more power over expenditure
It will also see common decision-making extended to include more areas and so be given greater influence over legislation
The EU 's prime ministers are being given more power and the Commission is being strengthened , as is the European Parliament
They are left with less democracy , every time that more supranational and undemocratic power is handed out in the EU
That , however , is a biased approach
Let us take the case of the monopoly of initiative that the Commission is proposing to consolidate and to extend to the whole of what it calls the legislative domain
Why should 20 commissioners have a better understanding of Europe 's general interest than all of the governments within the Council ?
Admittedly , it is said that each government protects its national interest , but their debate makes it possible to go beyond that
each consumer protects his own selfish interest , but nevertheless , all their transactions set prices which provide the best general approach
The Commission , with its monopoly of initiative , therefore finds itself in the position of a pl@@ ann@@ er who claims to know prices better than the market
In a world of openness , freedom and democracy , this is unacceptable
In our opinion , we must reform it by taking an overview of the institutions
In any case , it seemed that the recent debate within the Convention on the Commission 's monopoly of initiative was drawn to a close even before it had started
Let us hope , Mr President , that the Commission 's new document will have the unforeseen effect of re-@@ launching the debate
Let us talk of a Constitution
I also believe , Mr Prodi , that what you have said here , what your communication seeks - efficiency , democracy and clarity - are good objectives
I believe that for these to be at the forefront of our considerations is a good thing
So is the idea of double legitimacy , although I believe we must give this some careful thought
In Maastricht we introduced the concept of European citizenship , and we must therefore begin to talk about European citizens as subjects of the European Union
The Community method , however , also means something which I learned many years ago from a person who I admired , É@@ mile No@@ el , which is institutional balance
Therefore , the debate is an open one
If you will allow me to use the expression , there is a ' free bar ' in terms of considering constitutional models
I believe we must consider whether it is in the Commission 's interest to be elected by the European Parliament and to be able to be dissolved by the Council
I therefore believe we should give this some consideration
In any event , Mr Prodi , I believe that this is a good document
You have done what you had to do and we are going to debate it in the Convention
On the other hand , let me tell you something which I did not like , which is the famous Pen@@ el@@ ope text which you mentioned earlier
My friend , Mr Barón , spoke about Pen@@ el@@ ope , the wife of Ul@@ ys@@ ses
I believe that by bringing out this text at the same as your declaration , you have not done yourselves a political favour
Today everybody is talking about this Pen@@ el@@ ope project and nobody is talking about the good document you have presented
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , we have been calling for a Commission proposal to solve the institutional problems that exist
Your paper makes a further interesting and important contribution to the work of the Convention , but it does not provide a total solution for all institutional problems
It does cast some light on the Commission 's position regarding a whole raft of issues
For example , majority voting in the Council as a general rule , which we welcome
Maj@@ ority voting by Parliament on legislation as a general rule , which we also welcome
And there is much more besides
I can see many positive points in your proposals
However , in some areas , Mr Prodi , your proposals do not make things clearer - they just create greater confusion
This is the issue of the appointment and political responsibility of the Commission
You are suggesting that the European Parliament should elect the President of the Commission
That is a good proposal , and a much-needed step forward
This means building in a permanent compromise , rather like the permanent grand coalition in Austria
The second issue is that the European Council is to confirm the election of the President of the Commission by the European Parliament
What do you have in mind ?
And if the Council does not confirm the President , what then ?
Does Parliament have the right to dis@@ solve the Council ?
Your proposals do not include any mechanisms for resolving conflicts
Ultimately , and this really takes the biscuit , the Commission is accountable to both Parliament and the Council
So how will that work out in practice ?
Will you resign every time ?
If Parliament says that it has confidence in you , will you stay , and if the Council says you must resign , will you resign ?
What sort of message does that send about building the institutions of the European Union ?
It is simply a recipe for confusion
Mr President , today , on behalf of the European Commission , President Prodi set out a position of great political and institutional importance
firstly , Europe has to become a global political power
The new position of Secretary of the Union for Foreign Affairs would represent a strong Europe , able to set out its position in international bodies through a single representative
Mr President , you are aware of my personal desire to see faster work and a substantial increase in the quality of our capabilities in the area of defence
Other institutional figures , lacking a clearly defined role and which would undermine the unity of representation abroad , must not interfere with the government of the Union
I would add that we must strive to combat corruption and promote the pluralism of information
Mr President , in the position he adopted on this issue , Mr Prodi was a strong advocate of the Community method , which is the federation method
He also represented opportunism on a large scale
If you swe@@ ar by the Community method you are not supposed to suggest that the Council has a right to dismiss the Commission
To use President Prodi 's own language , the proposal is stupid - stup@@ ide
The Commissioners are a collection of civil servants who do not need to inspire parliamentary confidence
If there are abuses they must be penalised just like other civil servants
The Commission wants to increase its power at the expense of political decision-makers
It was unclear as to whether the earlier proposal to grant the Commissioners unequal status is to remain in force
If it is , it means the EU would have its own ' Pol@@ it@@ bur@@ o ' , consisting , one assumes , of representatives of the big countries
From the point of view of the small countries , that is not democracy
The Commission 's demand to withdraw the system of consensual decision-making , or Member States ' right of veto , is an attack on the Member States
The right of veto is the last defence against supranational , unequal systems of decision-making under the Community method
Those representing the Commission in the Convention 's working group have been milit@@ arising the Union and creating a new European legal area in which there would be Euro-@@ law and Euro-@@ order
The Commission is calling for the common foreign and security policy to come under its control , with competence to be transferred from the Member States to the Commission
We must not allow the last vesti@@ ges of Member State independence to be crushed
There is already a federal currency
The federal army will commence operations next year
Federal law and order are being got ready
The federalists are over-represented in the Convention on the constitution of the EU
Member States should not approve draft proposals for a federation drawn up by the Commission or the Convention simply as they are
We must not make compromises over the Commission 's status as a body of civil servants as opposed to a political government
Mr Prodi , power wiel@@ ded by the Commission is not democracy
You are a servant , who has now adopted a position on matters that are the business of your masters
That is one of the important features of the situation as it ob@@ tains at the moment
I welcome a lot of what he has said today about the way the Commission should take office and hold office
That is a good feature of his proposals
Another point that picks up what Mr Poettering said and which nobody else has spoken of is that a European democracy must be a democracy at many levels
Mr Napoletano has prepared a report today to the Constitutional Affairs Committee of this Parliament
We have amended it in committee and we believe that we have strengthened it
This debate is premature and you are , I am sure , launching it because the Commission has a gun held to its head
He himself and other Members have mentioned the name of Jean Monnet
Now , I believe that there is a fundamental difference between Jean Monnet 's work and the proposal before us today
There are some differences between the two cases , I feel
We will see in the coming days
That means that all it would take is for the Mr Po@@ et@@ ter@@ ings and the Mr Barón C@@ res@@ pos of the future to meet in private and
I particularly appreciate the fact that in the key areas the Community method has been adopted as the guiding principle
I see this as running counter to Mon@@ tes@@ quie@@ u 's division of powers
It creates a confusion of executive and legislative roles , a muddle that is really the opposite of transparency and accountability
The right to dismiss the Commission by a two-thirds majority also remains , but now we are also supposed to elect the President of the Commission by a two-thirds majority
That is a total repudi@@ ation of the role of this House - the European Parliament is being em@@ ascul@@ ated
I regard this as a very difficult situation
It does not seem the right approach to me to allow the Commission President alone not to take part in such a discussion about possible dismissal
I would therefore urge the Commission to reconsider this very carefully , especially as it is extraordinarily weak on such a key issue
The key issue facing the Convention is whether the Council , in its role as legislator , is a legislative Council , with a second chamber that meets in public
The Commission 's response to that is that this proposal should be examined
I would have expected the Commission to formulate a clear position on that point
That is why I regard this proposal on such a vital issue as being highly questionable
The struggles for power and for the social face of Europe have now really broken out
And with more power for the European Council , as some want , we will of course be breaking the balance between the institutions
That means the triumph of the back-@@ room politics of the big countries , and this will have a paralysing effect
This is the best guarantee for small and medium-sized Member States such as the Netherlands that their interests count too
At the same time we can make effective European policy
Consider migration and in particular the Vitorino proposals
And at the same time , the struggle over the choice of whether or not we have a social Europe
Conservative , free-market thinking Europe , even here in the European Parliament , refuses to anchor the European social model as a task in the European constitution
And it is precisely on this that citizens , social organisations and we as social democrats want to do battle , because it goes to the heart of the matter
Convention , seize your opportunity
The new constitutional engineering work can only be based on in-depth , responsible dialogue between the representatives of the European and national institutions
The new Europe , founded on the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity , must be politically strong and have economic credibility
To this end , we need to give it a single voice in foreign policy
It must be a federation of nation States but not an interfering Super@@ state
Of course , the principle of the six-monthly rotation of the Presidency of the Union will have to be changed
The Europe we are building cannot afford to lose its Jud@@ a@@ e@@ o-@@ Christian roots , which are the guarantee of the secul@@ arity of the institution
I would ask you all to cooperate and to concentrate on the debate until the start of voting time
Thank you too for your proposals regarding the appointment of your successors and of the Commission 's three-stage appointment procedure
I have a question to ask , however
Consequently , the positions that you adopt regarding the Secretary of the Union will be regarded enthusiastically and be reproduced in other sectors
You say that the president of the Council could not seek compromise at the same time as making proposals
We all know many assemblies where these two roles are carried out by the same person
Mr President , I thank you for calling our fellow Members to order
Mr President , Mr Prodi can indeed understand me , because I am sitting right beside him , so we can communicate fairly easily
I wanted to start by complimenting the Commission President on the excellent document that has been presented
First of all I am pleased that Mr Prodi does not favour a President of the European Union as Mr Giscard d' Estaing has proposed
We mainly see the President of the European Union in the role of President of the Commission
These two positions must coincide as far as possible
If there is to be a President of the European Union , then it must be the President of the Commission
For example , one for foreign policy , that could be Mr Solana 's role
If you divide the work up in this way , then the President of the Commission will have rather more freedom to take on these presidential duties
We are also very pleased with the emphasis on the Community method and that there are proposals for legislative simplification
There are good proposals for this in the Convention , that go a little further than what the Commission has proposed
We think that in the future there should really only be talk of regulations , of directives , of decisions and of the implementing legislation and that will be enough
And that as far as possible everything must be done by way of codecision
Finally , we are also pleased that the Commission has not put forward the absurd idea of a Congress
We think this Congress a bad idea
This is what the Commission is proposing
Consequently , Mr Prodi , you have our full support
President Prodi , I agree with what Mrs Maij-Weggen said just now
The communication you have presented to us is extremely interesting and is broadly compatible with the positions of the European Parliament
I welcome the proposal to generalise the Community method , codecision and majority voting
I welcome the idea of a single spokesman for foreign policy , who is part of the Commission but is personally accountable to the Council too
Mr President , I do not think it is yet entirely clear how long what the Commission has proposed actually is
I have read a document running to 23 pages
Mrs Kaufmann thought just now that there were more than a hundred , so I do not know how things are precisely , but those 23 pages are very interesting
They contain relatively little on socio-economic issues , and , as for what they do contain , I do rather wonder whether we might agree with it
I would just like to say a word about open coordination
This is a particularly thorny problem in the Treaty at the moment and it is actually poorly provided for
And what does the Commission say ?
This is of course quite impossible
If the Commission wants to crush open coordination at some time , then I think this is how they must do it
One of the three institutions on which this Community is based cannot simply be disregarded in this way on such an important issue
That is the principal message
The second message is that in general the social element in the Convention has so far had rather too little attention paid to it
It is very fortunate that a working group has now been set up with particular concern for the social issue
There is one major difference between the two parties , the PPE-DE on the one hand and the socialists on the other , and this difference is where you start
This is important if we are to bring this to a successful conclusion
Mr President , I welcome the Commission 's intention to make the EU the first supranational democracy in the world
That is a fantastic project , and people understand it and support it
The present approach is really top@@ sy@@ -@@ tur@@ vy , and I think that we need to reinstate Mon@@ tes@@ quie@@ u 's principles
This is a really important point , and one where Parliament and the Commission can now pull in the same direction
I would also like to congratulate you on clearly advocating that there should be just one executive and not two
There cannot be an elected President of the European Council alongside the elected President of the Commission
We must get that through in the Convention
Mr President , I will be very brief , not least because we are behind schedule and the European Parliament needs to continue its work with all speed
I will just make a few brief points , the first of which is addressed to Mr Barón Crespo
We have been looking into the problems in Galicia very carefully and are continuing to do so
Commissioner de Palacio has already visited the area , Commissioner Wallström is going there tomorrow and Commissioner Fischler has already recommended the measures that should be taken
Most importantly , we are summon@@ ing and coordinating all our resources so as to be able to take the broadest , most cohesive action possible
We can confirm that , in our opinion , this incident could and should have been avoided
We must therefore address this matter as thoroughly as possible because , if similar incidents occur in the future , it will be our responsibility
The Commission has already put pressure on the Member States to limit the circulation of obsolete vessels , and we will continue to work on that
The points on which there is dissent are extremely important points which we will have to discuss
I will not go into specific points because I know you are pushed for time
I can confirm that the Commission intends to propose that the Charter be integrated into the future Constitution
Indeed , we have already proposed this in the feasibility study I commissioned , and we demonstrated that it is entirely feasible
It is a feasibility study which is an extremely useful working document
I feel this has been an important opportunity to develop the debate on the future of Europe
The next item is the vote
Mr President , I would like to propose some amendments to the Minutes
That will be recorded in today 's Minutes
Mr President , this has been voted on and I have no problem with that , but I had asked for the floor
Are these amendments going to be voted on or not ?
Amendments Nos 4 and 17 are not going to be voted on because the President has ruled them inadmissible
In his view they belong more in the explanatory statement than in the legislative text
I have here a letter from the President saying that Amendments Nos 4 and 17 have been deemed inadmissible
What the services have told us is that they were admissible and that they would be voted on
I take note of your formal protest but the amendments remain inadmissible
For clarity , as the rapporteur rightly says , we will vote on the reworded version of Amendment No 4
Mr President , you told me that Amendment No 4 was inadmissible and then it has been voted on because an agreement had been reached
The Commission is trying to realise its proposal , which is to withdraw an article , and we have voted to include that article
This article should be voted on
Let me read out what the President ruled
He deemed Amendment No 4 inadmissible in its present form
The only thing the President says in his letter about Amendment No 17 is ' I declare this amendment inadmissible '
He is not saying that in any modified form it could be accepted
Rapporteur , I owe you an apology
I have just been told there is a ty@@ po@@ graphical error
The President meant to say that he now declares this amendment admissible
O@@ kay , I resign
Mr President , I do not want this to be a dispute between a Galician and a Scotsman , nor between two Europeans
I am rapporteur for these reports , I am a professional lawyer and I am producing a legal and political report
I have been in contact with the services and they have told us that this amendment is admissible
Therefore , all I ask is that the vote be taken a little more slowly , please
The vote was suspended at 11
Mr President , fisheries are only the subject of discussion in Parliament once every twenty years
I do so , Mr President , as a Galician in particular , because Galicia is currently experiencing a great tragedy
I shall end by saying that I would like Mr Fischler to be present at this historic moment and he is not here
My justification for this is as follows
On 14 November we submitted a motion for a resolution to the administration
I have here the electronic record confirming its transmission
Therefore our original motion has priority
In accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure , a subsequently tabled joint motion for a resolution replaces the original motion
That means that the subsequently tabled joint motion is regarded as that submitted first and should be put to the vote first
As the content of the joint motion for a resolution tabled by these groups is exactly the same as those amendments , only one of the two can be admissible
It does not make sense for us to follow the voting list , because we would then have to vote on the same content twice
That is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Rules of Procedure
Mr President , I would specifically like to support this proposal on behalf of my group
There is every justification for proceeding in this way
We amended the Minutes this morning , so that this House 's Minutes now say that the PPE-DE Group 's motion was tabled first
I would , however , urge you , Mr President , to let this House decide
Mr President , I believe that we are currently playing a game of cat and mouse in this Chamber which is atrocious , utterly atrocious for democracy
Everyone knows that as soon as ?
In@@ tel@@ ligence does not come automatically purely by virtue of size
No , and you too , Mr Schulz , please calm down , ?
The requests before us are clear
I see no point in extending the debate
I looked into the chronological order in which resolutions were received
My decision with regard to the order in which we should vote is based only and wholly on the chronological order and the precedents that surround that
I am now informed that the chronological order indicates that we will vote on the joint resolution tabled by the three groups first
Mo@@ tion for a resolution tabled by Di@@ ana Wallis and A@@ stri@@ d Thors on behalf of the ELDR Group , on the Statute for Members
Mo@@ tion for a resolution tabled by Hei@@ di Ann@@ el@@ i Hautala and others on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group , on the Statute for Members
Mo@@ tion for a resolution tabled by Franc@@ is Wurtz on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group , on the Statute for Members of the European Parliament
Mr President , we need to change this amendment so that it better reflects the realities of the Treaty of Nice
I would ask that the last two words be deleted and that you accept that as an oral amendment
Mr President , I do not wish to reopen a debate which this Parliament has already had but you were elected on a programme for reform of this House
Mr President , you thought you were right to follow the procedure you adopted
On behalf of my group , I would like to say that we did not agree with your decision , but I do not want to dwell on that
I asked to speak because Mr Watson did
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the reaction in this Chamber , the enormous support for what I have just said , is enough
I do not need to add anything else
Mr President , my group respects the other groups
Now is a time for unity and implementing the Rules of Procedure
I do not want to take any more contributions
I want to make one brief comment
We have adopted a resolution today
The resolution gives what I would call an indicative status to the opinion that Mr Rothley has brought to the Committee on Legal Affairs
As rapporteur , Mr Rothley said yesterday that he hopes in the course of next year - perhaps by March 2003 - to move it from indicative to definitive
I would like to draw attention to the need for the Community legislation on PD@@ O and P@@ G@@ I products to be revised
I am therefore going to send a letter to the Italian Permanent Represen@@ tation in Brussels to call upon Italy to adopt a clear position on this issue in the Council
I will send the letter to the Italian Members of Parliament too and invite them to support the initiative
it concerns the protection of all European typical products
I therefore call upon the non-@@ Italian Members as well to see this as a question of the legal protection of typical products
There should therefore be safeguards to ensure that the voice of local institutional bodies is heard in these situations
In Portugal , this problem has already arisen , in the case of ' Lim@@ i@@ ano ' cheese
In an ever lar@@ ger@@ -scale market , the production of age-old regional food and drink products is at risk
They can lose out to competition from a place where production costs are lower
If the free market strikes , cheese , wine , mu@@ st@@ ard , v@@ ine@@ gar and cake will soon no longer come from the region of origin
Yet we have to be careful that no new injustice arises
Under this arrangement old EU Member States are at an advantage compared with new ones
I have recently put questions to the Commission about Bulgarian fe@@ ta cheese that can no longer be exported now that the name fe@@ ta is given only to Greek products
The Bulgarian cheese now has to be sold under an unknown name and is therefore less in demand
This mechanism has helped to make the agri-@@ food sector more dynamic and to preserve traditional production methods , providing consumers with high quality products
I welcome the Commission proposal to adapt this system , especially as regards continuing to monitor counterfeiting and unlawful im@@ itations , both within the EU and in third countries
I also agree that the owner of a trademark should , in certain circumstances , have the right to register their trade@@ marked product with a PD@@ O or a P@@ G@@ I
The overall aim is regionalisation via a uniform Community approach
A development I cannot support as a sovereign@@ ist
The regulation will put unnecessary restrictions on producers in particular affecting small and medium sized producers of agricultural products
The consumer should be able to support home production , if this is their wish
Finally it is unjustifiable that LDCs should live up to EU production standards
This constitutes a hidden trade barrier
This Report was voted on under Rule 110a of the Rules of Procedure which allows for no debate in Parliament and no amendments to the Report
The British Delegation of the PPE-DE Group has previously sought to amend reports which it did not support
The new Rule , however , leaves no option but to abstain on certain reports
We will need , in future , to monitor the specific effects of these new developments
Our focus must be on implementing measures rather than on drafting guidelines
The appropriate involvement of all the interested institutions and partners such as the Council , the European Parliament and the social partners , must be ensured
We must stress the importance of strengthening the democratic legitimacy of this process and of giving Parliament powers of participation and co-decision in the entire cycle of policy coordination
To this end , we hope that the Convention proposes this improvement for the new Treaty
This report backs the Commission , which defends the idea of greater coordination in implementing the economic policy and the so-called employment policy of the Member States
The only ' economic policy ' that the European Union and its Member States know , however , consists of constantly favouring the interests of businesses and their owners
We constantly hear of plans for mass redundancies
And you dare to speak of ' employment policy '
By voting against this report , we are therefore reaffirming our rejection of your capitalist system
It is on this issue that the rapporteur attempts to somewhat improve the unacceptable position maintained by the European Commission , which systematically overlooks the social and environmental spheres
Therefore , despite the fact that a few individual aspects can be seen as positive , we have voted against this report
In 2000 , the European Summit in Lisbon spoke out in favour of a tough liberalisation policy and comprehensive privatisation of public services
According to this line of thinking , the expected drawbacks concerning labour and the environment are automatically offset by an increase in profits and employment
The proposal that is being voted on today is a commendable effort on the part of Mr Karas to give a wrong policy choice a friendly tw@@ ist
He has managed this to some extent in the area of the environment , at least as far as the good intentions are concerned
The rapporteur is trying to reconcile the irreconcilable in a somewhat craf@@ tier manner
It is not so much his friendly intentions as the underlying policy that is being condon@@ ed in this way
This has prompted me and my group to vote against this proposal
The opposite is happening , however
We believe that the sole objective of this sort of ' coordination ' is to mislead the workers
Over the course of time , flying has become ever cheaper , and is , in many cases , also cheap in relation to the distance covered
This is because the environmental and social costs are not passed on to the passengers
There is no tax on fuel and the routes taken require no infrastructure outside the airports
Despite the low fares , which cannot compensate for the negative effects on air pollution and noise , there is still a political majority in favour of yet lower fares
Is it a political priority to reduce the travel expenses of the highest paid ?
The compromise that has been reached between the parliamentary majority and the Council stipulates that the authorities should cover some of the security costs entailed by the fight against terrorism
This money would be better spent on mass public transport , namely city transport and local transport , which is experiencing cutbacks everywhere
This is why I reject this compromise
These are at present inadequate statutory forms of redress for such infringement at both ports and airports
This is often reflected in constituency cases
In the light of September 11 , the Foster report is a strong contribution to the security of all EU citizens
Mr President , I just am registering that I abstained on the Thorning-Schmidt report
That was the reason for abstention
We gained some things for industry but lost some for the music and entertainment business
Noise at work can cause effects such as fati@@ gue , communication difficulties and total hearing loss
Implementation of this directive will thus lead to a significant reduction in existing noise levels and , therefore , an improvement in working conditions
Lastly , workers must be made aware of the problem and be trained in the right way to use the equipment
It is indeed a worrying and all too frequent cause of occupational health problems
I think the directive under consideration meets our legitimate expectations for improvements in working conditions
For that reason , we voted today in favour of improving Mr Jové Peres 's text in various ways
That does need testing in a legal way and not just by political debate in the Parliament
I would like to take some steps to push that forward
This is not a particularly one-@@ country point
It appears however , according to professionals and scientists , that only certain species need to be protected
Furthermore , I wish to reiterate the express demand of the ' Fri@@ ends of Fishing Group ' to see strict controls applied to industrial fishing
84 % of the Community budget , in order to modernise and make the fleet safer , particularly the small-scale fishing fleet
To sum up , I shall say that , once again , I am surprised by the European logic which prevails in the area of common policy
If we follow the Commission 's unilateral approach to sustainable development , that will be the best solution to enable fish populations to recover
there are simply not enough fisheries resources
The abolition of State aid for building new boats and for modernising the existing fleet is unacceptable
The amendments make positive changes to the Commission 's proposal , so that the socio-economic dimension of the fishing industry is no longer forgotten
I shall be voting in favour of the text thus amended
First , since the opportunities open to fishermen in these regions have shrunk , it is vital to expand them by increasing the exclusive fishing area to 50 miles
Secondly , this is also a way of ensuring the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fish stocks in the seas of the outermost regions
I therefore welcome Parliament 's adoption of this important measure for the outermost regions and also the PPE-DE 's vote in its favour , which was decisive in its success
The dwindling fish stocks at sea as a result of environmental pollution and overfishing are alarming
Cat@@ ch quotas and even catch bans are becoming inevitable
This mainly applies to Spain and Portugal
Their interests often lead to the problem being denied , or continued scientific research
The main purpose of this research is to do nothing for the time being and delay the finding of a solution
My colleague , Mr Jové Peres has tried to take these conflicting interests into consideration and to bring them into line with each other
There is one point in his approach to which I object
He is trying to shift the decision about catch quotas from the Commission to the Council
This is beneficial for an obstructive Member State but makes necessary radical interventions more difficult
The Commission seems to envisage a common fisheries policy that focuses more on the short-term interests of the Member States than on the interests of the fishermen
The time has come for the CFP to try to keep fish@@ ing-@@ dependent regions alive and not to turn this issue into a battle@@ ground for the Member States
Fishermen share common interest@@ s; they all need the fish stocks to pursue their professional activities
The decisions and objectives of the recovery plans must not underestimate the consequences they may have
The recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery or conservation of fish stocks and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry
Mr President , regarding the Varela report on structural assistance , we rejected the report because it aims to keep the current structure of CFP subsidies
The subsidies system has helped to drive over-capacity of the EU fleet
This is unacceptable and that is why we rejected the Varela structural assistance report
Yet there is one question which nobody is asking
How many of the fish that you claim to be saving will die in the next ' Prestige ' oil-@@ tanker disaster ?
How many others , day after day , are dying as a result of illegal emissions from the un@@ sea@@ worthy old tu@@ bs char@@ tered by the big oil companies ?
Of course the authorities announce major decisions , such as prohibiting the use of single-hull vessels
and then they give the oil companies ten years to comply
In other words , a genuine fisheries policy is not just about adopting rules on fish stocks
It is also about an economic activity with a very strong social impact , and we must not forget that
The amendments are along these lines , and it is therefore the amended form of this text that will receive my vote in favour
Policies so far have managed to reduce the number of vessels , especially coastal fishing vessels , hitting small family businesses hard and driving people out of this profession
The objective is to shift fisheries into the hands of large companies
At the same time , the aim is to develop the fish farming sector during the course of overall increases in the production of all types of aquaculture products
It is crucial that public aid for the renewal of the fleet should be maintained
I therefore want to give the rapporteur my unequivocal support
I consider that addressing the shortage of fish stocks is not just a question of scrapping vessels
Funds for modernising the existing fleet cannot simply be redirected to scrapping vessels , thus bringing into question already adopted budgetary measures that will be in force until 2006
Reducing the fleet is perfectly compatible with maintaining public aid
We cannot , however , hide our heads in the sand
Regulatory measures are needed to prevent public aid from leading to an increase in fleet capacity
This balance , however , must be based on a fair assessment of all the elements involved
It is therefore absolutely unacceptable that it should now attempt to blindly implement an across-the-board reduction in assistance for fleet restructuring and renewal
We believe the report to support re-@@ directing structural funds in 2004 to 2006 to help reduce the size of the fleet on a voluntary basis
The report suggests that any emergency Community measure would need additional funding up to 2006
This is not logical because it proposes extra funding for scrapping at the same time as providing subsidies for improving efficiency of the existing vessels or even building new ones
It does not respect the precautionary principle
Although not perfect , most scientific evidence suggests that many stocks are in danger of collapse and are being over-@@ fished by an EU fleet that is too big
I support Mr
These proposals are flawed and will not achieve the aim of sustainable development
This view is shared by a majority of the Member States
The Commission also makes a calculation of the budgetary estimates for the financing of these proposals which lacks any logic
The Commission 's estimates are based on pure sup@@ positions , with no solid foundation
The Commission itself acknowledges that they are only probable working hypotheses
This is a totally unacceptable way of dealing with this extremely important issue
Since the report is in line with these comments , I shall vote in favour of it
The Varela report is highly critical of the Commission 's proposal
The only data that the Commission presents in this proposal for a regulation establishing an emergency measure for scrapping fishing vessels are just rough figures
These data on the fishing fleet have been considered unrealistic and , in many cases , wrong by most of the Member States
The Member States have already earmarked these funds for other purposes , and so they are unlikely to be willing to accept this reallocation
Serious funding difficulties are therefore likely to arise in the context of such an unrealistic programme as this
A report as clear as this one certainly deserves my vote
I broadly welcome the positive work done by the rapporteur , and the way I voted reflects my complete solidarity with the Portuguese positions on this subject
R@@ ich Europe has Africa , the poorest continent , on its doorstep
This continent , with its many fatal diseases , poorly-@@ developed industry , desertification and battle for minerals , is selling its agricultural products and mining products to the rich world
In the past , during colonial supremacy , this was done under du@@ ress
Nowadays , it appears to be done voluntarily , although they are hardly given any alternatives
Politically speaking , colonialism has died out , but economically speaking , it is still thriving
This also applies to fishing , and increasingly so
For the poor countries , this is one way of making a fast buck , but offers no solutions in the long run
If the seas in those areas soon run out of fish stocks , as the North Sea is doing , those countries will be left with an insoluble problem
They , in fact , desperately need food from the sea for their own undernourished population , and they could export any surpluses
Instead of this , they confine themselves to primitive coastal fishing and sell their fishing rights to others
This situation should end without delay
This is the reason why I am increasingly averse to endorsing the extension of agreements such as those for Senegal and Angola today
Mr President , with regard to this particular resolution , let me say I am appalled at the opportun@@ ist hypocrisy of certain groups and certain individuals in this House
I totally agree with the comments of my colleague , Mr Poettering , when he criticised them for setting themselves up as the cust@@ odi@@ ans of morality in this House
those Members that complain about the current system are not obliged to take travel expenses
They can go to the cash office and get reimbursement of travel expenses
If they think it is a wrong system they should practise what they are preach
To their credit , some Members , especially Dutch Members , only take the reimbursement of the tickets
Mr President , I am speaking on behalf of an alliance of opportun@@ ists and hypo@@ cr@@ ites
On behalf of the European Parliamentary Labour Party , I wish to say that we are strong supporters of a Member Statute being introduced before the 2004 European Parliamentary elections
Because of that , the British Labour delegation voted for the EL@@ D@@ R@@ /@@ Green@@ /@@ GUE/NGL resolution
The PPE-@@ DE@@ /@@ PSE resolution supports the existing text from the Legal Affairs Committee and that involves contentious primary legislation which is not acceptable to Council and therefore almost certain to fail
The text does not make clear the requirement for there to be complete and transparent reform of all Members ' expenses
This is not a position , in all friendship to our colleagues in the PSE , which we are able to accept
The PPE-@@ DE@@ /@@ PSE resolution also calls on the Commission to give an opinion on the text of the Legal Affairs Committee before it has been discussed by us in plenary
This seems to the British Labour delegation a recipe for further delay
It will be fundamentally our problem and our responsibility
1 - that the pay of a Member of Parliament should be no higher than that of a qualified work@@ er;
2 - that it should be possible for elected representatives to be removed from office at any time by the people who elected them
The Commission is consulted and the Council must agree to the statute
I voted for a fair statute for all Members which must go hand in hand with a fair , honest and open expenses regime
Moreover , MEPs are elected in national contexts
Therefore , they are , and should continue to be , linked to these national contexts
Members of any parliament are not elected to give undue preference to themselves , but to represent the electorate
In response to the criticism of preferential treatment , a statute for MEPs was discussed in 1998 and in 2002
Unfortunately , some MEPs speak in favour of such a statute in order to validate and enhance their benefits
Special attention needs to be given to the situation of the most vulnerable people , such as women and children
According to an estimate by the International Organization for Migration , trafficking in human beings affects between 700 000 and two million women and children throughout the world every year
This is a means of strengthening the instruments for combating illegal immigration and the trafficking in human beings
the European Union must stop illegal immigration
Every year , between 700 000 and 2 million people , mostly women and children , are the victims of trafficking in human beings
Worldwide , trafficking in human beings is the third biggest source of illegal income , after arms trafficking and drugs trafficking
It generates profits of between USD 5 and 7 billion dollars a year
The current rate of trafficking in children is now ten times higher than that of the transatlantic slave trade at its peak
This particular form of trafficking is forced labour , and it is the one that is growing most rapidly
Trafficking in human beings is a scourge which affects every part of the globe , and it is taking on alarming proportions in the wake of globalisation
Organised crime very quickly achieved the huge profits that could be made from taking advantage of the distress of w@@ oul@@ d-@@ be immigrants
It is more interested , in fact , in combating illegal immigration than in protecting the victims
The rapporteur tries to make some distinction , but only partially and without drawing all the conclusions from this
The State should not resort to the threat of expulsion to pressur@@ ise victims into cooperating with the police and the authorities in charge of the investigation
We therefore voted against the report
Whilst the British Conservative Delegation is in favour of prosecuting those who smugg@@ le human beings , this measure is not an effective way of dealing with such criminals
By allowing illegal immigrants to stay in a Member State , although ostensibly for prosecution purposes , the directive would leave the asylum system open to abuse
If this legislation were to be implemented , the problems would be exacerbated
Instead , we need to tackle these matters as individual states and take tougher measures to discourage traffickers and bogus asylum seekers
We approve the principle of giving protection to the victims of networks trafficking in human beings
However , the Commission 's proposal is perverse in its duplic@@ ity
To grant a renewable six-month temporary residence permit to illegal immigrants who would help the authorities of Member States to combat the il@@ leg@@ al-@@ immigration networks is totally unsatisfactory
This measure , as proposed , will do nothing to put an end to the vicious circle of illegal immigration
Victims will remain under the control of the networks and mafias
We cannot fall short of these minimum requirements
I voted against the report
We agree that there are advantages in the EU 's adopting rules on short-term residence permits with a view to combating organised illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings
In tracking and punishing crime , we should not tackle the victims but the perpetrators
It is unfortunate that those proposals - at any rate , the compromises she is defending - still appear inadequate
We do not want to carry any of the responsibility for a scheme that raises people 's hopes but offers inadequate protection
In addition , the establishment of this special measure is conditional upon real cooperation of the victim with the national authorities , with a view to dismantling illegal immigration networks
This will certainly avoid the use of other means to obtain rights that would otherwise be inaccessible
The President of the Commission made things worse when he replied to the various speakers at the end of the debate
it does not , even to the slightest extent , initiate a review of the Stability Pact and the politic@@ al-@@ economic and political objectives that lie behind it;
it certainly does not question the liberalisation processes agreed upon by the Lisbon and Barcelona European Coun@@ cil@@ s;
it does not criticise the ' employment ' policy based on flexibility and the increasing insecurity of work;
enlargement , strengthening security and stability , and the economy
On enlargement , the main preoccupation is the restricted integration of the Community acquis in the name of the single market
What the new Member States need , however , is solidarity , democracy and public services
On security and stability , in the name of the dogmatic fight against terrorism , the Commission will continue with its plans to destroy freedom and to criminalise immigrants
In addition , the European Union 's policy on the Middle East , to seek a fair and lasting peace , has not produced much in the way of results
A different policy is needed , one that is based on opening up of borders , combating dictatorships , abolishing tax havens and supporting of oppressed peoples
The Europe that the Commission is building is not the Europe that its citizens want
I voted against this programme
Mr President , the December Council of fisheries ministers will have a hefty agenda in terms of agreeing the first package of CFP reform proposals
Last week , the Commission tabled drastic quota proposals
These proposals were more inspired by practical political considerations than by justified concern for poor cod levels
Instead of a ban on cod fishing and industrial fishing , the Commission would like to restrict minimal additional cod fishing by the Dutch flat@@ fish fleet
We would regard an approach of this kind as fighting a losing battle
Fish stock management and the corresponding quota rely on the catches being registered effectively
After a debacle in the 1980s , this registration is virtually watertight in the Netherlands
Of the fish supplied , 99 % is registered and traded via fish auctions
How can one of the larger Member States export twice as many fish as supplied by the fishermen according to the registrations ?
The Jové Peres report is right to call for effective control and harmonised sanctions
It is high time we did something about this
Member States that fish within the quotas not only on paper but also in reality are now being hit hardest
T@@ ests are carried out on animals for military purposes and in the production of cosmetics and medicines
According to the rapporteur , seven Member States , including the Netherlands , fail to implement the existing directive on the protection of animals for experiments and other scientific purposes
Unfortunately , this is not yet legislation in the true sense of the word , but an attempt to invite the Commission to take an initiative
Unfortunately , unlike other parliaments , this Parliament cannot reach a decision without cooperation
either we can use animals for experimental and other scientific purposes , or we can use human beings
We made a fully informed choice to use animals to further the progress of science and to create modern medicine , which has invented antibiotics and vaccines
Let us therefore say yes to the abolition of tests on animals , where alternative methods are authorised or when there are species threatened with extinction
The rapporteur 's proposals are unacceptable
By voting against this report , we are not neglecting the interests of animals , but we are instead safeguarding the interests of human beings
Let us not allow animals to take precedence over human beings and human health
That concludes the explanations of vote
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament
Colleagues , I have great pleasure today on behalf of the European Parliament to welcome Mr Ale@@ j@@ and@@ ro Toledo , President of the Republic of Peru
We met at the protocol entrance and it is bitterly cold outside this morning
I assured the President that the welcome for him in this Parliament is very warm indeed
Mr President , your election on 3 June 2001 marked a new departure in the political life of your country and a step towards democratic consolidation
I know that even before you took office you expressed a keen interest in strengthening the existing ties between Peru and the European Union
So we are especially pleased that you are here today and indeed this week
This in our Parliament and in the life of our old continent and of our European Union is a very important moment
We are approaching the closing moment in a lengthy process of enlarging our union to take in many more Member States
At this time , as you may imagine , we are consumed by this activit@@ y; it is so complex and so demanding
Your presence here today recalls to us the duty to think beyond intro@@ spec@@ tion and to touch the wider world
I am also aware of your interest in international humanitarian funds to try to mitigate the impact of poverty and the declaration of Gu@@ ay@@ ac@@ il of July 2002
We share so many perspectives and I look forward now to hearing you and invite you please to address the European Parliament
It comprises three hundred and seven@@ ty-@@ four million Europeans who have decided to join hands to build together a far more integrated world , which goes beyond business and trade
I come here today as the constitutional President of Peru , having visited you in Strasbourg last time as a President-@@ elect
Nevertheless , Mr President , my belief in being a rebel for the cause of democracy and freedom , human rights and the environment has not changed
Europe plays a vital role in the world and I wish today to speak frankly to you
There is no room for selective globalisation in the world; globalisation cannot be confined solely to investment , trade or finance
We certainly need to achieve economic and financial integration
Latin America certainly , now more than ever , needs to diversify its financial and trade relations
The time has come , however , to pursue integration without losing our national identity
The time has come to accept globalisation and competitiveness on the basis that our diversity is our strength
Globalisation is not intended to create a uniform culture all over the world - it would be terrible if Ken@@ t@@ uc@@ ky F@@ ried Chic@@ ken or Mc@@ Don@@ al@@ ds were part of world culture
If you do not have a social conscience , I would ask you to think in terms of trade
Look at the waste of a labour force that could be part of the production process to enable the economy to grow in a sustainable manner
Look at the waste of a potential market comprising these 44 % of Latin Americans , who could consume more bread , more milk , more shir@@ ts and more shoes
If you do not want to consider the matter in terms of social fairness , look at it in terms of a business opportunity
I have come here today to share with you a concern that is latent in the heart of Latin America
I have raised this matter at the Gu@@ ay@@ a@@ quil Conference of Presidents and at the General Assembly of the United Nations
the challenge of harmonising the responsible handling of economic policies
Ladies and gentlemen of Parliament , Latin America is sil@@ ently becoming disillusion@@ ed with democracy
We now find ourselves with a dilemma which North Americans would define by saying we need to reconcile Wall Street with M@@ ain Street
We cannot close our eyes and ears to the po@@ ts and p@@ ans that demonstrators are p@@ ounding in Argentina , Venezuela , Ecuador , Colombia and Uruguay
We cannot turn a blind eye to this situation
People are starting to wonder why there is so little work and so much poverty when they have all this democracy
I know that I am deliberately simplifying the argument , to show that there is a great dilemma when it comes to reconciling the responsible handling of economic policies
Thirty years of unsuccessful change must not lead us to act irresponsibly
We must not advocate a return to populism
I am telling you this as a fervent supporter of freedom , democracy , human rights and the environment
I cannot , however , turn a blind eye to what I am seeing and hearing
In Peru , 54 % of men and women are condemned to living below the poverty level , and 23 % are condemned to living below the extreme poverty level
We believe in democracy
Furthermore , some are now saying that under Fujimori 's dictatorship they were better off
Something is happening in the region
I know that you are involved in meeting the great challenge of integrating Europe and perhaps I am dis@@ tracting you by sharing my concern
If I am , however , I make no apologies
I hope that the process of European integration , which I admire , will not lead you to ignore what is happening in a continent which has great potential
Democracy costs money - it is like a plant that needs to be watered after planting and we cannot take it for granted
Our hearts ble@@ ed when we see a sister nation such as Argentina
Democracies cannot be overthrown by traditional military cou@@ ps , but democracy can be weakened by a lack of tangible results for the poor
I am in favour of this
We cannot allow ourselves to fall into populism , because the consequence is hy@@ per@@ inflation and hy@@ per@@ inflation makes the poor even poorer
What , however , is good about not having inflation ?
Why should we faithfully comply with the recipe of the International Monetary Fund ?
Ladies and gentlemen of Parliament , two weeks ago in my country there was a regional and municipal election and my party did not achieve good results
I have decided to take State decisions with future generations in mind , and that is why I have paid a very high price
Man@@ aging the economy irresponsibly would have meant bread today and hunger tomorrow
I was born in a small town 4@@ 000 metres above sea level , in the Peruvian An@@ des , up in the clouds
I know that many might find my presence here strange
Some European parliamentarians have worked with me in the fight against dictatorship and corruption
From now on , I undertake to do all I can to ensure that men and women like me might be Presidents of Peru
This comment concerns a State policy decision
I have come to ask you , my European friends , not to sell us weapons
Please , I beg you , do not sell us planes , boats or tanks
Let us change the priorities of our precarious public budget
When I took on the Presidency last year , I promised my people not to disappoint them
This year , 2002 , I have decided to reduce military spending by 20 % to redirect it to health and education for the poor in Peru
I am going to do so for the next five years
Do not give us milk
Do not give us your agricultural products , please ?
because your giving us milk and wheat represents unfair competition for Peruvian farmers
With the affection and admiration I have for this House , allow me to tell you quite frankly that the time has come to build a two-@@ lane highway for trade
open up your markets
You tell us we should operate an open economy
You tell us we should not subsidise our agriculture , and I agree
Do not , then , however , subsidise your agriculture
Open up your markets
If we cannot market our products we will have more unemployed men and women
I like equality
I know you are doing this out of kindness
They do not want to be offered cr@@ umbs
All they ask is that you open up your markets on which we can sell our products , competing on quality and price
Ladies and gentlemen , it has fallen to me to govern a country following ten years of cruel dictatorship , associated with corruption and trafficking in drugs and arms
We were handed a country with justifiably high social expectations
We were handed a country that had been in recession for four years
We were handed a de-@@ institutionalised country
We were handed a country that has lost faith in its politicians
This can only be imagined in the most surreal political situation
This event struck the very core of the men and women of Peru , who cannot believe it
We have the responsibility to restore faith and confidence
Three days after taking over the Presidency , groups were already demonstrating outside the Houses of Parliament giving vent to their expectations
I now face the challenge of making these macroeconomic achievements felt in people 's pockets
This means , quite simply , investing in health , education and justice for the poor
Investment in health and education , as you know even better than I , is an investment with a high rate of return
The business of knowledge is low-@@ risk , long-term and extremely mobile
Pop@@ ul@@ ist governments may take power but they will not be able to nationalise our people 's knowledge
Governments in favour of excessive privatisation may take power but they will not be able to privatise what has been invested in people 's minds
Today I would like to share with you the thought that world economic health depends on the strength of the democratic institutions and global security
The Atlantic has become less of an obstacle
Globalisation and competitiveness , using technology , must have a human face and be more inclusive
We must achieve this by investing in health and education
We have come to learn from the experience of the European integration process
Latin America is trying to achieve its own integration
The Andean countries are trying to learn from the process you are undergoing
I would like to thank the President
He said in his speech that he wondered whether what he said was a distr@@ action
Far from it , it was a call to action
We thank you for your message , Mr President
I declare the formal sitting closed
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 4 December 2002
Mr President , I understand it is not possible to request a change , but may one protest against a change made by the Conference of Presidents ?
Today we should have been debating the Napolitano report on the role of regional and local authorities in European integration
It is a vitally important issue , and Parliament should have been ready to give its opinion on this to the Convention before the end of this year
For example , this week the Fisheries Council is debating cod stocks and the common fisheries policy
Scotland , which is hugely interested in that , at the moment has a wal@@ k-@@ on role
It is outrageous that this has been taken off the agenda
The proposal from the Conference of Presidents is that it will be discussed in Parliament in January
which will be made by Mrs Diamantopoulou on the future of pension systems , the Commission wishes to make a second communication by Mrs Schreyer on the modernisation of accounting
It seems to me that since both of these issues are of some interest and substance we run the possibility of running over on the time originally allocated
Perhaps whoever is in the Chair should have the discretion to add some extra time to allow colleagues to ask questions on these two important communications
Will question time be extended by a compensatory period please ?
The plan , Mr MacCormick , is not to have them in competition with each other but to extend , if necessary , the appropriate sitting time
Tomorrow at noon we will award the Sakharov Prize
in room W@@ IC 100 , we will celebrate the fif@@ teenth anniversary of the Sakharov Prize in the presence of many of the previous winners
, there will be a special exhibition on the fifteen years of the Prize which will take place in the area outside room W@@ IC 100
Mr President , have you received any news from the Turkish Government regarding Le@@ ila Zana ?
I have raised this matter at the Conference of Presidents on every occasion on which I have met with the Turkish authorities
I have no more information than you have in respect of your correspondence
However , when I speak tomorrow afternoon I will return to that matter on the assumption that our wishes will not , at that stage , have been fulfilled
Mr President , that is something I wish to oppose
We therefore oppose the Socialist Group 's motion
Mr President , I wanted to put another question relating to Wednesday
Why , yet again , has the time allotted to questions to the Council been reduced by half an hour ?
I want , at the same time , to register a protest against this
As you know , I regard the putting of questions as a fundamental parliamentary right
I regret the fact that this is happening more and more often
The answer , Mr Posselt , is that we have set for the Council a very ambitious agenda
They will be here until 7 p
We have already allocated this time to other issues , including the one on which we have just voted
The order of business was thus established
A major and historic decision was taken at the Copenhagen Summit
A number of issues of specific institutional interest to Parliament arose
These matters can be further explored by the groups in the debate with the Danish Presidency
Work is already in hand regarding this matter
A number of suggestions were put forward by committees and groups , but we must close this process by the end of January
Secondly , we have an indication that there has been considerable progress - for which I thank colleagues - on drawing up an interinstitutional agreement on better regulation and law-making
We have a commitment in principle across the institutions to try to bring closure to this matter before the spring summit meeting in Brussels
We have several months to work through the remaining issues before the deadline
I put the groups and various committees involved in this matter on notice in respect of that
Thirdly , a conclusion was reached that the European Convention should draw up its own final report in time for the European Council meeting at Thessaloniki
I also pointed out that we would treat such proposals with appropriate urgency when the matter is presented to us
Finally , on human rights issues , I placed considerable emphasis on the dialogue with Russia on the question of human rights in Chechnya
Mr President , the decision of the recent Copenhagen European Council is a victory for freedom and democracy in the face of the two totalitarian regimes which des@@ ol@@ ated Europe
This is an historical step which should not make us forget those people who are still deprived , as O@@ sw@@ al@@ do Pay@@ á puts it , of the right to rights
I believe everyone in the House shares your appreciation and joy that Mr P@@ aya Sar@@ di@@ ñ@@ as has finally been given a visa so that he can attend tomorrow 's ceremony
These decisions are extremely serious because they undermine more than 20 years of work by campaigners of linguistic causes such as Bre@@ ton and Al@@ sa@@ tian
I reiterate that , here in Als@@ ace for example , there are bil@@ ingual schools which are called community schools
The first was Turkish accession to the EU , and the second was the issue of referendums
What advice did Parliament 's President give the member of his own party in Denmark ?
You do not need to resort to lip reading
Just read the record
We will provide you with a copy of my speech
Mr President , it now transpires that the disaster involving the African Titanic off the Senegalese coast has probably claimed the lives of 2 000 victims
Last Saturday , relatives and sympath@@ isers held demonstrations in Dakar and Paris for the recovery of the ship and the victims
' We demand immediate recovery
This exceptional case calls for exceptional leadership and exceptional action , going outside the normal channels
This is such an exceptional case
You know , Mr President , that I have already mentioned this and I have not heard anything from the Commission over the past four weeks
I call on you as President to convey this message to President W@@ ad@@ en on our behalf
I will be happy to do it a second time
As you said , it is not the first time that I have been asked to do this
We have not had a specific response to the reply we gave on the last occasion
I will come back to you on this matter
Mr President , my comments relate to Côte d' Ivoire
You gave permission to send a parliamentary mission on 9 December on the basis of a resolution adopted on 10 October
This is a question of honour and dignity for this House
As you know , Mr S@@ car@@ bon@@ chi , the decision in principle to attend has been taken
One of the key issues on the minds of group leaders has been the security of those who may go
This is a serious responsibility
We can discuss the matter again and review the current security situation at our Conference of Presidents meeting this week
The principles on this matter are clear but the need to protect Members ' security is also paramount
The only crime they have committed is to endorse a referendum on democracy
That shows just how provocative a prize this is , and how important it is
I thought you might want to be aware of this before the discussion and prize-@@ giving ceremony tomorrow
We have just heard that Mr Mo@@ k@@ h@@ tar Y@@ a@@ hi@@ a@@ ou@@ i , one of Tunisia 's most well-known civil liberties campaigners , was abducted this morning in Tunis
He had already been assaulted on 11 December when he was violently attacked whilst on his way to visit his lawyer
My office will contact you for further details in order to follow up on that matter
In Britain the 30@@ th anniversary is regarded as the pe@@ ar@@ l anniversary
Some might regard Britain as the g@@ rit in the oyster that has created the pe@@ ar@@ l
What is being done on 1 January to mark the 30@@ th anniversary of the accession of these three great countries ?
I have no idea what you and your colleagues are planning , Mr Perry
I plan to be with my family
By a unilateral decision of the Belgian State Railways , this train has been withdrawn
It is not clear why this should happen , at precisely the moment when Europe is trying to promote rail travel over road travel
This is therefore a decision which is to be disputed on two different grounds
As far as Italy is concerned , we are doing our part
Senator Gi@@ am@@ pa@@ olo B@@ et@@ ta@@ mi@@ o , whom many of you will remember as a valuable member of the Parliamentary Bureau , has submitted a question to the Minister for Transport and Infra@@ structure
I urge you , Mr President , to make vigorous representations to the Belgian Government , calling for a reversal of this decision
Mr President , I am speaking to propose that this Parliament express its condemnation and rejection of the far@@ c@@ ical presidential elections which took place in Equatorial Guinea
We cannot continue to send agricultural surpluses which are constantly destroying the fragile agricultural economies of these countries
We have carried out ' everything but arms '; this is laudable , but entirely insufficient
We therefore need a specific , in-depth debate , which will lead to forward-@@ thinking decisions in accordance with our current needs
F@@ il@@ m foot@@ age that appears to be that compiled by the local police has got into the hands of the local British National Party who are distributing it
I hope you will raise the matter with the British authorities
As I hope you have already done as well , Mr Ford
Mr President , three or four days ago , the Italian police handed over an Iraqi family to the liberal democrat government of Syria
The head of the family had been condemned to death 20 years ago for belonging to the organisation known as Muslim Bro@@ thers
We fear that the sentence might already have been carried out in Syria
I call upon the European Parliament and its President to ask for more detailed information from the Italian Government
Extre@@ mely serious and somewhat mysterious uprisings and revol@@ ts have occurred in East Timor , which warrant the attention of the European authorities
The other day , he even said he would have no hesitation in using nuclear weapons
Those who appear to be fighting Islam and the Islamic revolu@@ tions are in fact funding them
Nor should we be surprised if the words of Bush senior come true
He said that , if it is in the interests of the United States , they will support and create terrorist organisations
This complexity can certainly be explained and justified
There is , therefore , a justifiable complexity and we shall never have a wholly simple system
That said , there is also a completely unjustifiable complexity in this matter
We are experiencing legislative chaos , procedural chaos and linguistic chaos
Legislative chaos when we see that decisions which are by nature fundamentally different are adopted for example in the same framework , namely the constitutional framework
There are provisions relating to policies and others relating to the institutions
We also have a decision of a budgetary nature - on resources - taken in a virtually constitutional framework
Lastly , we are certainly experiencing linguistic chaos , since every effort is made to avoid giving a name to what we are doing
We adopt laws , but we take care not to describe them as laws
We use the term decision , in other words something which comes from the depths of the hierarchy , to describe both individual measures and measures of a constitutional nature
No one understands anything
They would also be less legally certain without the backing of the Court of Justice for their adoption
Why must something which directly concerns fundamental rights not benefit from the guarantees and procedures applied to legislative acts established elsewhere ?
The question in terms of this bloc is whether to develop the ratification procedures
A legislative bloc is simple
Let us call all of these laws , however , because they are laws
There are , of course , specific applications , particularly in financial matters , but this is the path we must take
The third and last element is the implementing bloc , in other words the implementing regulations
In this respect , we must apply three simple principles
The powers that are currently best@@ owed upon the Council , particularly under Article 202 , must therefore be exercised by both arms of the legislative authority
Moreover , we must admit that we cannot regulate with 25 Member States in the same way as we have up to now
These , therefore , are the main points
It is a difficult subject
As Mr Amato said , there is nothing quite as complex as simplification
There are obviously sub@@ categories - we cannot simplify too much , unfortunately - but nonetheless there are these three main groupings
That seems sensible and would make our acts much more comprehensible to the public
I come to a point which is of particular importance , and which Mr Bourlanges touched on towards the end of his comments
It is this category of implementing act where we delegate the right to adopt certain types of act to the Commission
It is not that we want to im@@ mer@@ se ourselves in all the technical details of implementing measures
This is a simple system , one that would enable us to delegate far more than we do now , but it will also ensure democracy and transparency
I commend it to the House
Mr President , Mr Bourlanges should be congratulated on having drafted a good report on an extraordinarily complex set of questions
It is a report which will be of great interest to the Convention , which is itself studying these questions
My main amendment on behalf of my group seeks to insist upon a separate amendment procedure for the second part of the Constitutional Treaty
It is essential that the policy chapters are susceptible to a sof@@ ter form of revision than the existing unanimity , plus national ratification in all Member States
If we fail to bring in such a sof@@ ter procedure , it may never be possible to alter the political chapters
If the Union insists on the same procedure for the first and second parts , what is the point of splitting the Treaty in the first place ?
As regards this report , there are just three critical observations that I want to make
They will be less inclined to forgive us if we put before them what are manifestly tax@@ -raising powers for the European Union without actually calling them that
In paragraph 6 , the own resources decision is described as being an organic law
That proposals to fundamentally change the European Union 's con@@ federal nature should be put forward under this heading and in this report , is something I regard as highly dubious
Instead , a qualified majority of Member States is to be sufficient
I want to make it abundantly clear that German constitutional law would prevent consent being given to such a treaty
I would sincerely like to thank him for this , not least in that his proposals contain a number of points which my group considers to be important and positive
I cannot say the same for all his proposals , however , so I will focus on those which we feel to be most problematic
I would mention , in particular , the proposals Mr Bourlanges makes regarding the constitutional revision procedure , which we as a group cannot endorse
However , we feel that we cannot support the proposals he makes regarding the constitutional revision procedure because they are contradictory
Clearly , we or , at least , the majority of the group , are firmly in favour of the former
Another position which I feel it is important to stress concerns the legislative bloc
Our experience in this area has almost always been negative
We feel that this is too long and that it would extend the implementing procedure unnecessarily
In any case , it has proved difficult to apply effectively
This is a question which we need to highlight and explore further , and I hope that this will not be Parliament 's final word on the matter
Mr President , the Bourlanges report is both outstanding and technical , two qualities which are , more often than not , virtually impossible to combine in a single document
This is the first achievement on which the rapporteur is to be congratulated
Ultimately , this report is based entirely on an implicit presup@@ position , namely the vision of a py@@ ram@@ id structure for Europe where the nations make up the py@@ ram@@ id 's base
The top of the py@@ ram@@ id consists of a European Constitution , the report on which , shre@@ w@@ dly , does not say in so many words that nations would be subordinate
This development favoured by the report points to a crucial problem
What happens when a decision adopted by majority at European level contradicts a national constitution or a fundamental principle to which a nation is particularly attached ?
We find this model of Europe unacceptable; and furthermore , in an enlarged and ever more diverse Europe , it would simply not be able to operate
More broadly speaking , the report uses simplification as a pretext for making proposals in favour of supranational unification
the super-State is more simple
it weakens democracy considerably
Admittedly , paragraph 1 of the Bourlanges report affirms that its proposals are based on a principle of ' democratisation '
On reading the description provided however , one realises that this is what , in his speeches and in his draft constitution , President Prodi calls supranational democracy
Unfortunately , however , Mr President , this supranational democracy seems highly artificial , as the nations currently grant principle legitimacy to their national democracy
It is therefore nothing more than a trick which makes it possible to take the power away from the nations in order to harness more of it
We will bring Europe closer quite simply by giving national parliaments the right to intervene directly in the European decision-making process
The rest is mere detail
Mr President , I must begin by apologising for being delayed , thank to the vicissitudes of the European travel system
However , it reflects a very different tradition of political thinking from that in my own country
I believe this is the wrong way around
It was fascinating to hear the opposition a moment ago
I have to say that , over three and a half years , we have , in this Parliament , discussed a whole raft of proposals
Today , we are discussing the Bourlanges report that officially addresses the hierarchy of acts
Originally , this report was rather complex and quite theoretical , too theoretical , in fact
a constitutional bloc with principles , a legislative bloc and an implementing bloc for implementing measures
I should like to say one thing
Although we are giving our unqualified support to Mr Bourlanges , we do not see eye to eye with him on one particular point
We do not want a few states to be deprived of their veto right , as it were , when we come to revise the Treaty
In this respect , I endorse the views of Mrs Kaufmann and Mrs Frassoni
We will therefore be voting against this particular point
We remain adamant that the Treaty should be unanimous and should be changed unanimously
This does , however , pertain to the constitutional bloc@@ ; as far as the other blocs are concerned , we naturally endorse the view that these should be simplified
This , however , does not apply to the constitutional part , as we would then end up with things being done on a very unequal basis
I think this makes it right and proper to propose that a hierarchy of acts be used to create reliable forms of cooperation
I think that really is of the utmost interest for democratic and transparent lawmaking
Mr President , I shall say ' Well done ' to Mr Bourlanges
Well done , for I believe that , through your work , you have highlighted what will become one of the important subjects of the Convention
Well done too for succeeding in incorporating the question of terminology in your report
I believe that when Europeans try to explain to Europeans what the European Parliament does , it is best to use simple words
I imagine that the Convention will support this plan and this will be a step forward
You call for Article 202 to be reformed
defining mandates and scrutinising their execution
With regard to powers , it is important for the powers of the Council and those of the European Parliament to be parallel
If the Council gives up some of its powers , we could give some up as well , and vice versa
In addition , you also mentioned the question of coordination policies
Mr President , I am in favour , intellectually , of the process of streamlining and simplifying , so well argued by Jean-@@ Louis Bourlanges
It is the differences between the large States on the major issues that have impeded the Union 's progress
It is not square kilometres , long@@ it@@ udes , la@@ titudes and per capita GDP that determine how important countries are to the common interest , the European interest
Perhaps Mr Bourlanges , with his intelligence , knowledge and un@@ sw@@ er@@ v@@ ingly pro-European attitude , should have explored this point further and fought harder to find a reasonable and consensual solution
I hope he will do this , at least by tomorrow
Mr President , I should like to say thank you to the rapporteur for his tireless enthusiasm for European development and for his splendid and very detailed report
I would nonetheless draw attention to two points about which I disagree
The first point concerns the procedure for revising the treaties
That is something we have in any case learned from this process
I must nonetheless declare myself to be in complete disagreement with the rapporteur 's proposal with regard to changing the ratification procedure itself
We ought quite simply to stick to the procedure we have at present
The rapporteur is trying to have a procedure of approval by the Council and the European Parliament introduced whenever the two sides of industry have arrived at a proposal
I believe that such a procedure would give rise to an irrelevant third party in the social dialogue
If this enlargement is not accompanied by a profound constitutional change , what we are probably celebrating is the death of the European Union
In other words , giving them options which allow them - as in the case of Schengen or the euro - not to contribute to the European project
This is perhaps the main weakness of Mr Bourlanges 's proposal
the constitution , the laws and the implementing provisions subordinate to the laws
In the EU , we have thirty different instruments
We are dealing , then , with a system that is utterly lacking in transparency and is also to some degree undemocratic
What makes the Bourlanges Report so creditable is that it represents a quantum leap in this area
This really is a great leap forward in terms of clarity and democratisation
As regards the constitutional level , it is my view that there will have to be a less cumbersome review procedure for the second part of the constitution
This is , of course , a highly sensitive issue , though , as majority decisions obviously mean that someone can end up losing
The third issue , that of separating normal lawmaking by Parliament and the Council from the implementing provisions enacted by the Commission , is of great significance
We need to be clear in our own minds here about what is legislative and what is executive
We could make things easier for ourselves if we in Parliament were not to enact technical regulations , but only the acts underlying them
Mr President , I am certainly not going to talk about the content , but I would nonetheless like to clarify two or three facts
we are in favour of codecision
I fully understand that there might be hostility on principle , and I understand what Mr van den Berg said on the subject
I would not , however , want any unfounded accusations to be made
It is untrue to say that the proposal is in any way insulting or dis@@ d@@ ain@@ ful towards small States
The proposal would allow States that represent 2
4 % of the Community population to veto the adoption or ratification of a Treaty that might thus be supported by States representing 97
So let us not have any unfounded accusations
If one is in favour of Member State sovereignty , I can understand that one would not want a treaty to be ratified by just some of the States
My proposal , however , does not discriminate in any way against small or medium-sized States
I would like to say a word about Mr Duff , who tabled Amendment No 14
I agree with the content of this amendment , since it states that we need to revise parts A and B of the future Constitution differently
I made a proposal to this effect but I did not receive the support of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and I therefore cannot endorse this amendment personally
This report is indeed remarkable in many aspects
First of all , because it covers in depth one of the fundamental points of the issues raised at Laeken
This diplom@@ at , Mr T@@ alle@@ yr@@ and , who Mr Bourlanges knows well , used to claim , quite wrongly , that spirit may be very useful but does not lead anywhere
On the contrary , Mr Bourlanges , your spir@@ ited report leads to a very well-argued resolution
Mr President , I would like to emphasise three points
Naturally , adoption and revision procedures for future constitutional treaties are also important
The Commission , like Parliament , would like to call on the Convention as a model for these procedures more frequently from now on
Over and above procedural issues , Parliament and the Commission share the same point of view on the need to include sectoral policies within the constitutional treaty
Yet again , I must reiterate that we cannot have strong institutions with weak policies
My second point , ladies and gentlemen , which is fundamental to this report , concerns the creation of a genuine legislative bloc
The time has come to call a spade , a spade , as you say yourself , and therefore to talk about European laws
My third point concerns the role you would like the European Commission to play in implementing legislation
This applies to the fields of police and justice and to the field of common foreign and security policy
Mrs Randzio-Plath has emphasised this point , moreover
We need to carry out fundamental rationalisation to know who does what in the European Union and introduce greater transparency and accountability into the exercising of these implementing competences
It is in this regard , ladies and gentlemen , that I must inform you of two concerns the Commission has on two points in your report
The first was raised by Mrs Frassoni earlier
It relates to the possibility of awarding at least part of these implementing competences to an authority other than the Commission
Ladies and gentlemen , we must avoid encouraging or facilitating what could be perceived as dismantling regulatory power in the European Union
I am indeed talking about implementing measures
I shall not repeat the Commission 's position , as it is already well-known
We shall have to fight to impose the ambitious conclusions arising from the report
You can count on Mr Vitorino and myself for that
This is an element that Mrs Kaufmann and Mr Duff raised earlier , which makes Mr Bourlanges ' report all the more useful and relevant
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11
a Council decision concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System , in particular in the fight against terrorism ,
a Council regulation concerning the introduction of some new functions for the Schengen Information System , in particular in the fight against terrorism
In this context , two Spanish initiatives were submitted to us in the aim of giving the SIS new functions , primarily for combating terrorism
It is also important that Europol and Eurojust 's needs to access the SIS data are more rigorously examined and justified
The proposals for the full recording of sear@@ ches are to be welcomed , but it seems appropriate to specify in the Article what information must be recorded
This applies to the proposal to extend access to data on missing , stolen or lost identity documents
The Commission has commissioned a feasibility study to be undertaken on the development of S@@ IS@@ -@@ II , which should be available in March 2003
I hope that the European Parliament will then have the opportunity to deliver an opinion on these conclusions
The way in which this will be managed will be determined in a future document
It is to be hoped that S@@ IS@@ -@@ II will be developed by 2006
I should also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation and , particularly , the socialist shadow rapporteur , S@@ ér@@ gi@@ o S@@ ousa P@@ into
In fact , I can even add that some of the amendments proposed by the rapporteur are already included in the texts of the Council working group studying these initiatives
This access must not transform the SIS into a research tool and nor must it be in any way disproportionate to the reasons for such access being granted
This is , as a matter of fact , the type of information that Europol is already authorised to request and obtain directly from Member States
This will enable us better to help candidate countries prepare for the future elimination of internal borders , which can only take place when S@@ IS@@ -@@ II becomes operational
Mr President , Commissioner Vitorino , ladies and gentlemen , the Spanish initiative and Mr Coelho 's report represent the fulfilment of a longstanding parliamentary demand
It is also a real step forward that invitations to tender can be coll@@ ated
In his report , Mr Coelho addresses the issues and problems relating to data protection and puts forward well-@@ reasoned proposals for resolving them
His report therefore deserves wholehearted support
Mr Coelho himself has already pointed out that access will be able to be extended to certain persons or bodies only in conjunction with this new generation
The application of fifteen different sets of national data protection rules within Europol and Eurojust is even now leading to chaos
In addition , a lack of parliamentary and judicial oversight has resulted in a democratic deficit such as would make Mon@@ tes@@ quie@@ u turn in his grave
Let me just say something to the left-wingers in this House
I see that Mr Krarup is here
Mr Krarup , you are opposed to the Schengen Information System and would like to see it abolished
You will not get a majority in this House
For that , Commissioner , we wish you every success and perhaps a little more courage than you have hitherto demonstrated
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Coelho , I wish to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his work
The report makes a balanced evaluation of the two Spanish initiatives on giving new functions to the Schengen Information System , which is especially important in the fight against terrorism
Some of these measures have a direct effect on the Schengen Information System
We are therefore attempting to amend certain Articles of the Schengen Convention in the aim of giving it new functions
Giving Europol and the national members of Eurojust the opportunity to access certain data in the SIS is one of the most important practical proposals of this initiative
The European Police Service will therefore have the right to consult and study SIS data only for the purposes for which these data were provided
National members of Eurojust will have to record all sear@@ ches they undertake and will not be able to supply data to third countries or to other bodies
This applies primarily to the proposal seeking to give the bodies responsible for issuing and studying permits the opportunity to access the data contained in the SIS
For the reasons I have given , the report Carlos Coelho has presented deserves the applause and the support of the Socialist Group
There is of course a type of criminal beside whom the small f@@ ry we have outside the EU p@@ ale into in@@ significance
That was an aside
My main criticism and my attitude to the proposals before us are expressed in a minority opinion on the report
I merely need to cite an example in the form of Article 10@@ 1a of the proposal concerning Europol 's access to the Schengen Information System
A number of basic requirements are made of Europol , but there is no reasonable guarantee whatsoever that Europol will comply with those requirements
There is no reasonable likelihood of the bodies concerned being of a sufficiently trustworthy character
The rule of law will sustain irreparable damage
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11
Mr President , you have given me the floor as rapporteur but in fact the name on the report is that of Mrs Damião
I would like to begin by sincerely thanking her for the hard work that she has done on this dossier
I know I speak for everyone when I say I wish her the fullest and speedi@@ est possible recovery
This was too open-ended for the Employment Committee and , therefore , we wanted to pin down that definition of sporadic and low intensity still further
We think that is an important step in the right direction
Amendment No 2 makes provision for breaks for workers obliged to wear individual breathing equipment because of their potential exposure
Again , we think this is an important step
It is extremely uncomfortable to work for long periods in individual breathing equipment
I say I hope that will be the case because the deadline for amendments on this dossier closed only a few minutes ago
I hope that no groups have taken advantage of that deadline to table amendments
But it would delay the adoption of this dossier beyond the Danish Presidency into the spring - the earliest would be March under the Greek Presidency
That would simply lead to a further delay of weeks , if not months , before this directive could be agreed
So I hope no groups will take advantage of that deadline - if any have , I hope they will , even at this late stage , withdraw those amendments
Therefore , I would hope we could include this on the voting list tomorrow
Everyone has had the amendments agreed in committee for a couple of weeks now in translation
I want also to express my satisfaction at the unanimous conviction that the protection of workers against the risks of exposure to asbestos must be improved
The Commission attaches the greatest importance to all measures designed to protect the health and safety of workers
We have emphasised this interest in the social agenda and confirmed it in the Commission 's communication on a new Community strategy on health and safety at work
It is with great satisfaction that I can inform you that the Commission fully accepts the three amendments that Parliament has proposed in this second reading
The Commission is convinced that the three proposed amendments improve the text and contribute to a better application of the directive
Finally , I would like to thank Parliament , as well as the Danish Presidency and the Council , for their work to date on this issue
We should not forget that the effects of exposure to asbestos have dramatic repercussions for workers ' health and even for their families
With the quick adoption of this important directive , we will demonstrate that the health and safety of our workforce is at the top of our agenda
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I must firstly congratulate Mrs Damião
what percentage of risk has to be accepted ?
But it is also the case that certain risk agents are characterised by their almost imper@@ cep@@ tible , hidden and silent , and therefore more dangerous , action
Ex@@ posure to asbestos can cause serious illnesses , such as ple@@ ural and lung fib@@ ros@@ is and cancer of the lung , ple@@ ura or per@@ it@@ one@@ um
Per@@ i@@ ods of incubation vary , according to the academics , from 20 to 50 years
In cases of demo@@ lition , workers can and must come into contact with asbestos despite the fact that this is prohibited globally
While it is mainly used in activities connected to construction , its use is not exclusive to that economic activity
In fact , it has been used in marine , aeronautical and industrial equipment construction and these can therefore be considered to be risk activities
I support the rapporteur 's three amendments
Re@@ qu@@ esting practical orientation on the basis of social dialogue to prevent the consequences of sporadic or low intensity exposure
C@@ alling for the provision of suitable breaks in situations of physical or climatic burden , which should also be established on the basis of social agreement
The three requests express a will to comply with the Lisbon strategy
That strategy spoke of better jobs and better jobs undoubtedly means safer jobs
I am therefore particularly pleased to hear that the Commissioner is in favour of these amendments
Mr President , in order to be effective , all of this legislation , this modification , this updating of the legislation , requires other measures
As indicated by the health at work strategy 2002-2006 , it is necessary to promote a culture of prevention
That prevention is the objective of the amendments I am referring to
We will therefore be complying with the provisions of Article 31 of the European Union 's Charter of Fundamental Rights
Mr President , I too would like to wish Mrs Damião a full and speedy recovery and thank her for her work on this report
I would also like to thank Mr Hughes for his efforts
In the absence of Mrs Damião , he has done excellent work in reaching the compromises which we have before us here in this debate
As@@ best@@ os is a silent , invisible killer
Some 30 000 people per year in western Europe , North America , Japan and Australia die from asbestos exposure
While exposure levels pe@@ aked in the 1970s , it takes years for many asbest@@ o@@ s-related can@@ cers to emerge
Medical practitioners in this area consequently predict that there will be a steady rise in the frequency of asbest@@ o@@ s-@@ linked can@@ cers until the year 2020
I welcome the amendments that have been agreed
They do not add any serious or onerous burden either on the employers of the workers involved or on governments
However , I urge that sanctions be introduced to ensure that , on its adoption , this directive will be implemented effectively
Mr President , I wish to thank Mrs Damião for all her work and I hope that she will get well soon
Every year 4 500 people die from asbest@@ o@@ s-related diseases in the UK alone
It is predicted that 250 000 will die in the European Union of these diseases in the next 35 years
Medical and scientific evidence demonstrates that there is a real need for this directive
I am delighted that the production and marketing of asbestos will be banned across the EU from 2005
Thankfully , it has already been banned in the UK
However , there are still millions of tonnes of asbestos in Europe 's buildings throughout the European Union
I welcome the fact that this directive will lower the exposure limit values for asbestos
I emphatically support the three amendments Mr Hughes has talked about
Had it saved just one asbestos worker 's life , it would have been worth it
Nevertheless , I decided against retabling the amendments because I did not have the support of the Committee on Employment or the other groups in this House
For that reason , I will advise my group to vote for this directive , because it is greatly needed
On 10 April , at first reading , I insisted that more should be done about asbestos than the Commission had proposed
Among those who are at risk are family members of asbestos workers , residents of d@@ well@@ ings that contain asbestos and people who are in the vicinity of asbestos removal activities
Initially , I received wide support for this until the Commission pointed out the legal pitfalls
The Commission is against this extension , and the Council feels even more strongly about it
The compromise that has been thr@@ ashed out and the three corresponding amendments are therefore , in my view , inadequate
I think that we are talking in terms of adding the all-important , finishing touches to a directive that mainly deals with the position of employees
These are my comments on Directive 8@@ 3/@@ 4@@ 7@@ 7/@@ EC
I conclude from this that we , given the incubation time of 25 years or longer , must apply the precautionary principle more forcefully
I would refer to a few areas we have done absolutely nothing about , such as electro@@ magnetic waves , op@@ tical radiation , O@@ PS , softeners and their use
Not only should we tackle these products , we should also consider the use to which they are put in production processes
This automatically leads to the need for legislation and directives in those countries , but also sanctions , hence also an amendment
In addition , the partners should be involved; this all seems to make perfect sense to me
Who , though , maintains law and order in practice ?
This is why we need to focus on this in our forthcoming Health and Safety programme
Finally , I should like to see a register drawn up of those buildings , and in that sense , I would endorse Mr Meijer
This is , in fact , what we had asked for , but the Council , because of difficulties , did not immediately accept it
the Commission building , but that has been razed to the ground
We are used to meeting close to midnight , so it is splendid to be here today and see everyone awa@@ ke
We all know that asbestos is one of the greatest threats to workers ' health in the EU
It is estimated that , over the next 35 years , up to 500 000 deaths will be directly related to the serious illnesses caused by asbestos
I think that experience with asbestos and the debate in Parliament and elsewhere show very clearly how incredibly important it is that we take the precautionary principle very seriously
For many years , this principle was not taken seriously , and we can see the consequences today
I am therefore also pleased that all the groups in Parliament have chosen to support this directive
Overall , the present proposal provides workers with better protection , and I am pleased that many of Parliament 's proposals have been approved by the Council
There are many things we could have done better but , if we conclude the procedure now , it could save a number of workers from these very serious illnesses
I therefore hope that the Council will approve the amendments and that we can obtain a directive as quickly as possible
Mr President , ' better late than never ' is what could be said about the series of recommendations seeking to ban asbestos in the European Union
That , however , would mean forgetting the generations of workers who have died as a result of working with asbestos , even though its harmful nature was already known
It would mean forgetting the thousands of others who will die from it even once it has been banned , in a few months or years
It is this serv@@ ility that has delayed a measure as basic as banning asbestos for so long
Mr President , like my colleague , Mrs Thorning-Schmidt , I was looking forward to a midnight speaking slot , as this is a health and safety issue
It is quite symbolic that we are speaking about this matter at a reasonable time because it goes so much further than just health and safety
This morning in the United Kingdom , in our flagship news programme , the Today Programme , unusually the question of asbestos was raised at another reasonable hour
It was raised because of the matter that Mrs Thorning-Schmidt raised , namely the implementation of this directive
It is import@@ ant@@ ; it has huge agreement , but we must also understand the real dangers
Environmental protection and protection for public health are clearly not the European Union 's priorities , despite what it may say
Its priority is to pursue maximum profits for big business
The debate is closed
If my information is correct , the vote on this report will take place on Wednesday , from 11
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Breyer , for her report which responds to the question put forward by the Commission
The question was which foods should be allowed to be ir@@ radi@@ ated in the European Union ?
The Commission put this question to Parliament and the Council following a consultation of industry and consumer organisations and other interested parties
The consultation received a polarised response
Sta@@ ke@@ holders were either totally against this technology or in favour of it
There would seem to be no common ground between these two camps
Currently , the European Union-wide positive list of products authorised for ir@@ radiation treatment contains only dried ar@@ omatic her@@ bs , sp@@ ices and vegetable seas@@ on@@ ings
For the completion of this list , the Commission presented three options for discussion
Such foods include dried fruits , cereals , chicken , offal , egg white and gu@@ m ar@@ ab@@ ic
The Commission will take note of Parliament 's conclusions but must await the reaction of the Council before making any formal proposal
However , I would like , on behalf of my colleague , Mr Byrne , to take this opportunity to clarify a few points
First , I would like clearly to reiterate that the Scientific Committee on Food has concluded that ir@@ radi@@ ated foods are safe
This opinion is based on many scientific studies and is shared by the World Health Organisation and scientific bodies
Therefore , additional toxic@@ ology studies are not required , as the views of the scientific community are very clear on this issue
There are many misconceptions about this technique
I would stress that not all foods can or will be ir@@ radi@@ ated
not all foods are cooked and not all foods are put in the refriger@@ ator
Ir@@ radiation is just one method of food preservation
For some foods it is better than other techniques , for others it is not
The European Union has very strict labelling rules for ir@@ radi@@ ated foods
Even if a compound food contains only small amounts of ir@@ radi@@ ated ingredients , this fact has to be clearly indicated
We also have the technical tools to enforce correct labelling
The Commission has financed the development and standardisation of methods for the detection of ir@@ radi@@ ated foods
These methods are used by the food control authorities to check foods on the market
The first report of the Commission on food ir@@ radiation , published recently , shows that the overwhelming majority of foods on the market are correctly labelled
This means that consumers can choose freely between ir@@ radi@@ ated and non-@@ ir@@ radi@@ ated products
I would also like to reiterate that current legislation already requests Member States to report the results of their checks on ir@@ radiation facilities and on food products
If products are detected by the food control authorities which do not comply with legal requirements , they have to be removed from the market
Finally , I note that the report stigma@@ tises third countries , in particular the United States and Brazil , for using this technique
I consider this to be inappropriate as our own Scientific Committee considers ir@@ radi@@ ated foods to be safe
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I will start by asking you to excuse my voice , which is affected by a cold
This report finds us again debating the extent to which food is ir@@ radi@@ ated in the Community and the ways in which this should be regulated
The end of the 1990s saw the adoption of a directive , after lengthy debate , which allows only dried ar@@ omatic her@@ bs and sp@@ ices to be ir@@ radi@@ ated in the EU
I think this makes it clear that the directive on ir@@ radiation deserves to be strongly criticised and its presup@@ positions refuted
My second point is that ir@@ radiation is principally about keeping foodstuffs fresh throughout long journeys
Pra@@ wns are a prime example of this , in that they are taken from northern Germany to Morocco to be pe@@ el@@ ed
Mr President , Commissioner , I have always believed that consumer and health protection should take precedence over all other considerations
Compliance with the precautionary principle , however , does not mean preventing any technological progress in the field of processing foods
Nonetheless , ion@@ isation must not , of course , be used to compensate for negligence with regard to hygiene
I found the draft report that Mrs Breyer presented to us in the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy last September particularly disappointing
It is essential that we avoid the confusion caused by some Members
What we are discussing here is the content of the report by Mrs Breyer and not the Commission communication
I would , however , like to tell Mrs Breyer that I have not been subject to any pressure
This report , following the adoption of most of my amendments and those of Mr Bowis , was adopted unanimously by the Parliamentary committee
My group considered that a balance had been struck and that this report could be accepted as it was , even though some particularly crow@@ d-@@ pleasing paragraphs remained
Paragraph 14 , for example , adds nothing at all to the report
The Member for the Green Party considers that it should be obligatory for food manufacturers to prevent risks to workers , human health and the environment
How can we retain our credibility in the eyes of consumers if we restrict ourselves to this type of statement ?
We must concentrate on taking practical decisions that increase consumer safety effectively
It was to this end that I tabled the amendments adopted in committee seeking to increase controls to prevent il@@ legally-@@ ion@@ ised products from being placed on the market
Furthermore , I do not share the rapporteur 's views on the transport of goods
I believe it is beneficial today to be able to import and export products that could not have been transported in the past
S@@ pices , for example , can be transported over extremely long distances
I do not see how preserving foods for longer compromises the objective of sustainable development that we all want to achieve
Lastly , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to take this opportunity to make a general comment
I believe it is thoroughly regrettable that Parliament is prepared to speak and draft reports on every and any communication from the European Commission
This kind of procedure was useful when we were only being consulted
Today , however , it would be more effective and more logical if we concentrated on our legislative work
I shall not say any more on this matter , which , in my opinion , did not really need further amendments or another debate in plenary
Mr President , my group takes a rather different view from that of the last speaker
We believe that it is right for Parliament to be consulted
My group will also support the amendment , which other colleagues and I have signed in the name of the Socialist Group , for the deletion of paragraph 4
Not because we necessarily disagree with the Scientific Committee on the issue of whether radiation can be safe for foodstuffs , but because it is not the whole story
The question is , why is this being done ?
Is it really for the benefit of the consumer ?
Is it something for which there is a consumer demand ?
If that was the case , we would not have as many cases as there are , certainly in my country , of illegal and covert ir@@ radiation
This has been carried out because they do not want consumers to know about it
They particularly do not want people to know about and reflect upon the trade which is more concerned with cost-@@ cutting than with the end product in terms of consumer satisfaction
Mrs Breyer referred to shri@@ m@@ ps being taken from one market to another , pe@@ el@@ ed in one continent and brought back to another
it is all about the profits that go into this business
The onus of proof continues to be on those who wish to do these things
The proof has not yet been provided
Mr President , Commissioner , I am old enough to remember the vigorous debate on ir@@ radi@@ ated food that raged throughout Europe 15 to 20 years ago
It was very similar to the debate on GM foods we have today
It is a fact that unified scientific opinion , the WHO and the FAO say that ir@@ radiation in itself is not at all hazardous
It is therefore safe to say that recitals I and J of this report are quite misleading
The technology is presumably good for those parts of the world in which food safety quite simply means having anything at all to eat
Having said that , I would , however , also insist that there is no reason whatsoever in modern Europe for ir@@ radi@@ ating anything other than , specifically , sp@@ ices
That is something there are good reasons for doing , because other methods of steril@@ ising sp@@ ices are still less appropriate from health and environmental points of view
I do not believe it is dangerous , but I think it is extremely inappropriate for ourselves
Mr President , just like the previous speaker , I believe there are no sustainable arguments for permitting the ir@@ radiation of food other than sp@@ ices
Instead , quite a few Member States should be exercising tighter control over the ir@@ radiation of food that ought not to be ir@@ radi@@ ated
We wish to tighten up the report by adopting Amendments Nos 2 and 3 and so making these constitute Parliament 's position
There is an obvious risk of ir@@ radiation 's being used to conceal poor hygiene or the fact that food is too old really to be put on the market
We have no reason to permit methods that make this possible
I believe that consumers are thereby in a way being tricked into buying things that are not of the same quality
It is also partly a question of what kind of agricultural and food policy we are to have
We recommend the latter alternative
It seems that fresh food and safe food do not always go hand in hand
Every year , many people die as a result of poisoning by Sal@@ mon@@ ella and C@@ amp@@ y@@ lob@@ ac@@ ter in chicken , for example
These bacteria can be controlled by chemicals , such as meth@@ yl bro@@ mi@@ de , which is toxic
A major disadvantage of using this method is that traces of these toxic substances can be found in food
Food ir@@ radiation forms a good alternative in order to kill micro@@ organisms and prevent subsequent food poisoning
If we want to eat fresh produce , then it is impossible first to treat it ther@@ m@@ ally
However , in order to prevent vegetables , fruit and cereal products from going off , we can ir@@ radi@@ ate them
This is therefore a great way of keeping produce fresh after all
Any harmful substances already produced by the micro@@ organisms cannot be eliminated by ir@@ radiation
Hy@@ gi@@ ene and sanitary regulations therefore need to continue to apply during production and agricultural processes
How , though , do we now know that this fresh produce is also safe ?
First of all , experience has taught us that food ir@@ radiation is common practice in countries both inside and outside the European Union
The ir@@ radiation of food does , however , result in new substances being formed , as is also the case when food is cooked
Only in the case of fats is it not entirely clear whether ir@@ radiation could have adverse health implications
This requires further investigation
The four conditions laid down in the 1999 framework directive are thus met
I would therefore like to make provision for adding , inter alia , vegetables , fruit and cereal products to the positive list
In the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , the resolution has been improved by the incorporation of amendments
I do , however , still have a comment on labelling
Labelling should not function as a warning sign
Once it has been proven that the product is safe , a warning is no longer relevant
This would wrongly give the consumer the idea that something was wrong with the produce after all
We should therefore not reject food ir@@ radiation out of hand but respect it for what it is
Five years ago , Mrs Blo@@ ch von Blo@@ t@@ tn@@ itz was the rapporteur for food ir@@ radiation
At the time , the Commission wanted to take swift action and ir@@ radi@@ ate far more foods than simply her@@ bs and sp@@ ices
At least now we are discussing it first , which is an improvement
Different arrangements exist in the fifteen countries
In my own country , the Netherlands , potatoes are ir@@ radi@@ ated but I have never seen this displayed on the label
European law is not applied properly in this area
Ir@@ radiation is not necessary
There are many alternatives
If labelling were honest , consumers would not buy the products
This is also the reason why there is fraudulent labelling
Cy@@ clo@@ but@@ ad@@ i@@ ene is a substance that is always detectable when food is ir@@ radi@@ ated
It is therefore perfectly possible to label properly , as the substance is always detectable
This is the A@@ ch@@ illes ' he@@ el of the ir@@ radiation industry , for consumers do not want it
If the substance were labelled explicitly , this industry would die a slow death
Mr President , I rather liked the introduction from the Commissioner on this
he was mis@@ reading paragraph 3
You need to look at all the changes that took place in committee
After all , food has been treated with ion@@ ising radiation for some 50 years , as the rapporteur rightly said
In my country , the UK , products include vegetables , fruit , cereals , poultry , fish , shellfish - not too many fro@@ gs ' legs
All that range , to a certain degree , is given this treatment
Different countries have different lists
The common ground between us is that it must not pose a health hazard , is of benefit to consumers and is labelled
If there is a need and if it is safe , then why not ?
That is the committee 's broad view
The WHO says so
The EU Scientific Committee on Food says so , and it therefore is an element of consumer protection in itself
There is a need , for instance , in hospitals , to protect the food of some very vulnerable patients from dangerous bacteria
It can protect food from contamination
What it cannot do is to reverse contamination or pu@@ tre@@ faction in food
I suspect the answer is somewhere around the first and second options , but we are not at this stage dealing with the legislative proposal
The Commission is in listening mode
We needed cool , calm reflection on this
We are looking for something a little more measured
The report in its original form was more like the description of the Mer@@ o@@ vin@@ gi@@ an d@@ y@@ nasty as des@@ potism tempered by assassination
The reality is that we have a process that is safe if used properly
It can bring benefits and it should be considered carefully with proper risk assessment and risk management , but without scaremongering
The amendments that Mrs Grossetête and I proposed and the committee supported bring this report back to where the Commission might prefer it to be
I am also grateful to the Commissioner for the clarity of what he has had to say about this problem area
Things cannot , I believe , be left as they stand , and the situation is unacceptable
The Commission , in its communication , notes that both the FAO and the WHO regard it as scientifically proven that ir@@ radiation is quite safe for consumers
The WHO , indeed , urges that it be used more , as the procedure reduces risks to the consumer
It states that there have been no occasions on which the critical dose has been exceeded in the European Union
The detection methods are in place
We can determine whether products have been treated , be it legally or illegally
Why , then , do we constantly have to go over this discussion again and again ?
We see , then , that all the conditions have been met for a positive list to be drawn up and for the Commission to deal with it
The Commission , though , is getting cold feet
And so we go back to our discussions and to bemo@@ aning this dreadful state of affairs
It is then that the hygiene argument is produced
I helped draw up the directive on hygiene conditions in the handling of fresh meat
I would be the last person to want to cut anything out here , but we discussed HACCP when we worked on the current version of the food hygiene directive
That is what this procedure is there for
The only acceptable approach is for the Commission to draw up the positive list very quickly , and , moreover , not in the form it has now proposed
The real need is for change in the situation in the European Union
We cannot afford to keep on being weighed down by this ideological ball@@ ast
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11
Mr President , it was not automatic that this House should decide to debate the Socrates and ' Youth for Europe ' Community action programmes here today
Moreover , the disproportionately high cost of administration and the cumbersome administrative procedures bear no relation to their usefulness
That the Commission has delayed presentation of its evaluation report is truly beyond comprehension
It is this that caused the consequent delay in the subsequent report from the Court of Auditors
Despite this , my report on the Special Report and on the Socrates and ' Youth for Europe ' programmes has something very positive to say
I have no doubt that these programmes are important for transnational cooperation in the united Europe , and indeed necessary for it , and that they supplement the education system
This amount doubled in the following programme for the years from 2000 to 2006
The national offices must be equipped with adequate human , material and financial resources in order to effectively perform the tasks entrusted to them
For we are , after all , agreed that good education is the basis for future economic success and for Europe 's ability to compete in the world
These decisions also specify in their annexes the tasks to be carried out by the agencies
Furthermore , the clauses of the contracts between the Commission and the national agencies have been clarified and simplified
The Commission , within the scope of contractual relations with the national agencies , carries out controls and audits of both their operation and projects funded
The agencies ' financial accounts are certified by approved bodies before being submitted to the Commission
Progress has also been made in terms of the management of centralised actions
At her request , various documents at@@ testing to this progress were given to Mrs Langenhagen after she had drawn up her draft report
Mr President , speaking on behalf of the Socialist Group , I would like to warmly congratulate the rapporteur , above all on the highly critical comments she has made
EUR 500 million , Commissioner - and I would like to tell you what it means when money is paid out in this area so slowly as to become indefensible
It means that class war is being waged
Under those circumstances , the first to be prevented from taking part in programmes of great value to Europe are students from poorer backgrounds
And this invitation to consider the matter is particularly what I wanted to convey to the Commission
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11

lessons to be learned and proposals for the future
I am especially grateful to our chairman , Mrs Redondo , to the secretariat , which did excellent work , to the scientific service , and to the Commission
February 2001 saw what was no doubt the most serious outbreak of foot and mouth disease Europe had ever known
It affected Ireland , the Netherlands , France and , in particular , Great Britain
In Great Britain alone , where the epidemic indeed broke out , official estimates state that 6
5 million animals were killed in the course of combating it
Other sources mention up to 10 million
The Netherlands lost 2@@ 85 000 animals and France , where there were four outbreaks , 65 000 of them
The consequences were catastrophic for everyone concerned
This also means that we have no judicial function , nor are we able to resolve scientific disputes
In our report , we cannot pass judgments , let alone condemn anyone in advance for things we cannot prove anyway
This was not within our remit and we were not equipped for that purpose
That this has been cut to six months since May this year represents a massive step forward
We advocate three months
I want now to list some of our most important demands
Greater attention must be given to bio-@@ safety
For it was a farmer 's irresponsible working practices that caused the epidemic to break out in Great Britain
There must be further improvements to the animals ' traceability and therefore also to the way they are identified
It is also important to do everything possible to prevent illegal imports of animal products from countries where foot and mouth disease is endemic
The Commission has already decided that , for example , travellers from these countries may no longer bring products of this sort into the EU
This , then , is an area in which there is an urgent need for people to be informed
There is , though , one thing that I want to make clear
Infec@@ ted stocks will always be slaughtered , as will any animals put at risk by contact with them
Do not , then , raise people 's hopes too high
I might mention that , in Germany until 1990 , only cattle were in@@ oc@@ ulated , to the exclusion of all other animals
Let me just say something about the voting
V@@ ote for my amendments and for those tabled by the Socialist Group
Being a politician myself , I can quite understand that they were made in an excess of political enthusiasm , but please do your in@@ fighting at home
For that purpose , the European Parliament is the least suitable of all platforms
there are fourteen Member States in the European Union besides Great Britain
The combating of epidemics calls for a worldwide strategy , as foot and mouth disease is an international disease and not a British one
What is , unfortunately , certain is that there will certainly be another outbreak of foot and mouth disease
The question is only that of where and when it will occur and with what intensity
My services and I followed your work very closely
We have attended all your meetings , hearings , missions and discussions and have given evidence and support whenever required
I am confident that you will find that the views of Parliament are strongly reflected in the Commission 's policy response to foot and mouth disease
I will now turn to the key conclusions and recommendations in your report
I wish to make a very clear distinction between illegal introduction and legal imports
Illegal actions are obviously , by their nature , very difficult to eliminate
The Commission has , however , made proposals within the framework of the hygiene package to withdraw exemptions from the strict animal health conditions and control procedures for imports
Our awareness campaign in relation to this measure will begin on 1 January 2003
As for control on legal imports , the evidence indicates that Community import conditions and controls at external borders have been effective
Prior to last year 's outbreak , the EU was broadly F@@ M@@ D@@ -free for almost a decade
During that time hundreds of thousands of tonnes of fres@@ h-@@ meat products were safely imported
These imports included large quantities from disease-@@ free regions in South America , where FMD is endemic and vaccination is practised
The outbreak last year could not have originated in South America as the O@@ 1 P@@ an-@@ Asia strain of the virus is unknown in that continent
Calls for a ban on such imports must be viewed in this light , yet such calls continue to be made
I find it difficult not to conclude that protectionist interests are involved here and may lie behind these demands
Certainly , we must continue to insist on strict controls
We must equally reject pressures to turn them into thinly - or not so thinly - disguised barriers to trade
We must continue to pursue the eradication of FMD on an international level
To this end , we collaborate closely with international organisations , such as the FAO and the OIE , and will continue to do so
I was deeply concerned to read some of the proposed modifications to the report , which suggested measures that would dismantle the European single market
I therefore congratulate the committee on rejecting most of these suggestions and on its pro-@@ single-@@ market stance
As you are aware , most of our animal health legislation is in the form of directives
This approach provides sufficient flexibility for Member States to implement harmonised measures
However , shortcomings in implementation have certainly contributed to the magnitude of the 2001 FMD epidemic
The Commission has devoted much energy towards improving legislation where necessary and to reinforcing official controls in the Community
One of the key features of the UK epidemic was the huge number of frequently un@@ recorded movements of animals
The Commission has submitted a proposal to reinforce controls on the movement of animals
This proposal in particular introduced for sheep - as regards breeding and production - a mandatory residence of 30 days prior to des@@ patch to another Member State
It also limits the number of assembly operations in assembly centres , approved under more stringent animal health requirements
This has attracted the support of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and of Parliament
The outbreak of FMD in the Netherlands can be directly linked to such a staging point , in France
Movement controls can only be truly effective if there are reliable identification systems in place
It is clear that the major weakness in this respect is in relation to sheep
The current provisions and , in particular , their implementation by Member States have proved to be insufficient to enable the veterinary authorities to trace animals
The Commission is making a new proposal for a regulation to require individual identification of sheep , with the option of future electronic identification
I hope the European Parliament will also support this proposal
I should also mention another major development , the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy
The outcome of the review will have a decisive influence on the future direction of agricultural production in the EU
This in turn cannot be divorced from the health and welfare of animals
One of the features of the mid-term review is the heavier emphasis on quality rather than quantity
I welcome this trend from a consumer perspective
But it should also assist from the perspective of disease avoidance and control
Regarding vaccination , the huge numbers of animals slaughtered and destroyed during the outbreak last year had a profound impact on public opinion
In fact , we have fully to take into account the deeply held views of our citizens
Our approach to FMD has to adapt accordingly
Clearly , the rapid slaughter and disposal of infected or susceptible animals must be an important element in our disease control strategy
Emergency vaccination must also play a central role , as appropriate to the circumstances
There have been deep misunderstandings over the role of vaccination and the Commission 's own position on this issue
I do not propose to repeat today what I have already said on this matter
My remarks now are therefore confined to future policy
The Commission remains of the view that proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination of the entire susceptible livestock population or even particular species is not advisable for sound scientific , technical and economic reasons
The situation in the EU cannot be compared with the endemic FMD situation in South America or elsewhere
FMD is not endemic in the EU , and proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination is not appropriate in the EU
The Commission takes the view that emergency vaccination should , however , be moved to the forefront of the response mechanism in the event of future outbreaks
The means are now available to detect infection in a vaccinated population and the Commission - now supported by the OIE - actively pursues further improvement of these tests
vaccination is not a miracle cure to solve all our problems
I will now turn to contingency planning
There are many lessons to be learned from the events of last year , but they are not necessarily new
Con@@ ting@@ ency plans must be regularly reviewed , updated and tested by periodic sim@@ ulation exercises
The lessons of the outbreak of last year are virtually identical to those of similar outbreaks in the past
The challenge is to act on these lessons
I should like to mention the sensitive issue of compensation for disease-@@ related expenditure incurred by Member States
My services have carried out audits in the UK and the other Member States concerned
Payments to the Member States will be in conformity with the results of these audits
Moreover , the European Court of Auditors is preparing a separate report on the financial aspects of the outbreak
I have taken note of your request for harmonisation of the different compensation schemes applied in Member States
I should recall , however , that the Commission is bound to act on the basis of Council Decision 90/@@ 4@@ 24
The Commission has now finalised the terms of reference for an external review of the current compensation schemes and the elaboration of possible solutions for the future
But we should not be under any illusion that veterinary fund compensation should be made available to all indirectly affected members of the rural community
To conclude , may I praise once again the valuable role played by your committee as regards its contribution to the Commission 's approach to FMD
Much work remains to be done , and the Commission 's proposal for a new directive on FMD will reach Parliament very soon
I trust that the assessment of our proposal by Parliament will benefit from the expertise acquired during the work of the temporary committee
Mr President , firstly I should like to thank Mr Byrne for his statement and all those involved in drawing up this report
When I first brought it to the attention of Parliament , I had no idea that it was going to be the success that it has been
This is the only true public inquiry into foot and mouth
It gave the general public an opportunity to voice its opinion
I shall read from a letter we received from the National Fo@@ ot and M@@ outh Association
'@@ May it suffice to say that without this report , many would not have been able to deal with the epidemic and its effects
I would also like to thank those people who submitted evidence to the Fo@@ ot and M@@ outh Sub@@ committee
We covered businesses right across the European Union
There were people from the United States and many other countries
On one occasion some of my colleagues were sitting there almost with tears in their eyes while listening to the evidence being given
One lady summed it up when she said ' they have taken away our dreams '
That was a direct reference to the British Government
This is why this temporary committee was set up
We needed to see how we could put in amendments to the proposals that Mr Byrne is going to bring out
I look forward with great interest to what Mr Byrne will say
I have one criticism of what he has just said - and here we will have to agree to disagree
Mr Byrne said that he was against any proposal that would control imports from countries where FMD is endemic
I would say to him that we still do not know where this outbreak originated
We do not know exactly how it was brought into the United Kingdom
One thing we found out was that the US , Australia and New Zealand still do not have foot and mouth and they control their imports wholly
I will sum up by saying that we need to change legislation , but we need to change attitudes - welfare , transport , imports
I know the Commission values the findings of this report and I look forward with great interest to its own report
This , however , was not the specific aim of our committee or the reason why it had been set up
The very credibility of our work as parliamentarians depends on this and that is why our group tabled a number of amendments designed to restore balance to the report
Even experts believe that this crisis would have been of the same tragic proportions had it broken out in any other European country
The unfortunate experience of the United Kingdom has enabled other Member States to be more vigilant and better prepared to deal with the disease
What decisions must the European Union take ?
The rapporteur , several of my fellow Members and the Commissioner have just explained
Vi@@ g@@ il@@ ance within Europe 's borders is essential , but we must also increase our controls on imports , both at land borders and at ports and airports
We are at the heart of global trade and people are travelling more and more , and so we must take into account this international dimension
We now await the report on which the Commission is currently working and hope that it will support the conclusions of our temporary committee
About a year ago Mr Sturdy put to me the idea of setting up a committee to investigate the recent foot and mouth disease crisis
I continue to believe that it was a good initiative
Rarely in my career as an MEP have I experienced the degree of interest awakened throughout Europe by this committee
Wherever we went , in the United Kingdom or in the Netherlands , the interest was overwhelming , and to my mind it benefited the European Parliament itself
What have been the high points for the ELDR Group over the past year ?
prevention is better than cure , and we strongly support the call for better border controls
If I arrive at an airport there are scarcely any checks on my luggage , in complete contrast to the situation in other continents
I consider it essential that such measures should also be applied in Europe
There has also been much discussion about whether or not to re-introduce proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination
None of the experts we consulted was in favour
Generally speaking , one cannot assume that a single vaccine exists that will offer protection against the hundred or so different foot and mouth disease strains that are found
It is therefore an illusion to think that there will never be another outbreak
the Commission has been a little par@@ si@@ monious
Agenda 2000 assigns an annual amount of EUR 41 million for the combating of infectious animal diseases
We were fortunate in that the euro exchange rate was rather low and that there were surpluses in the agriculture budget , but that cannot of course continue indefinitely
It would therefore be good if the Commission were to reflect on insurance systems
we have heard appreciation from all sides for the Commission 's role in the foot and mouth crisis
That is the only jar@@ ring note I have to sound in this speech
The rapporteur 's drafting has made the final report fair and a polished piece of work
The advice given by experts to the many hearings was characterised by a consensus that the progress of this disease was to be resisted
The problem here is that - much as with influen@@ za - vaccination only works if the vaccination is derived largely from the same strain as the disease
There is little point in proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination against virus strains , as it is impossible to know in advance which actual FMD virus is being brought in
I would emphasise that emergency vaccination is meant to help prevent foot and mouth disease from spreading
Associ@@ ated with this is the necessity of using suitable measures to at last halt the burgeoning live animal transports across Europe
This is far from being only an animal protection issue; it is about preventing diseases
All the Member States must be able to call upon the services of adequately qualified veterinary personnel in the prevention and treatment of animal diseases
Further scientific investigation is needed into issues associated with emergency vaccination against FMD and the continued use of in@@ oc@@ ulated animals
Mr President , I wish to congratulate the rapporteur on his report , which is extremely important
It is vital that Parliament gives a very strong signal that vaccination should be a tool of first resort in any future outbreak
I am very glad that our committee has come to that conclusion
I am also glad that we support a change in the law so that there is no automatic incentive to slaughter rather than to vaccinate
It is right and proper that we make constructive proposals for the future handling of foot and mouth outbreaks
However , it is also right - where it is called for - that we are strongly critical of the past handling of foot and mouth outbreaks
I , therefore , disagree with the rapporteur that it is inappropriate and unjustified to criticise the UK Government
Such criticism reflects the evidence we heard , and if we do not learn from the past , there is no guarantee of any better action in the future
For that reason , I am saddened by attempts from the British Government to water down this report , to rewrite history and effectively to wh@@ ite@@ wash the past
The government says that a veterinary inspector worked closely at every slaughter
In fact there was often one vet supervising ten slaugh@@ ters simultaneously - an impossible thing to do
The government denies that farmers were intimidated in connection with the cul@@ ls and it asks for evidence
We have evidence in plenty
I would remind them that the committee went to Know@@ stone in Dev@@ on precisely to gather that kind of information
They alle@@ ge that the lessons learnt in the inquiry show that the con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous cull was effective in curbing the disease - again , untrue
The National Audit Office demonstrated that the epidemic had already pe@@ aked before the con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous cull policies could have had any effect
They alle@@ ge that the fire@@ break or pre-emptive culling was legal - again , not true
It is made very clear in the UK 's new contingency plan that fire@@ break or pre-emptive culling requires ' the passage of the new animal health bill '
That bill had not been passed last year and , therefore , such provision did not exist for legally enforceable mandatory fire@@ break cul@@ ls
People would have a lot more respect for this government if it could just bring itself to admit that it got things wrong
There are many lessons to be learnt from the experiences of the outbreak
The rapporteur has done an excellent job in highlighting these and in showing how to avoid the mistakes of the past
I am pleased that the Commission has been most cooperative with the temporary committee throughout the period of its work
I seriously hope that the committee 's final recommendations will be fully reflected in the forthcoming legislative proposal
In particular , I would urge that close attention be paid to those areas where resource gaps have been identified
In conclusion , I sincerely hope that this lengthy exercise will bring about some very tangible results
The Member States , as well as the Commission , have clear responsibilities in this area
Legislation on catering waste , animal transport , animal welfare , surveillance and disease control must be properly implemented and monitored
I fully support measures leading to a ban on all meat imports from non-EU countries where foot and mouth is endemic and likewise support stricter controls on illegal meat imports
In this context , however , the Commission had assumed statutory responsibility for dict@@ ating the nature of planning undertaken by Member States - the so-called contingency planning
It should also have monitored its adequacy
Therefore , notwithstanding the obvious and manifest failing of the British authorities in this respect , clearly the Commission 's performance was disastrous
Righ@@ tly , the temporary committee had identified this lamentable lack of diligence on the part of the Commission
Yet what is missing from this report is any indication of why the Commission failed so manifestly in its duty
stressed by the national veterinary authorities of Member States concerned '
Our committee has , on the whole , done a good job
We must therefore ensure that we maintain a network of family-run farms of a manageable siz@@ e; this is the best possible way to prevent foot and mouth disease
When hundreds of millions of people are starving , it is unacceptable to destroy the meat of millions of healthy animals , which is what happened in 2001
On this point , however , I regret the fact that the Commission did not make bolder proposals
This possibility should be left to the discretion of the Member States , which are best placed to assess the consequences of specific risks for their livestock
It is an absolute necessity that these rules are developed
This is especially true of Europe , which is surrounded by countries where foot and mouth is endemic
This is particularly true of Turkey , which represents a constant danger , and the rest of the Middle East and North Africa too
There have also been a number of outbreaks in Asia and Latin America
The globalisation of the live animal trade can therefore only encourage and accentuate the globalisation of diseases and viruses
These methods are dictated by common sense and are the best possible way to prevent the development of new diseases
We all remember the great number of animals which had to be cul@@ led following the outbreak last year which seriously affected the United Kingdom and the Netherlands
And the main task of this committee was to prevent situations such as that caused by this disease from re@@ occurring in Europe
Many of the people invited to the committee occupied very important posts during the management of the last outbreak of the disease
The fruit of all this work is the report being presented today for the vote of this House
The policy of emergency vaccination must be part of a strategy which allows animals to live
Ladies and gentlemen , another of the most important aspects of the work of this committee relates to the control of imports
This House should insist on this issue and must remind the Commission that it cannot ignore the problem of illegal imports
The great food crises are always based on non-@@ compli@@ ances with Community legislation
In the same way , the temporary committee is asking the Commission to draw up a global strategy for diseases and zoonosis in the European Union
For all these reasons , I would ask that the House give this report its majority support
Mr President , bad farming practice was the root cause of the foot and mouth outbreak
Pi@@ gs were fed improperly treated swill , which was bad farming practice
Dis@@ eased pigs were not reported - bad farming practice
B@@ ad farming practice was compounded by stupidity when pigs which no longer showed physical symptoms but could still transmit the disease were sent to an abattoir
Other animals became infected and this delayed the identification of the source of the outbreak
The outbreak farm was so severely infected that it was six months before it was safe to dis@@ infect it
B@@ ad farming practice led to a situation where the disease was spre@@ ade@@ ag@@ led over 57 farms in 16 counties by the time its presence was confirmed
The result was the worst foot and mouth outbreak ever recorded , well beyond the contingency planning of any Member State
The report does not shirk the horrendous consequences to farmers and to rural businesses , the hear@@ tac@@ he , the trauma and the financial losses
Nor does the report shirk the operational problems faced by government
The report is particularly good - indeed it is its main strength - on the measures needed to combat any future outbreak
Of special importance is the need for effective monitoring of animal movements and traceability
That said , regrettably the report contains errors of fact
They also relate to allegations of animal welfare abuses and to bio@@ security lapses allowing further spread of the disease
Eight amendments have been tabled to correct these errors
As the Chair said so reve@@ al@@ ingly during the committee vote , we are not dealing with reality
H@@ ear@@ say and hindsight have been the chief witnesses
The reality is that the con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous cull was legal
It was legal under UK law; it was legal under European law
The cull was an essential weapon in bringing the disease under control
Vaccination would not have worked in the UK situation
That was the reality
The report , as many speakers have said , is judicious and balanced
It is bold and forthright in exactly the right areas , particularly on vaccination and import controls
The report conve@@ ys some very clear messages about what should be avoided in the future and what should be done in the horrific eventuality that another outbreak occurs
On both of those points , it is clear that the report has already had an influence on the shift in public policy which is starting in the United Kingdom
Insufficient resources have been allocated to that important task
I see that the PSE Group and the rapporteur have tabled some amendments to protect the reputation of the United Kingdom Government
I would only suggest to my colleagues that they should not be so over-@@ sensitive
It is simply part and parcel of the independence of a committee of inquiry such as this that there should be some critical remarks
Frankly , it is an aspect of independence that the government has deliberately sh@@ un@@ ned by refusing to hold its own public inquiry in the UK
Some of the amendments which have been retabled seem to be just plain wrong
I pick out arbitrarily an amendment which says that there was no evidence of health or environmental problems arising from some of the burial sites in the south-west
If they speak to any of the residents in that locality , they will see what a silly amendment that is
Finally , I would ask colleagues to pay particular attention to paragraph 1@@ 28 of the draft report
The ELDR Group will be asking for a split vote to delete the last sentence of paragraph 1@@ 28
That last sentence suggests that any compensation in future should be conditional on appropriate insurance mechanisms being in place
The second factor is that cross-border veterinary checks on movements of livestock between Member States of the European Union have all but been abolished
This basically means that animals can move unchecked from one country to another , as can any dangerous diseases they may be carrying
Any structural or other measures taken will be no more than fragmented measures which work until the next crisis strikes
Mr President , I wish to say at the outset that the committee is very grateful that we secured this inquiry
As we are all aware , the initial decision to hold an inquiry was not without its difficulties
It was opposed by the UK Government , which also expressed misgivings as to the duration of the inquiry
It felt that six months was sufficient
However , we would never have accomplished what we did had we not been allowed a 12-@@ month duration
That was vital for us to undertake the task asked of us
If animals were cul@@ led on this scale with no proven blood-@@ tested evidence , it was a clear and blatant violation of animal welfare , and on a large scale
In future we must have proper contingency planning
It is quite astounding that the government of the day in the UK had no tried and tested contingency plan in place
The epidemic in the UK was a catalogue of errors
Regions like my own had no idea at all how to tackle the situation and no powers devolved to them to undertake their task of tackling it effectively
In the interests of communities everywhere throughout Europe , it is vital that the same mistakes are not allowed to happen again
what went well this year , what went wrong , and what needs improving
if only we had not agreed the policy of non-vaccination in 1991
The costs of that policy have been greatly underestimated
But worse still is the fact that the non-vaccination policy with the accompanying cul@@ ls where there is an outbreak , fails to meet any ethical test
Mr President , No@@ ah 's ar@@ k was filled not with production factors , but with living creatures
As the stewards of creation we must take that to heart
Parties who do not wish for such a test , should pay the penalty at the ballot box for the consequences of a foot and mouth outbreak
Much more far-reaching consequences than simply economic ones are involved
To call the combating of the foot and mouth crisis a veterinary success , as has been suggested from the liberal side , is to lose all sense of proportion
The combating of foot and mouth was not a success , neither veterinary , nor economic , nor in terms of communication
The report admits that
An exception is a clause on Fri@@ es@@ land , where according to the draft text there was optimum involvement of regional experts
F@@ act and fiction have been confused here
An amendment that I submitted jointly with fellow MEPs Mr Maat and Mr De Roo attempted to restore a correct version of events
For years proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination protected our livestock
In conclusion I should like to compliment the rapporteur on his courageous , lucid and valuable report
The same also applies to our secretariat , since our work as a temporary committee consisted to a significant degree precisely in visiting people who had been affected
Mr President , Mrs Redondo 's words are close to my heart
It gives them the feeling that in this instance European democracy really came into its own
That strikes me as essential , partly also with a view to the forthcoming elections in 2004
Such was the impact
I will just mention the story of the school in O@@ ene , where performance at primary level declined
That indicates the impact this crisis had on people
This means that if we are to take European citizens seriously , we must change policy
In that sense I am glad that Commissioner Byrne at least has indicated that he appreciates this
That means that the area would be cut off for no longer than 3 months and that there will be free marketing of products
That is crucial if a future policy is to succeed
I have already indicated that this committee tried to give European citizens a voice in European politics
In that respect I look forward to the new debate on the Commission 's proposals
The Commission and the Council have a heavy responsibility
They cannot brush aside this report by Parliament
They must take this report on board in their policy , or else we shall find ourselves in new difficulties regarding democracy in Europe
He has done a splendid job , and his objective approach has made it possible to bridge political differences
Also rage at Europe , which for@@ b@@ ade the vaccination of livestock in the area surrounding affected farms
The European Parliament is today presenting a closely argued view , a view that I can endorse entirely
Yes , we are against the unnecessary culling of healthy animals
Yes , we want vaccination in the event of foot and mouth outbreaks
Yes we must persuade supermarkets to sell the meat of vaccinated animals as a matter of course
Yes , there must be emergency action plans
We must introduce a global dimension , a clear statement must be issued by the OIE and there must be effective monitoring of imports , including at airports
We must also ensure good monitoring at all times
I am in complete agreement with all these points
A political wish list is not enough
As long as the European Parliament has no say in the agricultural field , there is a risk that our resolution will remain a paper tiger
Unless we link this resolution to concerted pressure in the Convention , all our efforts will have been in vain
Worse still , we shall have awakened unfounded expectations and we shall be fuelling renewed Euro@@ scepticism
In the Netherlands , the 2001 foot and mouth crisis was a kind of har@@ b@@ ing@@ er of the political upheaval in 2002
We must also at any rate learn the political lesson
Confidence in politics suffered a heavy blow
An important reason was that political responsibility remained vague , since who was actually responsible for the non-vaccination policy ?
Was it the government , was it the EU or the international bureau for infectious diseases ?
Ministers pointed to the EU , the EU Commissioners pointed to the national governments and the OIE
For citizens , the complex structure of responsibilities was scarcely comprehensible , and that created the impression of politicians who took up positions but subsequently preferred to hide behind others
Politicians who shirk responsibility destroy the credibility of politics
This game of buck passing has back@@ fired badly on Europe
The hundreds of angry letters and angry e-mails were the signs of a human but also an interinstitutional tragedy
A future foot and mouth outbreak must never lead to a mass slaughter of livestock
In the period ahead , we must direct all our efforts to this end
This requires a foot and mouth policy in which responsibilities are clearly established , at regional , national , European and international level
Parliaments must be involved
Our aim must be a foot and mouth policy that is not anonymous
Respon@@ sibilities for choices and for compliance must be clearly established , and it is our task to communicate these
I hope that this report may contribute to this process and again thank the rapporteur
Unfortunately , the work has not shown unambiguously that there is any alternative to the present non-vaccination policy
This means that , if a decision on vaccination is to be made , it will be a political decision and not a decision based on scientific and veterinary fact
I want finally to say a little about the consequences in terms of trade policy
The reactions have been very clear
On the contrary , supply and demand become totally chaotic when that happens
That is why I want very clearly to call upon the Commission to renegotiate the agreements , which are nowhere near specific enough at present
Mr President , foot and mouth disease was not created by human error , as was the mad cow disease BSE , but is a long familiar natural phenomenon
It used to be considered normal for every cow to be affected by it occasionally , thereby building up immunity
Later people attempted to eradicate once and for all that disease that was infectious , expensive , dirty and painful for livestock by means of vaccination
Without extreme globalisation and the world market the disease and the way in which people believe they can combat it would never have attracted so much attention
The rich American market does not want meat from animals that have been sick
Simply because , without marker vaccine , we cannot easily distinguish such animals from vaccinated livestock , people became confident that the disease would gradually be eliminated entirely
Just as people believed this of human tuberculosis
Export interests have replaced animal welfare and human ingen@@ u@@ ity
Unfortunately the mistake was made not only by a number of companies or whole Member States but also by the European Union as a whole
For ten years Member States and our farmers have been pres@@ sured from above into collaborating in something that is neither sensible nor acceptable
Even rare and ex@@ otic breeds or the pet animals of country children were compul@@ s@@ orily killed
Quite rightly many people declared authorities that compel such behaviour insane and withdrew their confidence
Thus far Ministers of Agriculture and the European Commission may have admitted that things may change in the distant future but they have not yet changed course entirely
V@@ acc@@ inations are seen at most as an emergency measure for healthy livestock that cannot be destroyed quickly enough
As is often the case government power is more stupid than human society as a whole
So many people are protesting
Mr President , foot and mouth disease is a highly infectious disease for our livestock , but completely harmless to humans
I come from the Netherlands where our cattle were proph@@ yl@@ ac@@ tically vaccinated for over 60 years
The United Kingdom , Denmark and Ireland do not have this tradition
After their entry into the European Union they lobbied for 20 years for the abolition of proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination in Europe
Export interests were placed above all else
The proposal of the temporary committee is to make emergency vaccination easier
That is a good idea
There is also a proposal to force supermarkets to sell vaccinated meat in future
The latter smacks of a planned economy and will not work
The Netherlands produces far more meat than the Dutch themselves can consume
What is necessary is a return to proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination
At least for those countries , like the Netherlands , that wish to do so
New techniques , such as marker vaccines make it possible to distinguish between a sick animal and one that has been vaccinated
That means that even the sacred exports can be maintained
It is a mystery to me why the majority in Parliament does not opt for this approach
For me this report is only half a step in the right direction
Nevertheless , half steps in the right direction are better than no steps at all , and I shall vote in favour of the report
But I am bound to say that I find it a great pity that our agricultural colleagues in particular have made the interests of direct exports paramount
Mr President , I am very glad to say that the health crisis is behind us , but its side effects are unresolved
The first thing we must do is understand
Unfortunately , at this juncture , we can still only speculate as to the source of the infection and the factors that caused the disease to spread
It is clear that we cannot repeat a slaughter on such a huge scale
These prevention programmes should also take into account the conservation of genetic resources while wild species , game and dying breeds must be protected through specific measures
Lastly , prevention programmes will only be effective if adequate compensation is guaranteed
I would particularly like to thank Mr Kreissl-Dörfler for his unstinting work , his readiness to listen and his even-handed approach
The visits to the UK and the Netherlands allowed us to listen to everyone who was affected
I believe that the European Parliament has delivered what my own parliament in West@@ min@@ ster would not
What we have in this document is a fair and balanced report on the terrible devastation and suffering the disease brought to my country
Let us not forget that foot and mouth disease is no respec@@ ter of borders
This blight could have appeared in any European country and could still hit at any time in the future
Looking at the situation in the UK , the British Government quite simply got it wrong
There is no denying that mistakes have been made
That could be accepted by British farmers - we all make mistakes
What is not acceptable is that this government still refuses to accept they got it wrong and still refuses to apologise to those who suffered
Look at Mr Adam 's amendments and look at the latest British Government briefing - they have learnt nothing
This disease did not just affect farmers , it affected hotels and tour@@ is@@ m; it affected butchers and traders across Europe
We must not allow this terrible slaughter of 10 million animals to happen again
I am pleased that this report contains a sensible and workable approach to vaccination in the future
Our visit to the Netherlands demonstrated the great benefits of emergency vaccination
This would remove the necessity for the huge funeral py@@ res and burial p@@ its that were hallmarks of the British Government 's handling of the outbreak
Those un@@ forge@@ t@@ table pictures must stand as a lasting reminder of what could happen again if we do not learn the lessons of this most terrible disease
I am pleased that this report sets out plans for the future
It is vital that we have a workable and effective contingency plan in place
This report goes a long way to developing a positive approach for the whole of Europe
The European Commission has worked hand in hand with the committee , and it is no coincidence that tomorrow it will come forward with its proposals for the future
I commend Commissioner Byrne 's team for their work
please listen and accept this report so we can plan for the future
The suffering caused last year by foot and mouth disease was simply unacceptable and it must never be allowed to happen again
I hope you will all support this report and the measures contained within it
Europe 's farmers and Europe 's rural communities deserve to know that they are valued
They deserve to know that Europe 's politicians are prepared
I hope that you will give this your support today
Mr President , no one on the temporary committee will ever forget the aftermath of that great foot and mouth plague of 2001
It has to begin with the outbreak itself , with what actually happened and with the appor@@ tion@@ ment of blame
A balanced report is one in which all those responsible accept some measure of the blame , including the UK Government
I would point out to the House that there have been five separate reports in the UK alone , two by local authorities severely affected by the crisis
There have also been reports by the National Farmers Union and others who were participants in the whole tragedy
So to say that this is the first time we have looked at this is quite wrong
Mr Kreissl-Dörfler has produced an objective account and one which seeks to be fair in its allocation of blame and responsibility
I am sorry that some of the amendments that have been tabled run counter to that intention
We should not be attempting 20@@ :@@ 20 hindsight
We should not be using shock logic to invent legal rules that were allegedly broken
The past is being rewritten here
Some of the allegations in Mrs Lucas 's speech were factually incorrect and should not be in this report at all
Firstly , the foreign vets , more than 2 000 of whom came to the UK and tried to help us solve the problems with the outbreak
Finally , I would like to thank the Commissioner
It is right that it should be this Commissioner with his concerns and priorities who is replying in this debate
Essentially , it is a matter , not just of animal health , but of human health and welfare as well
All too often the cries of those people whose economy depended on tourists and whose contribution to the economy was worth six times that of the farmers went totally unheeded
mountains , h@@ ills and foot@@ paths were closed for no reason
At the same time , you could walk along a country road and the sheep and lambs would stick their heads out through the f@@ ences
People felt a sense of anger and despair
I must say that our positions have now grown closer together , whereas at that time they were still rather more divergent
At that time , the Commission still took another view
I concede that the international organisations took yet another line on the question of when in@@ oc@@ ulation should take place
Now we have moved on a bit , and I call that progress
I believe that targeted vaccination will enable us to limit the damage , in material but also in cultural terms
The scandals associated with foot and mouth disease and the burning py@@ res gave the world an image of Europe that we must not allow to be repeated
Let me just say something on the subject of pro@@ phy@@ lax@@ is
I am not in favour of constant proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination , but we must also make it clear that control vaccination always amounts to proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination
The right time for this has to be identified , and this is where the Commission has to watch out
We also have to give the Member States leeway to enable us to have ring-@@ vaccination and control vaccination at an early stage
That does not , however , necessarily include ongoing proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination , to which I wish to express my opposition
Mr President , this committee and its report have been an extremely good exercise
I would like to congratulate all my colleagues , particularly Mr Sturdy for initiating it , the Chairman Mrs Redondo Jiménez and the rapporteur Mr Kreissl-Dörfler
A lot has already been said about ' to vaccinate or not to vaccinate ' , be it proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination , ring vaccination , emergency vaccination or contingency vaccination
The one thing we have agreed upon is that we are not going back down the route of proph@@ yl@@ actic vaccination
At least that is what this report is saying , and I think that makes sense
I would like to concentrate on one point that concerns me greatly and that is the future availability of veterinary resources , particularly in remote regions of the European Union
There is sure to be another outbreak of an ex@@ otic disease - if not foot and mouth - with the movement of people and animals and modern travel today
I urge the Commission to take particular interest and to evaluate the availability of veterinary resources for future disease management within the EU generally
Id@@ enti@@ fication of animals , issues of transport , insurance and many other matters came up apart from the vaccination issue
I urge sensible handling of transport and the individual identification of animals
I congratulate Jo@@ e Wal@@ sh and Bri@@ d Ro@@ gers for their great cooperation , which resulted in the worst of this outbreak being avoided in Ireland
Mr President , we are dealing with an excellent parliamentary report which is flexible , courageous , balanced and positive , in a very difficult field
Firstly , it brings up to date areas which were not covered , such as the vulnerability of sectors like tourism
Secondly , it introduces flexible innovations in relation to emergency vaccination , rejecting the obsolete elements of the current regulations
Thirdly , it criticises the shortcomings , but in a positive manner
Fourthly , it points out the in@@ suffici@@ encies of information policies
Fifthly , I very much agree with paragraphs 81 and 82 on compensation
Mr President , firstly I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and to all involved in bringing about this report
It is a balanced report and has been a good initiative
It has been good for this Parliament because it has proved that it could produce a report that the national parliament was afraid to
I would like to comment on one of the Commissioner 's remarks
This report and investigation brought home the wider effects
Coming , as it did , on the back of BSE in the United Kingdom , this disease wrecked the rural economy and destroyed many farmers in the UK
I come from Northern Ireland , and Mrs Doyle has referred to the fact that she comes from the Republic of Ireland
The reality is that we were very lucky
What will remain with us is the sight on our TV screens of the burning py@@ res
It brought home to us how horrific the situation was
There has to be a better way of controlling it
R@@ ing vaccination has to be the way in which we look at trying to control it
We should put in place more resources and more finance for research and development to achieve a traceable vaccine , so we know that animals have been vaccinated
border controls are totally inefficient
Meat is being brought into the European Community , into the United Kingdom and other countries , and it is not being caught
We are going to have to deal with this as other countries have done
We must ensure that our ports and airports are properly controlled in every way
The truth is that this disease can strike anywhere and at any time
This is not just about a few cows and sheep
I would also like to unambiguously refute the accusations - and there have been some - levelled at farmers , be it in Great Britain or any other country
We all know that meat from vaccinated animals is completely safe and therefore capable of being marketed
I would like to express my gratitude to our rapporteur , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler
I would like to thank Mrs Redondo Jiménez , who chaired our committee , and also the Commission , and those of its members who were of assistance to us
I trust that you will all now go and enjoy a nice ju@@ icy steak
Mr President , in this Chamber we are very frequently engaged in debating what we consider to be the great political issues
But I seem to remember that when we were elected in 1999 our greatest concern was how we made our debates relevant to our electors
This debate is very relevant to people in my constituency who suffered from what has been described as a community tragedy
There was an impact on a really human scale
That addresses , in my view , the issue of the relevance of the European Parliament
Setting up the committee has been a worthwhile exercise
Secondly , I am sorry we had such difficulty in establishing the committee
I am sorry it was such a struggle
We all recognise that it was just one group that was opposed to setting up the committee
Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , though coming from that group , has been a parag@@ on in approaching this issue in a non-@@ political way
His report is first-rate
His report has endeavoured to address the real core issues that are of concern
Others have touched upon the details
this is a report that had almost universal support in committee
I am sorry that some additional amendments have been tabled because we should cling to the consensus that is within the report
It is the best example , in my view , of the European Parliament addressing the concerns of voters in a practical way
It is a huge example for the future relevance of the European Parliament
We are engaged in much more important things than that
I ask you to look at the report as it came out of the committee and to respond accordingly , Commissioner
Commissioner , I support Mr Kreissl-Dörfler 's report and I congratulate him on the unanimous consensus reached in the Temporary Committee on Fo@@ ot and M@@ outh Dis@@ ease
In this regard , Commissioner , we need to reflect carefully and at length on the role of the public veterinary services
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Temporary Committee on Fo@@ ot and M@@ outh Dis@@ ease has had some important observations to make on the handling of last year 's crisis
It has defined necessary strategies for the future , which also incorporate important suggestions for the legislative work on which we are about to embark
Are we supposed to use protective emergency vaccination at the right moment ?
I would add flexibility in ring-@@ vaccination
Vaccination and testing should , in principle , be the primary option and should become standard practice
The trade restriction should be reduced to three months at most , as advised by the Scientific Committee as long ago as 1999
I will add one very important point , quite without reference to the forthcoming legislative work
I believe that what is needed is to achieve social consensus on the part of everyone involved
Mr President , as some colleagues may know , I live in Cumbria at the heart of last year 's foot and mouth outbreak
I and many of my friends , neighbours and constituents lost our animals
For us the py@@ res were not on the television screen , they were over the garden fence
I would merely like to make four comments
This loss , which flow@@ ed directly from what the government was doing and was entirely foreseeable , was equally real
Their contribution to the fight against the disease was equally valid
In my view , an injustice has been done to them
Thirdly , the evidence now emerging in Cumbria suggests that the public health consequences of the outbreak are much wi@@ der-@@ ranging and much longer-@@ lasting than was supposed at the time
learn the lessons of 2001
Do not let other people go through what we did last year
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too wish to start by thanking our rapporteur , Mr Kreissl-Dörfler , for his collegi@@ al cooperation in the temporary committee
I am equally grateful to Mrs Redondo , who guided the committee very constructively and with great diplomacy and calm@@ ness
I would also like to thank all my colleagues
I am also most grateful to the Commission for always having been there with us and for doing its bit
What makes foot and mouth disease especially problematic is that it is highly infectious and is therefore easily passed from one animal to another
I therefore see it as self-evident that bureaucratic procedures and an inadequate information policy must no longer be allowed to be the causes of the spread of a disease
Nevertheless , it must be clear to all of us that unfortunately epizo@@ o@@ tics can break out again in future , whatever is done to prevent them
Mr President , Commissioner , the message from this morning 's debate was that ' prevention is better than cure '
The recurrent refrain was that , in future , all-round improvements to systems will be required as a matter of necessity
It is important that any future changes in policy should take as their starting point an analysis of how the disease has been handled up to now
What I will now say , I say as one who comes from the region bordering on the Netherlands , with a very high number of gran@@ i@@ vores
We must , yet again , draw attention to the need for better networking when cooperating on an acute case of the disease
You have to think of it as a practice exercise for fire@@ fighters , a call@@ -out without a fire
What was called for was the most rapid reaction in case X , and this cross-border cooperation between the Netherlands and Germany achieved a really most impressive result
Let us all hope that this exercise never has to be done for real
We are backing the Commission 's proposals
Mr Sturdy said just now that , even today , there are people who do not understand how all this could have happened or where the epidemic came from
In particular , I thank them for allowing the committee to visit North@@ umberland , in my region , where the disease originated
There is much anecdo@@ tal evidence in the UK that large amounts of illegal meat are still entering the country
I would ask the Commissioner to address that in his response tomorrow , because it is a time bomb waiting to go off
The disease could easily happen again anywhere in Europe
People were particularly grateful to have the opportunity to submit their comments to the committee members in person
Mr President , I am very pleased to have the opportunity to respond to this valuable and important debate on this report
A number of issues have been raised by many speakers which I ought to address - even if only briefly at this stage
Firstly , on the question of control of imports , many - if not all - of you have addressed this important issue
It is the job of the Commission to bring forward legislation on the control of imports
With regard to legislation , since 1972 we have legislation in place at EU level in respect of imports of commercial products
It is illegal to import goods in contravention of that legislation
More recently , we have put in place legislation on personal imports , which will be operational from 1 January 2003
I , like you , call on Member States to ensure that their control authorities make sure that these pieces of legislation are properly and fully implemented
This issue is also addressed in the hygiene regulations before Parliament at the moment
Therefore , cooperation of all parties in this is of critical importance in trying to ensure that another outbreak does not happen in the future
The second issue that was raised with some passion is vaccination
I noted what Mr Whitehead said about the past constantly changing
However , in this instance there is one point that I have had to address on many occasions
It was again raised by Mrs Corbey and Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf
It is the function of the Commission in the application of vaccinations
Two Member States out of the four that had the outbreak of foot and mouth disease sought permission from the Commission to administer emergency vaccination
That permission was granted - there is no doubt about that
One of those two Member States did not apply it all , the other did , but then decided that the animals that were vaccinated should be killed
They had permission from the Commission to vaccinate and keep the animals alive
Any of the Member States involved could have applied vaccinations of their own vo@@ lition , based on their own legislation , without any need for permission from the Commission
That did not happen , although it could have been done because the Commission authorised this in very clear terms
I am very happy that a number of speakers praised the work of the Commission
I am sure that the people who work with me , my collabor@@ ators who are here , take pleasure in that also
I am very pleased that the two institutions have worked so well together in this instance , as Mr Jonathan Evans said
We have tried to ensure that what we do here at European Union level - whether in Parliament or in the Commission - has relevance for people
In this instance , the debate and the report have been of relevance to citizens of the European Union
One further piece of legislation to be published tomorrow governs the individual identification and traceability of sheep
That will also contribute to providing some kind of security against an outbreak of this type in the future
This is a clear example of the two institutions working very well and effectively together for the benefit of the citizens of the European Union
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 11
( The sitting was suspended at 11
Mr President , I would like to request that the vote on the Damião report on asbestos be added to the voting list today
It is a matter of urgency
We have only the three amendments before us that were voted in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs
No new amendments have been tabled here in plenary
Those amendments have been available for over two weeks in translation
If we can vote today , the college of Commissioners , as I understand it , could consider the matter this afternoon
It can then be taken at Council on Friday of this week under the Danish Presidency
The Danish Presidency has worked very hard to agree these amendments with us , and this would allow us to close the dossier at second reading without going into conciliation
I hope it can be added to the voting list today
Am I right in thinking that Mrs Thors wishes to speak on this matter ?
I am therefore forced to take the floor now instead
What is at issue here is Mr Tony B@@ un@@ yan 's complaint to the Ombudsman , the outcome of which is a success for Parliament , the Ombudsman and Mr B@@ un@@ yan
Through our work , a long conflict between the institutions about what characterises a document , as distinct from more incidental papers , was resolved
The Council had refused to give the complainant access to documentation on the grounds that the documents were ep@@ hem@@ eral or only reflected the views of individuals
I therefore suggest that you wait and I shall let you know when you may take your two minutes ' speaking time
We received a request from Mr Hughes , who suggested that we take the vote on the Damião report today
Mr President , I support the request made by Mr Hughes
It is very important that we vote on it today
There is no real problem concerning this report , so we can vote on it today
Is there a Member who wishes to speak against Mr Hughes ' request to take the vote on the Damião report today ?
The vote will therefore take place after the vote on the Langenhagen report
Re@@ introducing vaccination , especially since we now have detection tests that are capable of distinguishing ser@@ o@@ logically between viral infection and immu@@ no@@ logical response to the vaccine , is the correct solution
There were 3@@ 20 000 cases of infection in France in 19@@ 52 compared to 2 0@@ 30 at the peak of the UK crisis in 2001
Ten years after vaccination was introduced , there were as few as 148 cases , and 30 years on , only 18
The costs incurred by the epidemic are greater than the costs of vaccination
As for the commercial need , it is extraordinary that this argument should be used when it is internal national consumption that absor@@ bs most of the production
Unless , of course , foot and mouth disease was merely a pretext for getting rid of surplus meat and avoiding storage costs
I want what the Council said added to the minutes , so that my fellow MEPs might know what the answer was
A long conflict between the institutions about what constitutes a document and what are more incidental papers has been resolved
The Council had refused to give documentation to the complainant , Mr Tony B@@ un@@ yan , on the grounds that the documents were ep@@ hem@@ eral or only reflected the thinking of individuals
Everyone who has come into contact with the decision-making process knows that precisely these documents are important
Following the reading by the Committee on Petitions , the Council has promised to introduce a new practice
The Council 's list of documents is to be complete and so also include texts distributed at the meetings of the Council
This means that the arrangement we adopted previously will operate still better and that the public will more easily be able to follow the decision-making process
I would cite the letter sent by Mr Brun@@ may@@ r , Director-General of the Council Secretariat
Mr President , I wonder if it is possible to get a set of headphones
I do not appear to have a set at my desk and I must apologise to Mrs Thors , my Finnish is not that great
Either you take intensive courses in the 11 EU languages , or we give you a pair of headphones immediately
I think we should take the second option
Mr President , Amendment No 14 was tabled by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party
That is why , personally speaking , I approve this amendment
Mr President , this concerns the translation into English of the term ' lo@@ i organ@@ ique ' , which has been rendered as ' organic law '
We are not very familiar with this concept in the English language
I propose that we harmonise our Engl@@ ish-@@ language terminology with that of the Commission , which would make things clearer all around
I suggest that all the versions are reviewed in the light of your comment , Mr Corbett , so that we are all clear on this point
Given the time , I suggest we suspend voting and resume immediately after the formal sitting for the presentation of the Sakharov Prize
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , before we move to the final vote , I would just like to say a few words
Never before , in eight years , have I taken the floor after a report , but I think it appropriate that I do so today
There is no doubt that some of the amendments on which we voted today are perfectly in order
We were also concerned to give the report a coherent form
What I would like to say is that I am very glad that the Greens ' Amendment No 25 was rejected
You simply have to bear that in mind
It may be all very fine as far as protecting animals is concerned , but there is no political mil@@ e@@ age in it at all
That is why I am very glad that the amendment was rejected
We are obviously unable to endorse a directive of this nature
On the pretext of ' streamlining ' , the text calls for a reduction of the productive capacities of these countries
If the European Parliament wishes to punish war crimes , it should start by putting its own house in order
It is not the population that the French army is protecting there , but French money
G@@ et the French army out of Côte d' Ivoire
As for the report , it re@@ e@@ ks of hypocrisy , and that is why we voted against it
Cru@@ el intimidation and the murder of civilians were an accepted tool used for engaging in territorial expansion and securing economic spheres of interest
The military was above the law
Not until 1945 , after the defeat of Germany and Japan in the Second World War , were war criminals from those countries convicted by the victors
Or is the designation of war criminal equally applicable to those responsible for the destruction of D@@ res@@ den , Hi@@ roshima and N@@ agas@@ ak@@ i ?
Evidently one needs to be the loser in a war to be tried and sentenced after that war
Despite that selective approach , it is good that crimes should be punished , even if an attempt is made to justify them in terms of the ex@@ i@@ gencies of war
In this way we can discourage repetition in future
Unfortunately the Kirkhope report offers mainly a policy of har@@ assing refugees accused by their political opponents of having dirty hands
It will scarcely help us to prevent future crimes of rulers against their people
I have therefore voted in favour of the report
I wish to congratulate Mr S@@ ousa P@@ into on the quality and the boldness of his report
I agree with his criticism of the Danish proposal 's lack of ambition and scant substance
No progress has been made on the mutual recognition of judgments and we are still a long way off from implementing the principle of the mutual recognition of sentencing
We must fulfil the desire expressed in Tampere and Laeken to make the principle of the mutual recognition of judgments in criminal matters effective
The issue of the recognition of judgments in criminal matters is highly sensitive , and raises delicate issues
British Conservative MEPs do not believe that mutual recognition is necessary in this field
Dis@@ qualifications should remain a matter for intergovernmental cooperation
As such the British Conservative Delegation supports the rejection of this Council proposal
I have therefore supported this report and agreed with rejecting the Danish initiative as the rapporteur proposed and as the specialist parliamentary committee accepted
Un@@ able to achieve the consensus necessary in the Council , or to honour their commitments in national legislation , the Member States are using and abusing their right of initiative
We must put an end to this situation
This is the message that the European Parliament wishes to send to the Council and to the Member States
We are in favour of the development of scientific research and its applications in all the areas that can help move humanity forward
It is quite simply that the report seems to think that this goes without saying
We reject the fact that this pretext is once again being used so that public money can be employed to bolster private profits
The only reason that we are abstaining instead of voting against this report is because it also provides some subsidies which could help researchers and state and university research
One of the problems that is fundamental but all too often neglected by scientific research in Europe is that of the flagrant under-representation of women
This report is based on the misguided principle that aid granted by the EDF falls within the sphere of Community competence
It has been clearly proven that the nature of relations between the various Member States and the countries receiving development aid is quite different
This is partly a result of historical factors and old ties which , in many cases , such as Portugal , lead to relationships involving very close cooperation
These relationships are expressed in frameworks that can only be identified and given due consideration in the context of consultation with the Council itself
I disagree with communitarisation and have therefore voted against the report
The number of people who have taken part in the Erasmus programme since its inception will exceed one million during the academic year 2002 to 2003
A total of 30 countries presently take part
I welcome the fact that the European Union is now putting in place a charter for Erasmus students which will be available to all students in 2003
It is the goal of the European Commission and Parliament to reach two million participating students by 2007
The Youth for Europe programme has been very successful in encouraging more exchanges between students
We should encourage further development of this area , in particular for those who are disadvantaged
When will there be a ' Young at heart for Europe ' programme ? '
This motion concerns the Court of Auditors ' report on the application of the Socrates and Youth programmes
The motion contains worthwhile comments and proposals
It calls on the Commission to act on the Court of Auditors ' recommendations , including its recommendation to replace the TAOs by Community public-@@ law agencies
It also calls for any ' framework ' contracts with external bodies to be phased out and for monitoring and evaluation to be awarded to public bodies
There also appears to be some doubt as to the efficacy of the programmes themselves
These programmes aggres@@ sively impose the Euro-@@ unifying education model in the field of education and youth and are designed to familiarise young people with so-called European ideals
Having taken all these factors into account , the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece abstained from voting
I therefore feel - and I had to vote for the report - that , with this system , the terrorists will be van@@ qu@@ ished
How will the terrorists be able to resist the mer@@ ma@@ ids ?
it allows bodies , particularly from third countries , to have easy access to information of a personal nature , without any sort of contro@@ l;
it provides no guarantees that every proposal for the SIS 's functioning will be approved by the Schengen Joint Supervisory Au@@ thor@@ ity;
The Schengen Information System is an electronic system for recording , identifying and monitoring suspects and is used purely for policing and repressive purposes
We would remind the House that the Schengen Information System started up in 1995 , well before 11 September 2001
) should have access to the system and that it should extend to new data categories
This is an anti-democratic initiative and the grass-roots movement is fighting to reject both it and the Schengen Information System itself
Despite the fact that there is insufficient clarity about modalities , particularly supervision and data protection
The rights of citizens are therefore insufficiently guaranteed in this proposal
The Convention has been bled almost dry by a virtual IGC with the arrival of numerous Foreign Affairs ministers
Mr Bourlanges ' report will contribute significantly to this
In fact , we get the feeling that this is less a report than the framework for a Bourlanges Constitution
We voted in favour of the report because a point of fundamental importance to us was otherwise being voted away
That is unacceptable because this veto is one of the constitutional cornerstones of the EU
The Convention 's democratic representativeness in such a case cannot be seen to be greater than that of the governments
Codecision must not lead to a shift in current procedure whereby the material content of agreements is examined , something that would not be the role of the legislative authority
The report contains sound proposals for new terminology aimed at clarifying the ways in which the EU 's legal instruments work and at making the decision-making process more easily accessible
The report makes it clear that the EU can only act in areas delegated by the Member States
An obligation on the part of future intergovernmental conferences to comply with the Convention would fundamentally alter the relationship between the EU and the Member States
The requirement of unanimity in the case of treaty changes must be maintained
The ratification processes must be respected and continue to operate as they do at present
The funding of the EU must be decided upon unanimously
The Moder@@ ates are opposed to proposals that may lead to the EU 's being funded by EU taxes
Taking Europe further along its current path , this method would distance the Member States from the European decision-making process
As many successive constitutional changes are made , an increasing number of Member States could be reduced to the status of v@@ ass@@ al states
We can imagine the result in terms of adhe@@ sion to the Community project '
In the end , the adopted resolution contained a more vague passage on this point , but the intent remains
The chaos he criticises is not just in the texts , however , but also in reality
In wanting to reconcile European unification with competing capitalist interests , the report is reduced to squaring the circle
It consequently advocates extending the use of qualified majority voting in the Council with the communitarisation of a greater number of policies
They have emerged over the course of fifty years via treaties , ordin@@ ances and directives , with the Court of Justice having to act as arbit@@ er
It is unclear to the citizens of Europe who is responsible for those rules , how far-reaching they are and how they can be changed
The word ' directive ' creates the impression that these are non-binding recommendations , hence well-meaning advice
I do not support his intentions , but I do support his clarity
He quite rightly wants executive measures of the European Commission to be submitted for the approval of this Parliament if we register an objection within three months
As with any exercise of this kind , institutional mim@@ ic@@ ry does , however , have its limits
Is it really appropriate to attempt to transpose to Community level the constitutional model that is common to the Member States ?
The answer is clearly ' No '
I broadly share the legal assessment this report makes of the Community legal system
The current framework ignores any principle for design@@ ating legal acts and is based on terms that are frequently obscure and sometimes misleading
The fact is that giving the Community legal system coherence and clarity by no means requires imposing a federal legislative framework and this is something we all know
Mr President , last week , I was on an official visit to Greece with a Parliamentary committee
V@@ ote , therefore , for the least possible aid to be given to this type of treatment of agricultural produce
We are only voting for this report because it advocates prudence , which we consider beneficial to consumers
The real problem does not arise from the ion@@ isation process itself as much as from the use to which it is put
Although it can already be applied to the benefit of producers and consumers ( conservation of foods , eradication of parasites , etc
) , the agri-@@ food and mass marketing sectors , concerned solely with increasing their profits , can turn the process against users
The final report is to be welcomed because it upholds the current restrictive list of products
It should be remembered that the precautionary principle must always be observed
Mr President , British Labour Members voted against the report because our amendments to remove errors of fact were not carried
These errors remain in paragraphs 15 , 22 , 25 , 26 , 30 , 31 , 32 and 33
I prefer to vote for fact and not fiction and , because certain people wish to obscure the truth with political fiction , I have voted against
It has been claimed that over 10 million animals were slaughtered during the foot and mouth outbreak but owners have only claimed compensation for 6
Farmers , I know , are not slow in coming forward
There is no evidence of breaches in animal welfare legislation
If there was , surely there would have been prosecutions , since animal rights groups within the UK are amongst the most active in the world
The Environmental Agency within the UK carried out an investigation of the procedure used in the foot and mouth outbreak and concluded that there had been no breaches
The report is , therefore , unfortunately basically flawed
This report , when he looks ahead , is an excellent report and provides useful guidelines for future action
We strongly reject the questions about the legality of the cul@@ ls because the courts in the United Kingdom upheld their legality
We strongly reject the idea of breaches of animal welfare legislation because there have been no prosecutions as a result of investigations of those claims
We strongly reject the claims concerning breaches of environmental legislation because the Environmental Agency has conducted its assessment and come to the conclusion that there was no environmental harm
We reject the claim of bio@@ security lapses because there was no evidence of the spread of infection from carcasses being moved or by official personnel
We reject the figure of 10 million animals slaughtered because farmers have only claimed for 6
5 million and this is a fantasy figure being used for political gain
I want to congratulate the rapporteur and the members of the Temporary Committee on Fo@@ ot and M@@ outh Dis@@ ease on the excellent work they have done together
This is an important report because it endorses some firm points of reference in the problematic area of the prevention of this terrible disease
Secondly in that the report urges the European Union to change its current policy of vaccination being a last resort
The Community should be able to play a fundamental role in defining the strategy for controlling foot and mouth disease
Indeed , we support the call for a shift of emphasis in European Union policy away from purely commercial considerations
The foot and mouth epidemic that affected Europe in 2001 was a great disaster , and not only for the United Kingdom , where mass slaughter of livestock was necessary
Quite apart from the tragic consequences for farmers , the effects of this catastrophe and the urgent sanitary measures implemented have reached far beyond the agriculture sector
We therefore abstained from voting on this report , although we do support some of its recommendations
There is no doubt that the committee 's report underlines the scale of what was the world 's worst ever foot and mouth outbreak
It has to be remembered that on the day the alarm was first raised the disease had already taken hold in over 50 farms in 16 different counties
I understand the havoc it wrea@@ ked for so many individuals and communities in North Yorkshire and elsewhere
I have joined with my British Labour colleagues in the PSE Group in voting against this report
As President of the European Parliament 's All Party Intergroup on the Welfare and Conservation of Animals , I naturally have a special interest in the Kreissl-Dörfler report
I support measures to prevent a similar outbreak of foot and mouth disease , as proposed in the report
I reject claims regarding the legality of the cull
Whilst very regrettable , the cull was perceived at the time as the most effective measure to end the outbreak
It is very easy to be wise in hindsight
The approach of the UK Government with respect to the cul@@ ls was approved by the European Commission
Any report such as this requires accurate information
As , for example , the statistics quoted appear to be contrary to official UK figures , it brings into question the wider points of the report
For this reason , and with reservations as above , I have voted against the report
We must , however , stress the connection between outbreaks of animal diseases , such as BSE , foot and mouth etc
Inspection services should also be strengthened , especially in the most isolated rural areas , and ' blind ' cul@@ ls or slaughter should be avoided
Overall , I am happy with the text adopted
These early warning systems , once set up by the Commission , should benefit visibly from monitoring and increased control of their operation
Information on the risks and appropriate measures must be distributed and included
Failure to do so will incur penalties which are in proportion with the breaches observed
International trade , however , is also a factor that should be taken into account
Today , this meat that could carry a risk of foot and mouth disease can be taken to these ware@@ houses within the Union itself
I had hoped this issue would be treated as more important than one subject to cheap political point-@@ scoring
In these circumstances , I am recording my opposition to the final vote
My support remains for the original recommendations which will guide our future legislation , and ensure Europe plays a constructive role in tackling foot and mouth disease for the future
My constituents expect no less
As a Member of the European Parliamentary Labour Party I will vote against this report
Though the report contains some useful suggestions for the avoidance of future outbreaks of FMD , it is seriously flawed in a number of important respects
It also , for example , states that 10 million animals were killed when farmers claimed for only 6
The report is so flawed that it cannot be supported
However , there are some aspects in the report which need clarifying
Firstly , the cul@@ ls were carried out in accordance with legal provisions and in full consultation with the European Commission
Secondly , the number of animals slaughtered should reflect farmers ' claims for 6
Thirdly , there have been no prosecutions for breaches of animal welfare legislation nor was any environmental harm identified by the Environmental Agency
Fourthly , there was no evidence of a spread of infection from carcasses during transport or by personnel
Mr Kreissl-Dörfler 's report provides important guidelines should future legislation be required to tackle a new outbreak , were it to occur anywhere across the European Union
Given that farmers have claimed for 6
5 million animals , I also reject the claim that 10 million were killed during the outbreak
Despite the many positive aspects of the report , I will vote against in the light of the above comments
The south east of England was one of the regions first hit by the foot and mouth outbreak in the UK
As such , this report outlines many of the measures necessary to prevent such an outbreak occurring on the same scale in the future
However , there were many discrepancies introduced by politically motivated amendments which distorted the report;
No prosecutions of any complaints occurred
Investig@@ ations proved no such lapses occurred
The cul@@ ls were pronounced illegal
The courts found in favour of government action with regard to the con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous cull
It was deemed a measure that was necessary to stem the spread of the disease
The European Commission was informed at all times
The Environment Agency looked into matter and found no environmental harm ,
No control on imported products , however , could ever be as comprehensive , precise and rigorous as those applied by Member States and professional bodies themselves
Controls on imports will never provide the same safety guarantees as regular controls and traceability applied to national production and localised production in Europe
This should further encourage us to apply Community preference effectively and keep as much of our agricultural production as possible within the European Union
That concludes the explanations of vote
( The sitting was suspended at 12
and resumed - at 3 p
The Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed
Mr President , item 11 of yesterday 's Minutes refers to a speech I made under Rule 1@@ 21 of the Rules of Procedure
This train has been withdrawn by a unilateral decision
Is there a follow-up to this type of request ?
I would also like to know what happened to the speech I made yesterday , for I would like a written summary to be included in tomorrow 's publication
You are repeating a request , and there is another procedure in our Rules of Procedure for obtaining this information
Mr Färm will open the debate in his capacity as general rapporteur
Mr President , the annual budgetary procedure has passed off unusually smoothly
He has helped guide the members of the Council to a very constructive settlement
When this process began just over a year ago , one of my objectives was to develop Parliament 's own procedures , and I think we have made some progress
We have established a dialogue concerning objectives and guidelines at an early stage
We have worked closely with the other specialised committees in order to get them actively involved in the budgetary process
We have developed the new budgetary debate in September , something which it will certainly be possible to develop further next year
These are things that have worked well
Unfortunately , I also have to sound a critical note , not about our work on the budget but about the EU 's budgetary system
In my opinion , the problem is the long-term budget plan and the interinstitutional agreement that set sector-@@ by-@@ sector budget ceilings for seven years in a row
That is an entirely unreasonable model
Such long-term and detailed planning is not possible in a modern budgetary system
It is reminiscent , rather , of the Soviet Union
Certainly , I accept budgetary discipline
I am a keen adhe@@ rent of budget ceilings , but that model is far too rigid
As long as we are governed by it , we shall all constantly be looking for ways of escaping from the straitjacket of the financial perspective
Since the advent of the budget plan in 1999 , we have used the flexibility mechanism each year to a greater or lesser extent
We have also developed new , ever more creative methods of achieving flexibility
We have an emergency reserve of which we make ever more extensive use
We have added the new solidarity fund , which is also a flexibility instrument
This creativity has been of great help , but it is not especially open or transparent
There is no sound long-term budgetary methodology
In spite of these deficiencies , I think we have a lot to be satisfied with
Allow me to mention just a few of the most important areas including , of course , enlargement
I am certain that my fellow MEP , Mr Stenmarck , will talk more about this as it relates to the budgets for Parliament and the other institutions
Enlargement has , however , also made its mark on other areas
The major new resources in terms of information will have bearing upon enlargement
A range of different bodies receiving aid from the EU are now investing those resources in integrating the new countries
We are concerned here with the social dialogue , youth cooperation , the combined fight against crime etc
Allow me also to mention the EU 's efforts in the fight against poverty and disease in the developing countries
I know that there is some criticism of the fact that we have reduced the appropriations to food aid and humanitarian aid
That has been done only on condition that we and the Council promise to supply the extra resources that may be required for these purposes next year
We have also been criticised for the way in which we deal with the EU 's contribution to the Global Health Fund
It is criticism that I consider to be unfair
We have prevailed upon the Council to more than double the amount it proposed in its first reading , from EUR 20 million to EUR 42 million
We have also got the Council to promise to try to produce a corresponding sum from the European Development Fund
More than that I do not in actual fact think it is reasonable to demand
Ladies and gentlemen , this budget will not be an historic one because of any dramatic conflicts or major new revolutionary budget initiatives
It will , however , be historic because it is the last budget with the old budgetary terminology
Next year , we shall all be forced to teach ourselves activity-based budgeting
It will also be historic because it is the last budget relating to an EU with 15 Member States
That , I believe , is the greatest success of this year
We began the year with significant anticipated deficits for the 2003 budget
By various stages , these were subsequently reduced , giving us a manageable surplus and what I deem to be a wholly acceptable margin for the next budgetary year
Within this budget , we have also managed to implement those priorities we set as early as when the guidelines were drawn up at the beginning of the year
The obvious top priority of all at that time was enlargement
If the agreement is signed in March , we shall be able to have 147 observers from all these countries in place by no later than April
The necessary decisions will have been taken and implemented by then
What we have also been concerned with is giving each institution the opportunity to complete its preparations for enlargement
This issue acqui@@ res further significance when we now consider the fortunate decision from Copenhagen
The second priority was to implement necessary reforms
These were necessary with or without enlargement , especially for the European Parliament
The main concern was with those key areas on which every parliament , be it national or European , must stand firm
Parliament 's legislative function must also be strengthened
In a very short time , Parliament has been given significant legislative power , meaning that the basic conditions under which Parliament operates within this area must also be strengthened
These are key areas for the European Parliament , and it is precisely in these areas that we must stand especially firm
The third priority is to tackle all this successfully
It means that we are now entering a new budget year with a fairly broad margin which will hopefully amount to slightly more than EUR 20 million
Allow me to point out that I am conscious of the fact that the Council wishes to see a still greater margin
I fully understand why that is so , and I promised at a conciliation to see what I could do to bring about a still greater margin
I subsequently went through the whole budget again , and we have now got this far but , unfortunately , no far@@ ther
Allow me to conclude by observing that this is the last budget the European Parliament will adopt before enlargement to include ten new Member States
It has been important to implement all this in a way that means that the preparations for enlargement can be made in all the institutions
In my judgment , this is possible
It has also been important to make a number of decisions during the year to cope with long-term problems in category 5
It is my judgment that we have done this , moreover , but it is important for this work to be followed up
Further decisions along these lines will be necessary during the forthcoming budget year
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the EU 's budget for 2003 is indeed a presen@@ table one
This fru@@ gal and forward-looking budget has resulted from good cooperation such as one can only dream of - with Parliament , and with the rapporteurs
I can do no other than express my utmost appreciation to Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck
I am , naturally , also grateful to the Council
69 billion , which can be used in entering into new commitments on the EU 's behalf
That adds up to an increase of only 0
I would like to see anyone else do the same
5 billion have been allocated to payments for the coming year , representing an increase of 1
Ex@@ pressed as a percentage of the EU 's gross domestic product , only 1
02 % is being spent on the EU Budget for 2003 - the lowest it has been for ten years
The financial planning voted in 1999 provided EUR 103 billion for 2003 , that being EUR 5 billion more than the 2003 Budget has now actually required
It is now a matter of certainty , ladies and gentlemen , that the 2003 Budget will be the last EU Budget for an EU of 15 Member States
Copenhagen really has now sent out the message that it is time for all the EU 's institutions to roll their sleeves up
Now is the time to reach all the interinstitutional agreements , so that our institutions can make these changes effectively
Of the new posts , 2@@ 36 will be allocated to the Council for the purpose of this preparation , whilst 500 will be allocated to the Commission
On the Commission 's behalf , I want to thank the budgetary authority for this decision
All of these are areas in which it is clear that the acquis must be applied from day one , and preparations must be made for this
These are large sums of money , and their implementation must of course be well prepared
Parliament and the Council have welcomed the further policy priorities for the 2003 Budget , which are ' stability and security ' and ' sustainable and inclusive economic development '
The budget for DG Research and the Joint Research Centre totals EUR 3 billion for 2003 , which underlines the importance of sustainable and inclusive economic development
The EU Budget will , in the coming year , bear the joint costs of the Police Mission in Bosnia
This is an important step towards a common foreign and security policy
We are continuing to stand by our promises and by the policy commitments we have made in the Balkan region
In these areas , Europe is indeed the largest donor
In future , it will be funded to the tune of EUR 1 billion every year , and that includes 2003
As a whole , the balance sheet for work on budget policy in 2002 is an extremely favourable one
A completely new Financial Regulation covers the EU 's Budget , as also the European Development Fund and the other facilities
Today , the Commission adopted in its entirety the rules for implementing this Financial Regulation
As I have already emphasised , the 2003 Budget is the last for an EU of 15 Member States
We now have to adapt the Financial Perspective to the Copenhagen conclusions , in order to draw up the 2004 Budget for an EU of 25 Member States
Pre-accession aid for Bulgaria and Romania is then to be replen@@ ished , and the budget for pre-accession aid is then to include Turkey
That is what the Copenhagen Council decided
So it is that the budget reflects the dynamics of European development
I believe that to be deserving of particular mention
Hon@@ esty demands that we say that
What helps to finance next year 's low level of increase is the fact that we are transferring funds from the 2002 Budget that were used either wrongly or ir@@ regularly
We in the PPE-DE Group would like to expressly call upon the Commission not to let up in the area of its own reform
The dialogue procedure that we have agreed on with the Council builds a bridge leading to greater democracy in the definition of Europe 's foreign policy objectives
Commissioner Schreyer referred to the rate of increase in the budget 's commitments , which stands at 0
Our budget does not show the rates of increase - let alone the rates of inflation - that were provided for in Berlin
In Berlin , the precaution was taken of creating a margin in order to make enlargement possible and easier
26 % increase , our present budgetary conduct brings us another step closer to that
Take a look at payments , and the figure of 1
9 % does not , at first sight , appear to be very much
It is substantially less than what would be needed to reduce the debts that are still outstanding
9 % is more than what is currently available to many national Finance Ministers to draw up their own budgets
9 % , because it is important
We have to consider this budget , and what it covers , as a whole
We have a budget of less than EUR 100 billion
That is 25 % less than what the fifteen States of the European Union spend on defence
Agriculture is wholly euro@@ pe@@ anised , and preparations are being made for youth exchange activities
We are preparing for enlargement , we have a common foreign and security policy , and we collaborate on justice and home affairs
We respond to the ageing of society in the European Union
Our own financial planning still needs to take this more into account
I have already made repeated reference to pensions , but we want in future to respond to the ageing of European society as a whole
One very major priority has been and still is category IV
I read a newspaper report today , which stated that the European Parliament did not regard the fight against Aids as important
Let me point out now that Parliament has quadrupled the sum of money originally proposed to be allocated for this purpose
Anyone who claims that we do not attach enough importance to this has no idea what he is talking about
I would like again to emphatically underline the great progress that this year 's budget procedure has enabled us to make
I can follow on seam@@ lessly from where Mr Ferber left off
These are matters that will have to be resolved in the Convention , that really need to be organised elsewhere
Mrs Schreyer , you have already acted as if all of this were already in the bag
Although our attitude is very positive , your dogmatic ' and so it was decided ' is something I cannot leave unchallenged
That can only be said when discussions have gone well and been concluded
I also want to thank Denmark 's chairmen in the Council for their cooperation , which was excellent , and Commissioner Mic@@ ha@@ e@@ le Schreyer for her excellent input
Next year 's European Union budget is a disciplined budget
The increase in expenditure is below inflation , at just 1
This represents an outstanding gesture of support by the European Parliament to help Member States balance their national budgets
It also demonstrates responsibility on the part of the EU , while Member States try to meet the requirements of its Stability and Growth Pact
At present these stand at EUR 103 billion , which is to say , more than the entire budget for one year
There has been an increase in arrears of EUR 17 billion since the start of the year , with no limit to this in sight
The situation is at its most wretched in the area of structural operations , where outstanding commitments have grown over the year by EUR 13 billion
The most difficult situation , relatively speaking , however , is in the area of pre-accession aid , where EUR 8
5 billion in outstanding commitments has ac@@ cru@@ ed in three years , with just under EUR 2 billion being paid out in actual aid
What is most vex@@ ing is that there would have been funds available for payment in respect of these commitments , but they were not used
Consequently , the situation betrays administrative inefficiency , with the Commission and the Member States as the guilty parties
That is why Commission reform is extremely important
At the moment the Commission is very conservative and shir@@ ks its responsibilities
We should also simplify legal instruments and procedures , as was agreed in conciliation with the Council in the summer
Enlargement is the hallmark of next year 's budget
This budget is the last to be drafted for an EU consisting of 15 Member States
Parliament safeguarded the posts needed in the Commission for enlargement by am@@ assing resources partly out of this year 's budget
In this way we were able to meet next year 's expenditure in advance and fit administrative expenditure into the tight framework in place for heading 5
My group supports this
Otherwise , we could say of the budget 's content that the EU 's functions are adequately financed
Agricultural expenditure is under control , so there is no need for significant reforms for budgetary reasons
External actions were able to be partly financed in advance out of this year 's budget , and there was no need to look again at Parliament 's priorities
In addition to other actions , we were able to improve the financing of the Northern Dimension a little , which has to be considered a good thing
Mr President , the grand total for next year 's budget compared to Member States ' GNP is a record low
Our group is worried about the low level of payment appropriations
It is feared that , on account of a new rule , a ' sunset clause ' , Member States will lose the payments they are due
If next year payment appropriations do not meet payment needs , the sunset clause will cause a new kind of problem
Our group would like to focus on the interinstitutional agreement the previous Parliament made on our behalf
New needs have come into being , especially under headings 3 and 4 , which cannot be covered by the current maximum amounts
The share of responsibility would seem to be one where the USA does the attacking and the EU pays for the clean-up operation and reconstruction in the aftermath of war
A new Iraq war might increase the pressure on next year 's foreign aid programme , so there are no margins under that heading for initiating new actions
In the opinion of our group the ceilings in the interinstitutional agreement should be re-@@ estimated
Let us please make this stupid Stability and Growth Pact more flexible
The budget has a special flexible instrument , but it would appear that the Council mis@@ uses it for payments that can be predicted instead
The failure of the Moroccan fishing agreement was not an un@@ foreseeable piece of expenditure for which the flexible instrument was really needed
The break@@ ing-up of the Spanish and Portuguese fishing fleets should have been totally financed next year in some way other than partially by means of the flexible instrument
next time it will perhaps be war
For the sake of balance , I should like to mention a number of positive and a number of negative points , but I shall begin with the negative ones
For me , these are the payments , and I fully support what Mr Virrankoski has said about them
During the arbitration process , Parliament agreed to the reduction of the budgeted payments
This dimin@@ ishes the credibility of the institutions , but perhaps the Council or the Member States feel they cannot agon@@ ise too much about this
Another problem I have relates to the reduction in loans for food and humanitarian aid by EUR 55 million
Of course I am aware that those in favour say that this is just a simple accounting device and that the total numbers remain the same
The funds remain the same , but the number of people requiring money from the budget line is increasing
my group is very pleased about the freezing of the funds of KEDO
We have always found it regrettable that we have never opted for a lasting solution to the North-@@ Korean energy question , namely investment in energy-efficient and renewable sources of energy
Thanks to the European Union , about a thousand North Koreans are being trained in modern nuclear technology
Now it emerges that North Korea is not keeping to its part of the agreements and is after all investing in its own nuclear weapons programme
That is why we must now once again re-examine KEDO carefully , and as we see it wind it up
We can easily find an alternative use for that twenty million
surely that must be seen as an important achievement in this set of budgetary negotiations
Through yet another odd accounting operation we have created scope in next year 's budget for five hundred new posts in the Commission
And that is good news
Therefore they might wish to re-examine this , since we have after all agreed collectively that the European Union has three priorities , one of which is sustainable development
Hence , it would make very good sense if a substantial number of those five hundred posts were to go to strengthening DG Environment
My final point , Mr President , concerns the animal experimentation centre at Ri@@ j@@ swi@@ jk
I can already hear honourable Members sigh@@ ing that this story has dragged on and on , but it is now on the point of resolution
We must apply clear , ethical preconditions to the experiments on mon@@ keys that are carried out there
If there is an alternative available or the tests are not objectively necessary , the European Union should no longer subsidise these tests
In any case , an end should be put to tests on hom@@ in@@ ids
They are ethically unacceptable and I hope I can count on your support
The 2003 budget has not been a simple budget , nor has it been easy in political terms
Nor can the - albeit significant - results achieved in conciliation in November lead to any lasting change in the situation
That , however , does not change the fact that the Heading 4 ceiling is still too low , not to say sti@@ fl@@ ingly low
What will we do when the Council asks us to authorise it to make a financial commitment because of new international political developments ?
Now , for example , we have to find funds for the problems in Galicia
What would we have done , for example , in the case of Afghanistan ?
What would we have done in the case of the Balkans ?
Not to mention Heading 3
Indeed , the European Union 's commitments increase every year in the field of internal policy too
With every passing year , there are new , costly multiannual programmes of huge political import which , as such , must be processed and adhered to
What , however , will we do when there is no longer a margin for any political initiative that Parliament might want to set in motion ?
And that is just to mention two headings
With thri@@ ft and hard work you can build a palace
This ancient Dutch proverb is only partly applicable to the European Union budget for 2003 , which will be set this week
I have no criticism to make of the hard work
The well thought-out result of the joint efforts of the Commission , the Council and this Parliament is commendable
Time and again , an important question is overlooked , however
Na@@ mely the question of the effectiveness of the many lines where there are payment problems
We are convinced that the Commission is biting off much more than it can chew , actively encouraged by Parliament
Surely that must give us pause for thought
We are therefore gratified that in this case a start has at any rate been made on the reduction of set allocations and payments relating to structural measures
The high level of arrears , particularly in the field of the structural funds , must lead to a thorough prun@@ ing of unprofitable budget lines
That would be a real contribution to a more credible European Union financial policy
In other policy fields , too , a substantial prun@@ ing of budget lines would be welcome , however
Particularly in the field of external operations many lines could be scrapped
Only if the European Union has added value in the foreign policy field is an operation worth considering
What , for example , is one to make of Amendment No 139 to line B7-6@@ 000 ?
It argues for an earmarking of no less than EUR 20 million for autonomous and independent foundations in the European Union
In the justification , there is the co@@ y remark that political foundations are ideally qualified for the activities mentioned
But in that case what do concepts like independence and autonomy mean ?
After a previous discussion on embryos in the research framework programme , I must again broach an ethical question
This time it relates to abortion in the context of a programme for the promotion of sexual and so-called reproductive health and rights in developing countries
O@@ fficially the European Commission says that abortion cannot be financed as a method of family planning
abortion is being co-financed
I therefore appeal to you to decisively reject Amendment No 147
This matter shows yet again that the financing of ethically controversial activities leads to problems
The European Commission should exercise more restraint in such questions
In addition , the way in which the EU 's development policy complements that of the Member States is put into a new perspective
Comple@@ mentarity in this form leaves a nasty taste in my mouth
I am interested to hear the arguments of the European Commission justifying its indirect involvement in abortion
Mr President , let us be thrifty , following the trust placed in us by our citizens , and apply thri@@ ft as well as hard work
After all , the citizen foo@@ ts the bill
Instead , for at least two financial years , this line has been financed with no legal basis
We were then told that there had actually been an evaluation
I succeeded , with some difficulty , in un@@ ear@@ thing it
President Prodi himself had taken upon himself the responsibility of ascertain@@ ing what the United Nations recognised
Mr President , like other speakers this afternoon , I welcome the successful conclusion of this budget process
It is certainly one of the most peaceful that I have known and my congratulations on the excellent work done by our two rapporteurs
There are in any budget process successes and failures
We in our political group , as Mr Ferber has indicated , feel we have had more successes than failures in this budget process
Three issues stand out , and I would like to mention them
To that effect , we suggested the appropriations for staff should be put in the reserve
As a result , we are now promised a document for the PDB 2004 setting out how we are going to eliminate abnormal outstanding commitments by the end of 2003
I think that we have some way to go , but this is a step in the right direction
For that purpose , we withheld money in the reserve at first reading , so that we could have a proper negotiation with the Council on second reading
We also have put funds into the budget so that the Commission can come forward with a study establishing CFSP priorities over the next five years
I very much hope that this study will be completed
Last and not least is the question of successful implementation of the Commission reforms
For my group , this is an essential point
Therefore , I think that on these three items , the 2003 budget has been a success
We had a strategy and we had some muscle enabling us to achieve that , by withholding monies or posts so that action could be taken
But it is thanks to Parliament 's powers and the determination of our political group to use them that we have made progress on those three items so far
A former chairman of the Committee on Budgets and a former general rapporteur went on a ski@@ ing holiday
they fell down a deep ra@@ vine
Twenty-@@ four hours later , people realised they were missing and they sent out a search party
When the search party reached the ra@@ vine , it looked down and saw these two figures
' Are you from the Budgets Committee ? '
' We are from the Red Cross
' We have no money '
That is the image that most people have of the Committee on Budgets
However , with this budget we have been extremely kind to virtually everybody who has come along
We have a budget which reflects considerable good will on the part of this Parliament
It must be said that there have been a good deal of fir@@ sts in this budgetary process , not least because of the attitude of the Danish Presidency
We have all congratulated them , and they have worked exceptionally hard to ensure that we finally have a budget of which we can all be proud
There is normally considerable lobbying at this final stage , but not on this occasion
The very few instances of lobbying we have encountered concern one or two lines relating to category 4
Our negotiations in the conciliation with the Council and the Commission have actually proved fruitful
From that point of view , it is quite good
Mr Ferber urged the Commission and the Council to ensure that the money is well spent
It is our job as well , and the committees in this Parliament have to ensure that they are monitoring month in and month out
The Member States are happy about that , but it is not good budgetary practice
Mr President , I too want to join in the delight that has been expressed today in many quarters concerning the constructive way in which the budgetary negotiations have proceeded
It will be easier for all of us to see the economic and political priorities in the budget
Without exceeding the agreed financial framework , EU legislation must be translated into the languages of the new Member States , and staff from the new countries must be appointed
I think that Parliament has made its contribution to that process
It is important , indeed it is in everyone 's interest , that there should be no rec@@ esses of the budget outside parliamentary control
Rev@@ ising the financial perspectives would therefore be the most appropriate course of action
This com@@ pression of funds is now being extended to food aid , to cooperation with Latin America , the Balkans and to the MEDA Programme
Nevertheless , as a result of all the advances , transfers , reserves and non-@@ execution , not even the budgetary decisions adopted have been implemented
This is the case now of the EUR 55 million intended specifically for Afghanistan
All of this is happening because the principle of sufficiency of means , according to which new priorities should be given new financial means , is not being observed
A revision of the upper ceiling for the financial perspectives was clearly needed under category 4 , which concerns external policies
9 % , in other words , lower than the expected level of inflation , which will lead to a real reduction in the payments budget
It makes no sense to seek to achieve more and more Europe and at the same time , wish to adopt an increasingly low budget
Having said this , I should like to add a positive note , with regard to East Timor
Mr President , Commissioner , we are not satisfied with the budget as it concerns agriculture
The Brussels conclusions imposed a financial cap that does not exhaust the possibilities offered by Berlin
Mr President , I would like to congratulate the rapporteurs for their work on the EU budget for 2003 which now stands at almost EUR 100 billion
It is recognition by all the key EU institutions of the political importance of assisting farmers , their families and the rural communities in which they live
We must continue to invest in ensuring that we have an economically viable European agricultural system
I am also encouraged by the spin on regional funds in Europe which will amount to EUR 33
98 billion and I am particularly pleased that this is going to be spent in areas like my own region , Con@@ n@@ ach@@ t/@@ Ulster in Ireland
These funds will alleviate the obvious infrastructural deficit that occurs in regions like mine and indeed in other regions that are lagging behind in Europe
Apart from that , you have made us all laugh just the same
We are pleased today because the Färm and Stenmarck reports have brought consensus to this House
They have also brought consensus to our relations with the Council and have responded as far as possible to the Commission 's fair demands
firstly - and other speakers have said this - the real budgetary power of this House is diminishing all the time
When we are not talking about obligatory expenditure , we are talking about multi-annual programmes or privileged expenditure or amending budgets
The percentage of the Community budget not subject to the direct control and decisions of this Parliament increases every year
Within the proposals my group is making to the Convention , those dealing with changing this situation stand out
A representative Parliament must decide on all expenditure
Codecision must be generalised , without thereby jeopardising agricultural and structural spending which must be guaranteed
It is expected that the Union will do increasing numbers of things with fewer resources
And not only is this miracle not eternal , but furthermore it is not sustainable
The answer remains in the air
There are Member States which use , as a variable for their national budgetary adjustments , structural funds which they do not commit and do not implement
I ask myself whether this is the right way to administr@@ ate the European Union , whether this Parliament should agree with this way of acting
Let us hope that the Convention helps us to resolve this problem which we are all facing
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate both rapporteurs , who have attained good results
This means that those budgets which at the outset were EUR 66 million over the ceiling , are now within an acceptable margin
This should help us in the 2004 budget as well
The start of 2003 was a difficult budgetary year
I agree with what Mr Färm said earlier about the straight@@ jacket system within which we have to work
It has been a real juggling act for both rapporteurs , especially on our main budget
I have observed over the last three years a year-@@ on-@@ year crisis situation
Whilst the EU 's obligations and global needs are growing , the finances are not
One of the fundamental problems for Parliament is the lack of influence on the whole of the EU 's budget , particularly category 1
The reality of enlargement is upon us
We have not properly begun to address the full implications of enlargement
Let us just look at the three places of work
In practical terms , that means that there are likely to be 2 000 to 3 000 more people around once a month in this city
Even now the hotels are struggling to cope
Comb@@ ined with this the transport links - especially the air links - are far from satisfactory for current Members
Therefore it is absolutely essential that the Convention gras@@ ps the nettle and looks seriously at the three places of work
It is important that the Council and the Convention recognise that they have to take this political decision
Mr President , it has already been said by many people in many different keys , this year 's budget procedure was exemplary
There was very efficient cooperation between all the components of the budgetary authority
My compliments also to the two rapporteurs and the chairman of the budgetary committee , who proved a safe pair of hands
We had , I think , the greatest difficulty in He@@ ad@@ ings 4 and 5
I believe that a good solution has been found for both categories
This morning we talked in this House about the foot and mouth crisis of 2001
The resolution adopted this morning again urged the undertaking of research in various fields
As regards last year 's budget , the Commission had had every opportunity
Because even before the committee was called into being , Parliament had already voted in favour of initiating research
I also said in the first reading in October that the Commission should carry out research in two areas , marker vaccines and insurance systems
As far as I am aware , the decision of the budgetary authority has up to now been set aside and the Commission has still not begun signing contracts
I should like to underline yet again how deeply I regret this
Last week we had Copenhagen
Of course there was a huge amount of talk about money
we already have programmes in place for Eastern Europe which should be being implemented at this very moment , but implementation is extremely slow
I believe that the Commission must pay particular attention to that
Mr President , it gives me great pleasure to say that the budget for 2003 has gone wonderfully well
It was a privilege to be in on the mid-term and end-of-@@ year conciliation meetings where there was constructive and sensible debate and deals were done
I would like to praise Commissioner Kinnock for his reforms at the Commission , although there has been one blind spot
I am delighted to see Mrs Schreyer here today , who hopefully is going to talk about accounting control
During the passage of this budget we in the Conservatives and the European People 's Party tried to indicate that we needed better and tighter accounting control
If we did not get that , we would not release certain amounts of money and allow certain staffing levels
There needs to be a seamless thread , and I am delighted that Mrs Schreyer is here to address that issue today
I praise the fact that we get good value from the European Union budget
We have brought down the percentage of gross domestic product spent on the budget successfully , so that it is now just over 1 % at 1
I praise everyone involved , particularly the rapporteurs , on a very successful budget outcome
Mr President , I will restrict my brief comments to fisheries
Of course , my group is going to support this agreement at second reading
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in 2003 the current period of the financial perspectives will reach its half-way point
This is the first budgetary procedure which deals successfully with the consequences of enlargement in terms of administrative spending
In my view , this is a good departure point for dealing with future difficulties
It goes without saying , therefore , that I warmly congratulate the rapporteurs , Mr Färm and Mr Stenmarck , and the chairman of our Committee on Budgets
I would like to say sincerely to my colleague Mrs Dührkop Dührkop that we share her objectives , but not the methods or comments we have just heard here
I believe that this is a good example of interinstitutional cooperation
I must also say that once again the revenue for the next financial year will allocate a significant amount through the surpluses of the previous year
This situation , which reveals a chronic under-@@ use of payments in certain areas , must come to an end
I do not want to focus on the content of the budget but to talk about something else
One would have to be blind not to see that we have entered a new phase in European history
Copenhagen is a historic milestone
Those who have believed in enlargement have had to have genuine visionary powers , the visionary powers of Spinelli , Monnet and Schum@@ ann before us
Is it really impossible to be vision@@ aries once again when it comes to the budget too ?
We cannot build a European power with miserly States
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , alongside enlargement and foreign policy , agriculture and structural policy are the essential priorities for the budget
That is only right and proper , as the European Budget was originally agricultural in character
That has to be borne in mind when considering large areas of the Council 's policy
There is something dubious about constantly burdening the European Budget with new Community tasks without stating where the money for these tasks is to come from
As I understand these things , it certainly is not going to be from the agriculture budget
I do not see that it has to be our function to keep national budgets sound by dividing up the work in this way
To that extent , it follows that the amendments taken up by the Council from Parliament 's first reading are double-@@ edged
On the one hand , I am glad that the Council has withdrawn 25 % of the across-the-board cuts in the lines under heading 1@@ A
This money is not being used where it is needed - as aid that actually generates income
Money has been taken away even from the strengthening of the second pillar that has been called for on all sides
It is important for me to again emphasise , in conclusion , that the agriculture budget faces attack on two fronts
Both of these things I regard as unfair and would like to take this opportunity to make this abundantly clear
I believe , as has been so often repeated , that we can indeed be truly satisfied with this budget
Nevertheless now that I have heard everyone in this long debate , I wonder if what we are experiencing today is not the quiet before the storm
This time it has all gone well , we all got through it satisfactorily , but we have put things off till the future
How will things go next year ?
How can this budget continue in the long term to fulfil the function it fulfils at present if it is talked about in such over@@ blown terms ?
If one listens to the individual Finance Ministers , it seems as if the major part of their problems resides in this European budget
Yet everyone wonders why so much is spent , although from a national perspective relatively little money is involved
People are reluctant to look closely at these
So I think that we must bear this in mind
So you can easily see that a collective approach to such a policy can solve many more problems than doing it all separately
I believe that recently such noises are heard too infrequently
Everyone is surely too preoccupied with the relatively small amount
We can survive it , we have laid the right foundations , but we must be certain that we can see it through
We now appeal to the Convention to enshrine this accordingly in the nascent European constitution and to beef it up
The first is external trade
The next round of WTO talks is imminent
Secondly , the WTO is in urgent need of a parliamentary assembly to accompany it
We can observe how pressure on the part of NGOs is constantly increasing , and how a political debate on globalisation issues is becoming ever more important
Thirdly , we in this House must ourselves step up our efforts in order to meet the challenges involved in preparing the WTO to face the future
At the end of the day , this issue will decisively affect some 20 % of jobs in the European Union
On the subject of industry , I want to record the fact that support for border regions has been very successful , especially that given to small and medium-sized enterprises
The B5-@@ 5@@ 10 budget line would also be very well suited to increasing the budget for the ' Ar@@ ge 28 ' working community of chambers of commerce
I think it very sensible that discussions have touched on this
A further factor is that consideration is given , in the fourth multiannual programme , to the various modes of financing Basle II
I believe these programmes to be of great importance for the future
My fourth and final point has to do with intelligent energy
I would like to pick up on what Mr Walter said in his intervention with reference to the adjustment of the Financial Perspective in the course of enlargement
Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf , who is no longer in the Chamber , raised the subject of Parliament 's decisions on expenditure in the area of agricultural policy
It is my belief that this particular budget procedure has again shown that the European Budget cannot but stand to gain by this
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken on Thursday , at 11
( The sitting was suspended at 4
and resumed at 5 p
The next item is the Commission communications on the future of pension systems and the modernisation of accounting
Mr President , today , the Commission has adopted a comprehensive analysis of the Member States ' strategies for ensuring adequate and sustainable pensions
Moreover , the financial sustainability of pensions depends very much on the success of the European employment strategy
The agreement on applying the open method of coordination to the issue of pensions was reached at the Laeken European Council one year ago
It is not just the one dimension that we had until now in our European policies , which was within the framework of public finances
It was also agreed that the Member States would submit national strategy reports in which they explain how they achieve those common objectives
The national reports were submitted in September , and the document that has been adopted by the Commission today is an analysis of the national strategies , objective by objective
The Commission 's aim was not to establish a ranking of Member States or to lecture them
The open method of coordination on pensions is not a beauty contest
Member States have to decide for themselves what type of pension systems they want
But our report tried to highlight certain and concrete strengths and weaknesses of national systems and policies
The common objectives can be achieved through a wide range of pension systems
Member States have either flat-rate public pension schemes covering all residents , or ear@@ n@@ ing@@ s-related schemes where benefits are based on employment
They rely to varying degrees on private-@@ funded provision to complement these public schemes
The social partners play a more or less important role in national pension systems
The diversity of pension systems does not prevent us from having shared goals in this important policy area
In general , the national strategy reports described the current state of play rather than presenting new policy initiatives
One important conclusion that we can draw from this exercise is that Member States can cope with ageing societies and avoid a financial or social disaster in their pension systems
The report tries to be neither unduly alarmist , nor too complacent about the situation of pension systems
Indeed , there are a lot of positive developments highlighted in the report , but there are also considerable weaknesses
In many countries , the sound financing of future pension benefits has not been secured
One very effective way of achieving this would be to raise the effective retirement age
Many Member States also have to do more to improve access to occupational pension schemes , particularly for atypical workers , among whom women tend to be over-represented
The portability of occupational pension rights also requires further improvements , and we will be discussing with the social partners at European level how this could be promoted
The European Parliament insisted particularly on the situation of older women
The gender dimension therefore receives much attention in this report
We can expect individual pension rights for women to increase , thanks to increased labour force participation and smaller pay gaps between men and women
However , career breaks still tend to be taken more often by women than by men
However , our priority should be to increase individual pension rights by offering better employment opportunities to women
What is going to happen next with this report ?
The European Council requested a joint report by the Commission and the Council
So the next step will be to examine the Commission 's text in the Council so as to finalise a report in time for the European Council meeting in March
There is no commitment to a second round of national strategy reports and their assessment at European level
However , we are committed to reviewing the common objectives and working methods before 2005 as a basis for deciding on the future of this cooperation
We intend to cooperate with the applicant countries and to carry out the same exercise for their systems
We are also working on common indicators which would allow us to measure the achievements of Member States
However , agreement on common indicators is quite a difficult issue and could not be arrived at in time for this report
We - and I am thinking of countries such as Germany or , in particular , Italy - are laying the foundations for there to be generations of poor pensioners
We will ask for increasingly large contributions to balance our accounts but the size of the pensions they will lead to will steadily decrease
In addition , w e will ask for a super@@ human effort to contribute to supplementary pension schemes
I believe that this report suffers from excessive optimism
I do not feel that we are being alarmist here
I fear that you have placed too much trust in Member States ' forecasts
Mr President , the report is neither optimistic nor pessimistic
There are two objective factors here
The first is the problem of the ageing population and the second is the rise in the entitlement age
I think that we can avoid smaller pensions if we keep to the philosophy I referred to earlier
I very much welcome your remarks , Commissioner
Have those barriers come down yet ?
Secondly , Commissioner , you have said that this is a process of support for the reforms of the Member States
Because not just any reform will be sufficient
Is not , however , attention being drawn to the Swedish model , also endorsed by Poland and Latvia , as a way of ensuring future sustainability ?
Have you taken this factor into account during your deliberations ?
Mr President , in reply to the first question , it is true that certain countries had age limits in the past
So this will be the European framework from July 2003 onwards
As far as the report 's orientation is concerned , I made it quite clear that pension reform policies are national policies
So this is national policy
Secondly , would you please give some thought to whether the term ' raising the retirement age ' is really appropriate ?
We could give more to those who need to improve their standard of living and less to those who have too much , while still spending the same amount
In Italy , for example , there are widows with four children ?
Mr President , I believe the Commissioner has a clear perception of the problems
I have two questions
what in her view is the role of supplementary pensions ?
The second question concerns the effective retirement age and the role of non-discrimination
Of course there is the directive , but as I understood it the greatest problem , namely compulsory retirement at 65 or 60 , is not covered by the directive
Or at least that it has not so far been interpreted in that way
If we cannot solve this , the problem will of course continue to exist
Is it not necessary to modify the directive in that regard ?
How much are they investing in the issue of corporate social responsibility themselves ?
Mr President , in reply to the first question , I agree
May I remind you that one of the basic objectives of the employment strategy is to integrate older people
We can achieve this through specific training proposals and measures and special incentives
This therefore is our approach
We cannot raise the age limit unless we introduce policies at the same time to support the integration of older people
The Member States must therefore say what they have done under each of these lines of approach in the reports they submit
So if there are specific sectors which guarantee adequacy , each Member State must highlight and state what measures it has taken in its reforms
In reply to Mr Pronk 's question on the age of 60 or 65 , there is no directive which sets the retirement age in the Member States
Each Member State sets it on the basis of its economic analysis and capabilities
At present , all the Member States have a lower limit of 65
I would remind you that a recent Commission directive introduced important safety valves for the safe management of these funds
We now move on to the Commission communication on the modernisation of accounting from Mrs Schreyer
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , today the Commission has adopted a financial reform package that marks a crucial stage in this Commission 's reform efforts
This new budgetary law will also make budget execution more transparent and more coherent
Secondly , the Commission has made an overall assessment of the preparedness of its services for the implementation of this new budgetary law
This shows that considerable progress has been made in bringing the old ex ante controls into the services ' internal control procedures
Any remaining problems will receive continued attention and the concerted efforts of all concerned
H@@ ori@@ z@@ on@@ tal services will provide targeted support
The sections of the Commission managing funds will then be fully responsible for budget implementation including the necessary control measures
Finally , the Commission has today also adopted the communication on the modernisation of the Communities ' accounting system
This communication is divided into three parts
First , reform of the book@@ keeping rules; second , adaptation of the supporting information and technology system; and third , the architecture of project management
The Commission had promised the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors to present these measures and the timetable by the end of this year
In so doing , the Commission is taking another important step in the long-term strategy for the modernisation of its accounting system that was begun in the year 2000
In 2000 , the Commission presented a study that led to the Commission proposing that the Financial Regulation should incorporate new book@@ keeping rules using ac@@ cru@@ al accounting
This communication now sets out step by step the action that must be taken to make the modern system available by 2005
In future , book@@ keeping will be done by the double entry system
A new Accounting Standards Committee will be created for the purpose
Various experts from the services as well as from outside will be represented on this committee
The standards in question are in fact very new
This international body adopted its first standard for the public sector in 2000 , the last standard in October 2002
They are therefore quite new rules and we will be using them as a benchmark for our accounting system
When this project is introduced , the European budget will be in the vanguard of accountancy rules
For the new standards to be introduced , the technical support provided by the underlying computer system , that is the information technology , will also have to be modernised
The system currently used for accounting is S@@ in@@ com 2
It was introduced in 1997 and extended to all fund@@ -@@ managing departments in 1999
Experience shows , however , that the future system must be a fully integrated system for book@@ keeping purposes
As you will have inf@@ erred from what I have said , the Commission rejects the first option
A feasibility study will be made of the second and third options , which will be ready in the first half of 2003
A decision will then be taken on the steps that can be taken to develop an integrated system
How will this project be organised , given that it is a large-scale project covering the Commission and all the European Institutions ?
The project organisation puts the chief accountant at the centre of the project
Mr President , I have a couple of questions for the Commissioner
It might be stimulating to hear a couple of remarks concerning this discrepancy
The report also observes that there are serious problems with the system , as we also know of course from the Court of Auditors and from a can@@ ny Mrs Andreasen
The fact that the system cannot talk to itself is also a very great weakness
I should like to hear why there is such considerable disagreement between the Commission and the Court of Auditors
These really are issues we should very much like to hear something about in the Committee on Budgetary Control
It is interesting to hear that you are going to check the receipts of Commission monies - who gets contracts , where tenders go
You are going to change your book@@ keeping rules , your IT systems and your project management
What has the Commission been doing for the last few years ?
Why has it taken so long for this reform to be introduced ?
Finally , who ever signed off the Commission 's accounts in 2001 ?
Mr President , I will now answer Mr Blak 's question
That is an important step , which is now enacted in the Financial Regulation
In the past few years - and this brings me to Mr Heaton-Harris 's question - we have already taken steps towards this capital account
Then , of course , a lot of information about our claims and commitments came from outside the book@@ keeping system
For example , we asked ourselves what the Commission 's future obligations were with regard to pensions for its officials
That was information that was obtained and processed by the Directorate-General for Administration and then fed into the accounting system
This information was not derived from the annual budget
Take another example , which also applies to the Parliament 's budget
Take the fixed assets , this building for example
The budget account contained only the expenditure made in a given year
If you like , the assets were then no longer contained in the accounts , or they had to be brought into them again at an appropriate valuation
For the future we plan - and this is how it is being introduced - that the information will go from the annual budget directly into the capital budget
Then we will know what the European Union 's assets are and we will not have to introduce them separately
I must point out that unfortunately we cannot simply draw on best practices in the Member States
M@@ unicip@@ alities , for example , own infrastructure , and you might therefore say that they have different assets than we do and have to value them differently
That will also be decided by this Standards Committee
If that produces good results , I think that might in future be something that the Member States or third countries will be able to take over from us
there were standards before that time too
How was the Commission able to justify presenting accounts every year even though it knew they were not based on any reliable accounting system ?
how much was invested , financially as well as in other ways , in the internal development of the S@@ I 2 system ?
Commissioner , you call your communication ' Modernisation of Accounting '
To put it politely , I call that a misrepresentation of the facts , as what has been revealed to us in the last few weeks has been total chaos
Your administration is about to blow up in spectacular fashion and if you had the courage of your convictions you would admit it
I seriously wonder how you think you can sell us your new Financial Regulation as a great success when it is not based on an operational book@@ keeping system
That is not usual everywhere in Europe , but I do it
I have a very precise question
You said you wanted to carry out a feasibility study about the IT system
Now we agree that we are under pressure of time so far as the modernisation of the accounting system is concerned
Mr President , Mrs Schreyer , I congratulate you on this ambitious project and have the following questions
The new system must be operational from 2005
What do you propose doing in the meantime , since the Court of Auditors has been voicing strong criticism of the existing book@@ keeping and accounting system since 1994 ?
You know that Parliament will very likely be dealing with these problems once they have been put before the Committee on Budgetary Control
In the past , the Financial Regulation , that is the law that applies to us and also to the other institutions , had only prescribed the cash accounting principle
This met the standard and it was followed
I have pointed out that the further development is a relatively recent development , even for the public sector
Regarding Mrs Stauner 's question , you have again assumed , Mrs Stauner , that the Court of Auditors would not give a statement of assurance for the accounts
You were the rapporteur , the general rapporteur , Mrs Stauner , and you also confirmed this in your statement
That was therefore essential , and we all know that software and computer systems , too , continue to develop
I turn now to Mrs Theato 's question
What will happen in the meantime ?
Work is of course being done all the time
For example , work is now being done to create a central register of accounts and a central register for contracts , which will then be available to all services
We now have the S@@ I@@ -@@ II System for sections managing funds
The data it produces are input into the SAP accounting system , after having been checked by financial control
The managers of resources cannot consult the accounting system direct
They have no access , that is correct , but they cannot consult it either
I would ask Members only to raise points of order , because the other Commissioners and Members need to take part in Question Time
Please cooperate
I notice the Commissioner did not reply to those questions
Mr President , please invite the Commissioner to do so because , as two Members have asked the same question , they are entitled to a full response
Mr President , I will gladly answer the question
As I have explained , in the year 2000 , the Commission commissioned a study that examined the accounting system
We then decided - it was in a Prodi Commission proposal for the Financial Regulation - to propose new book@@ keeping rules
Then in June 2001 the services of the Commission prepared a first package of measures , a first action plan , of what must be done
That was the basis on which the chief accountant was appointed in January 2002 and that was the basis of the work that should have been done
I believe that Parliament itself would say that anyone working in the Commission is responsible for implementation
It is not sufficient to repeat certain criticisms , but it is then that person 's duty to work on implementing the reform
Mr President , on a point of order , I appreciate your comments but this is one of the fundamental problems we have with the Commission at present
Mrs Sandbæk has written to you , Commissioner , asking to see a copy of the signature of your former , former chief accountant on the 2001 accounts
I asked who that person was
I was told in the past that they were signed whilst that person was in post
That person left the Commission 's employment on 31 December 2001
They were either the quickest prepared set of accounts in history or something mag@@ ical happened
I am not convinced by what you have said today and I very much doubt whether the people in the public gallery are convinced
I would just appreciate some frank exchanges and honesty between you and those of us who are interested , because Mrs Andreasen told you what was happening
What happened is a disgrace to you and your institution
Re@@ alis@@ tically , you have to bite the bullet and get on with reforming the accounting system properly , and you could do with Mrs Andreasen 's help
It was sent to the Court of Auditors on time
The Commission presents the budget and capital account to the European Court of Auditors , which also checks the books on an ongoing basis
Ladies and gentlemen , I have no option but to move on to the next item on the agenda
If you need to continue this debate , it must be at another time
The next item is Questions to the Commission
The authors of the questions have naturally been informed
Can the Commission provide information on other projects in this field ?
An expert visit was arranged with a view to assessing needs and subsequently drawing up a timetable of concrete measures to improve the situation
During those visits the Moroccan authorities expressed their political determination and firm commitment to cooperate with the Union in the fight against illegal immigration and on border controls in particular
The content of the programme will subsequently be determined
This programme is the first initiative on border control management with a country in the region
Mr President , the figure the Commissioner has given is EUR 40 million , apparently for the period 2002-@@ 2004
The 40 million is for the years 2002 to 2004
It should also be added that this figure does not represent all the resources available for addressing the problem in general
This is our additional support , including initiatives and inputs that are essential for Morocco to be able to improve its handling of this problem
However , Morocco also implements its own measures
I would also add that this issue concerns more than just money
All such matters are taken up at a mid-term review
It is not just a question of supplying some hardware here and there
Ab@@ use of EU research legislation covering orphan drugs
In 1999 EU legislation was adopted with a view to encouraging research into the development of ' orphan ' drugs for the treatment of rare diseases
Mr President , orphan medicinal products are so called because they are used in the treatment or diagnosis of conditions that occur so rarely
The cost of developing and marketing orphan medicinal products would not be recovered by their expected sales
For this reason , the pharmaceutical industry has been unwilling to develop such products under normal market conditions
The regulation on orphan medicinal products which entered into force in January 2000 provides a system of incentives for sponsors to develop and market designated orphan medicinal products
One of these incentives is market exclusivity for a period of 10 years
This is granted if a designated orphan medicinal product ob@@ tains a marketing authorisation in all Member States
Since 2000 , 123 products have been designated as orphan medicinal products and placed on the Community register
The great majority of these orphan medicinal products contain new innovative ingredients
In a few cases it has been common practice for some time to supply the raw ingredients to treat the patient
However , this chemical has not been tested for its purity and safety and the product is not authorised
Indeed the chemical is not of pharmaceutical quality and may contain unspecified and un@@ quantified impurities
In this situation , it is not surprising that an authorised medicinal product developed to meet rigorous standards of quality , safety and efficacy costs more than the base chemical
The Commission has no powers with respect to either the price or reimbursement of medicines
Mr Posselt , the short answer to your question is no
The longer answer is as follows
I follow very closely the developments of the humanitarian situation in Chechnya and in the neighbouring republics where part of the Chechen population is displaced
As you know , ECHO is the main donor of humanitarian aid to the region
It has supported the victims of the second Chechnya conflict since its very beginning and will continue to do so
The Commission , through ECHO , has so far allocated more than EUR 90 million in humanitarian aid in order to help people survive
In 2002 alone , EUR 25 million have been allocated for this crisis and an additional EUR 3 million are now in the pipeline for more emergency food aid
In Ingushetia , at this very critical moment , ECHO provides support to internally displaced persons in camps , spontaneous settlements and host families
Most of the aid provided in the A@@ ki Y@@ ur@@ t camp had been funded by ECHO , and we will continue to be present in all other camps
In parallel , ECHO continues to fund a very large part of the humanitarian assistance going to Chechnya proper
We continue to argue with the Russian authorities on all these points as I have again and again informed this Parliament
as camps have now been set up in Ingushetia and masses of people deported , do you know where those people have gone ?
They use local drivers , but the whole organisation is provided by that NGO
This is also recognised by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and by the UN system in general
It is a very important achievement because it provides access for the humanitarian community
So the answer to the question of whether we are able to monitor the whole flow is that we are doing it as well as possible
However , so far we have not run into problems relating to accountability
We are trying to track every activity as carefully as possible
The input from the UN organisations is also crucial in this respect and our cooperation with them is quite well developed
This is why we are criticising the pressure that they are under
We will proceed to the second part of this Question Time , and we will begin with questions to Vice-President de Palacio
Ta@@ xation of fuel supplied in Gibraltar
It is no secret that this particular form of taking on fuel presents considerable environmental risks in terms of spillage , which has indeed occurred fairly frequently
The Commission believes that this practice should be carefully supervised in order to prevent dumping and marine pollution
These groups are always protected by legislation which is lax from environmental , commercial and fiscal points of view , and Gibraltar is no exception
I would like to ask whether or not there are tax differences in Gibraltar when compared to Al@@ g@@ ec@@ iras
The measures proposed are concrete evidence of the appropriate nature of the Treaty , whose provisions provide them with a solid and sufficient legal basis
In this way , health protection within the framework of radiation protection rules will be supplemented with nuclear safety provisions able to guarantee compliance with the radiation protection rules
I cannot stress too firmly that you should have come to discuss them with Parliament before briefing the press
I am very surprised to hear that you have a sufficient legal base
I understand that the Council is discussing this at the moment and that your nuclear proposals are based on the wrong legal framework
You have actually got it wrong , Commissioner
This is excluded under the Euratom Treaty
I would like you to clarify that you are not supporting plutonium reprocessing of in these proposals
And I did not present the initiatives to the press before this Parliament
On the contrary , I came here to inform Parliament of the initiatives I had proposed in Brussels
With regard to the legal basis , I would refer to the press release issued by the Luxembourg Court on 10 December
Finally , I do not support reprocessing in any way whatsoever
I do not know where the honourable Member has got these ideas from , I do not get into these types of issues
All I propose is that we must provide a framework for greatest possible degree of safety in all the countries of the Union
Independence exercised by the Commission
In June 2002 a delegation of the European Parliament 's Committee on Petitions travelled to Asturias at the invitation of the parliament of Asturias
That petition was declared admissible by the Committee on Petitions
On their return to Asturias the mayors told the media that the petition had been filed
How can a case be closed before the committee responsible has either seen or discussed it ?
Does the Commission not believe that its independence and the duty of confidentiality of the officials concerned have been affected ?
This type of visit to the Commission is normal
What we have to avoid when we are in the Commission , in Brussels , is losing contact with reality
Having said this , I cannot get into what the people who visit me say or the content of what they freely express
Now , what appears in the regional press is that the Commissioner and the officials say that this case is closed
It seems to me unfortunate to use the names of two officials from the Directorate-General for the Environment
The A@@ stu@@ rian petitioners quite rightly asked me how it could be that a case was closed when it had not even been discussed in the Committee on Petitions
It gri@@ eves me that your name and those of these two officials should be linked to a political issue which should not have appeared in the press in this way
Mr President , I am surprised that such experienced Members of Parliament should confuse a complaint to the Commission with a petition to the European Parliament
Such an important public communications infrastructure project as the ' auto@@ v@@ ía de Oc@@ ci@@ den@@ te ' motorway deserves all the support of all the A@@ stu@@ rian political representatives
Of course , it is not the duty of the Commission to resolve the final outcome of the petitions to the European Parliament , but of the MEPs
But let us not confuse complaints with petitions
Mr President , there has perhaps been a degree of confusion , as the honourable Member has said
All I can do is repeat that I cannot comment on the content of statements by people who visit me
With regard to the issue of complaints , this falls to Mrs Wallström
I have no knowledge but , in any event , I will be very happy to look into it and I will inform the honourable Member
The Members are aware that this is a time for questions and supplementary questions to the Commission , not for explanations and descriptions by the honourable Members
I very much respect your enthusiasm for debating and explaining the facts , but this is a Question Time
As the author is not present , Question No 47 , by Herman Ver@@ me@@ er , lapses
Star@@ ting date for Third Road Safety Action Plan
Can the Commission confirm the publication date of its communication on the Third Road Safety Action Plan ?
Can it provide advance information on the specific road safety measures which this plan will contain for two-@@ wheel@@ ed vehicles ?
This programme is being drawn up and it is scheduled to be adopted during the first quarter of 2003
The general measures will also have significant positive consequences for the safety of drivers and passengers of two-@@ wheel@@ ed vehicles
Mr President , I can tell you that there will be specific initiatives
With regard to the design of barriers , I would like to say that Mr Bautista Ojeda has produced initiatives on several occasions
We in the Commission are studying whether it is true that , in the construction of barriers , there are shapes and designs which are less harmful and safer
Their only answer - in some cases - is to turn to the insurance compensation consortium
This undoubtedly also relates to the problem of levels of danger and its physical and health consequences
Is the Commission aware of recent proposals from Ireland 's government-@@ owned rail freight operator , I@@ ar@@ n@@ ro@@ d Ei@@ reann , to withdraw from certain rail freight operations ?
This proposal would lead to an estimated additional 400 extra trucks involved in transporting freight by road each day
Ireland already has a serious traffic congestion problem due to inadequate road infrastructure , and any further shift from rail to road would greatly exacerbate this problem
Such a development would also run counter to the Commission 's rail freight strategy
Mr President , the transport White Paper clearly speaks of revitalising the railways throughout the European Union
In order to achieve this objective , the Community has taken various initiatives and has recently made proposals
The Community has co-financed various projects for development of the trans-European rail network in Ireland
For example , in 2000 , the projects received co-@@ funding of approximately EUR 3 million from the trans-European networks budget and around EUR 16 million from the Cohesion Fund
The Commissioner is probably aware that the Irish rail system is run by a state company in which the government is a shareholder
This state company has recently announced its intention to review its entire network , particularly the freight network , with the possibility that it may be closed entirely
Following the adoption of Directive 200@@ 2/@@ 3@@ 0/@@ EC
Directive 200@@ 2/@@ 3@@ 0/@@ EC lays down objectives and methods for resolving the problems of noise pollution in areas close to Community airports
This directive is one more measure in a series of measures intended to control exposure to noise around airports
The Commission does not plan to create a single charter of rights for people living near airports
This decision by the European Court of Human Rights could become case-law , to the advantage of people living near airports
What we need are effective European measures that would make it possible to decrease exposure to noise for people living near airports , particularly at night
In accordance with the Rules of Procedure , Question No 51 , by Mr Hatzidakis , will be replied to in writing
The main features of the contract on the purchase of the Commission 's Berlaymont building were revealed on 23 October last
The Commission 's total payment will be ? 5@@ 53 million and its share of the renovation cost is set at ? 50@@ 3 million which includes ? 35
What provisions have been made for public access to the new Berlaymont building ?
I am very glad that interest in the Berlaymont building is spreading
The creation of a new public space around the building and the provision of the security glass wall are just two of the consequences of that integra@@ tive approach
The design also ensures that , with the exception of some specialist technical installations , the Berlaymont will be fully accessible to people with mobility difficulties
All offices , meeting rooms , interpretation boo@@ ths and common spaces will be accessible either directly from the lifts or by integral ram@@ ps
E@@ asi@@ ly visible signs and markings everywhere will also be characteristic of the building
In order to benefit fully from this situation the Commission has launched a call for an expression of interest for the provision of office space
The final savings arising from these conditions can only be quantified precisely when the established location of all Commission offices in Brussels is clear
9 million and the annual step@@ -up of 2 % were determined when the Berlaymont contract was signed with the Belgian authorities , by me , in October
Other cost savings which cannot easily be quantified at this stage will include the reduction of transport and communication costs between Commission offices that are now dispersed
In addition the energy efficiency and environmentally-friendly technology of the Berlaymont , together with a design that will restra@@ in technical maintenance costs , will bring further savings
The financing costs issue - the third point raised by Mr Collins - is central to the project development
The major design characteristics of the Berlaymont have already won the International 2000 Pas@@ sive and Low Energy Arch@@ itec@@ ture A@@ ward for the best architec@@ tural design
A copy of an authoritative specialist article giving details of that will be sent directly to the Member concerned
It clearly demonstrates how investment in innovative techniques in installations reduces the running and energy consumption costs significantly
Many other aspects of the building design will keep the running costs to a minimum
For instance , the rain water on the site will be automatically collected and recycled for fl@@ ushing and for maintenance in hygiene facilities
In Brussels , I am very glad to say , the regularity of rain water is not in doubt
I thank the Commissioner for his usual , very comprehensive reply
He obviously anticipated many of the supple@@ ment@@ aries that I would be asking on behalf of my colleague , Mr Collins
I apologise for his absence
The Commissioner has solidly justified the expenditure in relation to the Berlaymont
I presume he has answered many of the questions the public in general have been asking , but I am not sure if those answers will be to their satisfaction
However , we must accept as credible the explanation given by the Commission , which I certainly do
Could he explain why it has taken so long to complete the building ?
In addition , the public in general is anxious to know how the original cost compares to the final cost ?
I shall summarise at this juncture in response to the precise points that Mr Hyland raised
One of the Commission 's fundamental aims throughout the negotiations on the contract on the Berlaymont was safeguarding the interests of the European taxpayer
This clearance took about two years longer than originally planned for
Secondly , the arrangements for managing the renovation of the Berlaymont were also delayed
The problem is that delay means cost , and one of our objectives was to ensure that we only accepted a fair share of the costs
We also wanted design adaptations to make the building fully accessible and state-of-the-art
The net result of all that is that the actual annual price that we will pay of EUR 31
Commission officials moving to private companies
The Commission encourages officials to move from the private to the public sector and vice versa
It even has arrangements allowing officials to work for a private company for a temporary period
That is a good thing in itself
However , the move by the head of the information policy division to Micro@@ soft raises questions , as the official concerned was involved in the anti@@ trust investigation into the company
The Commission 's spokesman has stated that the official was consulted by the Competition Directorate-General in connection with the investigation
What guarantees does the Commission have that EU officials who go to work in the private sector will not pass on crucial information to their new employers ?
Do written promises by those concerned provide sufficient guarantees ?
Does the Commission agree that new rules on the secondment of EU officials are urgently needed ?
If so , what precise steps does it intend to take ?
I am grateful to the honourable Member for raising this question
Lea@@ ve on personal grounds from the European Union civil service is governed by Article 40 of the Staff Regulations of O@@ ffici@@ als of the European Communities
That article contains provisions that enable an established official to be granted unpaid leave on personal grounds in exceptional circumstances and at his or her own request
The Commission 's view is that the institution benefits from such exchanges of expertise and experience and , in principle , it should therefore be encouraged
The Commission recognises that appointment to some posts could constitute - or appear to constitute - a conflict of interest
If an official or a former official who is working in the private sector made use of such privileged information , he or she would certainly face disciplinary proceedings
The purpose of the letter signed by the official mentioned in the honourable Member 's question was to signify his full awareness that these requirements always prevail and are unconditional
But your reply does not entirely satisfy me , Commissioner
I want to believe in the good faith - I certainly do believe in your own good faith , let that be clear - of this civil servant
But an impression has been created
He was working on the anti-@@ trust investigation into Micro@@ soft and he leaves to join that company
I think it should be made explicit what case is involved here
I should certainly like to ask in future for a far clearer and more enforceable framework of agreements
I should like once again to press the Commissioner on his future intentions
Is it feasible to create such a framework of agreements ?
Mr President , yes it is possible to have such a framework which is why I referred to the proposals now before the Council made by the Commission
It may be of interest to the honourable Member and the House to know that , at the moment , 5@@ 66 officials of the Commission are on personal leave
Four hundred cases have so far been examined , all will be examined
About 10 % - around about 40 people - are actually engaged in professional activities
The other 90 % are on personal leave because of family or educational obligations or they are undertaking external courses
When we have the final figures in the first week or so of next year I will certainly ensure that the honourable Member receives those in detail
As the author is not present , Question No 54 , by Mr Obi@@ ols i Germ@@ à , lapses
The Commission is naturally aware of the developments in the United States ' proceedings
I noted your saying it is important , partly in the interests of innovation , to consider relevant markets
We are now in a situation in which the software producers and a large part of the information society may be affected by this matter in the future
At what point does the Commissioner consider that a company may be in an especially dominant position ?
Will the Commission take account of those profit margins to which public reference is made , namely 85 % for certain types of software ?
When might the Commission be expected to reach that decision on this issue which European consumers are really waiting for ?
As to your question concerning the timing , our analysis of what is a very extensive file is well advanced
Once all the relevant information has been examined and assessed , we will be in a position to decide how best to proceed with the case
It would be realistic to expect a final conclusion in the first part of next year
This brings an end to this Question Time
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed , Questions Nos 56 to 102 will be replied to in writing
Mr O@@ sw@@ al@@ do Pay@@ á , allow me to express the emotion with which we welcome you today to award you the Sakharov Prize for freedom of thought
It has been difficult to obtain your leave and re-@@ entry visa for coming to Strasbourg
I am happy that this signal has been given to the European Parliament
You advocate national dialogue to enable democratic change in Cuba
You are working tirelessly to create an alternative , non-violent democratic movement , based on a wide coalition
Under your direction , the civil initiative ' the Varela project ' was born
This initiative calls for a referendum on open elections , freedom of speech , freedom for political prisoners and free enterprise
To date , the project has attracted support from more than 100 organisations in Cuba and tens of thousands of individual signatures
We recognise your end@@ ur@@ ance in the face of a bar@@ rage of obstacles
We recognise your personal courage
Throughout the years , the European Parliament has taken the lead in keeping human rights high on the policy agenda
This is not , on our part , an abstract commit@@ ment; it was forged in the tragic experiences of Europe 's barbaric twentieth century
It has been used over the last 50 years to construct a vision of Europe that has learned from , but not forgotten , its past
We are committed to the principles of democracy and respect for the universality and indi@@ visibility of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the rule of law
The Sakharov Prize celebr@@ ates that commitment annually
' We walk with you on your journey
You do not work in isolation
I would like to thank the President , Pat Cox , and this Parliament , which represents many of the peoples of Europe
You have awarded the Sakharov Prize to the people of Cu@@ ba@@ ; I say this because the Cuban people rich@@ ly deserve such recognition
I say this without excluding any of my compatriots , whatever their political position , because rights do not have any particular political , racial or cultural allegiance
Nor do dictatorships have any particular political allegiance , they are neither of the right nor of the left , they are simply dictatorships
In my country there are thousands of men and women fighting for the rights of all Cu@@ bans in the midst of persecution
Hundreds of them are imprisoned simply for proclaiming and defending these rights , and I am therefore accepting this award on behalf of them
We were all convinced of this , but there were times when it seemed that that truth was not so evident to many people in the world
I have not come here to ask for support for the opposition to the Cuban Government , nor to condemn those who persecute us
It is of no help to Cuba for some people in the world to take sides with the Cuban Government or with their opponents , on the basis of ideology
We want people to take sides with the Cuban people , with all Cu@@ bans
We ask for solidarity so that our people may be given a voice through the ballot box , as the Varela Project proposes
These changes would mean participation in economic and cultural life , they would mean political and civil rights and national reconciliation
This would represent the true exercise of self-determination for our people
We must put an end to the myth that we Cu@@ bans must live without rights in order to sustain the independence and sovereignty of our country
Father F@@ é@@ li@@ x Varela taught us that independence and national sovereignty are inseparable from the exercise of fundamental rights
We have not chosen the peaceful route as a tactic , but because it is inseparable from the goal of our people
Experience shows us that violence creates more violence and that when political changes are carried out in this way , it leads to new forms of oppression and injustice
Our wish is that violence and force are never again used to overcome crises or unjust governments
In that way we will build a true peace
The heroic Cuban civic fighters , the citizens who sign the Varela Project , are not carrying arms
We do not have a single weapon
We are holding out both arms , offering our hands to all Cu@@ bans , as brothers , and to all the peoples of the world
The first victory we can claim is that we do not have hate in our hearts
That is the liberation we are proclaiming
Furthermore , the hands of the citizens are tied , neutr@@ alising the Cu@@ bans ' enormous potential for creativity and hard work
That is the main cause of our poverty
This reality cannot be justified by claiming that the Cuban people freely chose this system
The honourable Members know that none of the peoples represented in this Parliament , nor any people in the world , would ever surrender the exercise of their fundamental rights
It is made ever clearer that social and economic well-being and progress are the fruit of the exercise of rights
Because no peoples exercise their right to vote freely in order to chose poverty and inequality , which reduce the masses to a situation of disadvantage and marginalisation
Our Latin American peoples are calling for a real democracy , which is one within which justice can be built
It is not my intention to proclaim new positions or models , but our people have experienced and suffered various political and economic systems
We wish to express here our solidarity with all people suffering any kind of oppression or injustice , or who are silen@@ ced or margin@@ ali@@ zed throughout the world
The cause of human rights is a single one , just as we have one single humanity
Without human solidarity neither will we conserve a clean world in which it remains possible for human beings to live
It is therefore my humble opinion that , rather than new models , either for societies or for relations between countries , what we need is a new spirit
This new spirit must be expressed through solidarity , cooperation and justice in relations between countries and will not hinder development
May our message from Cuba of Peace and Solidarity reach all peoples
We place our hopes in the Lord , who was laid in a humble man@@ ger , and this is our homage to Hi@@ m
Madam President , it was nearly two years ago that the Commission adopted its proposal for a directive establishing quality and safety requirements for blood and blood components
This was presented to the Council and Parliament in January 2001
Considerable work has been done since then , and I welcome the constructive way in which the proposal has been addressed both in Parliament and in the Council
Parliament has now reached a major milestone in its consideration of this proposal
I very much hope that the Commission 's proposal for a directive on tissues and cells will be considered with the same interest and efficiency
Madam President , I thank the Commissioner
His contribution was short and sweet but at this stage most of the talking has been done
I would like to thank my colleague in abs@@ enti@@ a , Mr Nisticò , for the enormous amount of work he has done on this particular directive
It has come back to us from conciliation quite satisfactorily
The compromise is that both Parliament and the Council have agreed on a qualified health professional
In the spirit of conciliation that is quite satisfactory
Others might give it another name , but it gets us to where we want to be at this point
I thank all those who spent a lot of time and effort in getting to this position
The directive before us deals with the collection , testing , processing , storage and distribution of human blood
It is quite a contentious issue in many of our Member States , not least in our own
Other countries have had similar experiences
This new directive , together with the existing Directive 89/3@@ 8@@ 1/@@ EEC , will ensure that binding Community legislation will apply now to blood and blood products whatever the intended purpose
There was quite a lot of contention at earlier readings on this directive as to whether all donations had to be voluntary or un@@ remunerated
That should be the cul@@ ture; that must be the ethos we foster
While we should never risk rare blood groups or rare blood products being unavailable to patients through our unwillingness to pay , that must be the exception
Pay@@ ment can take many forms in terms of expenses or just compensating for lost hours at work , as distinct from profit in terms of payment
We must continue with the voluntary ethos
I welcome the return of this report from conciliation and I hope it will not be too long before all our Member States transpose it and it becomes law
I should like to thank Mr Nisticò and Commissioner Byrne for the sterling work they have done on this matter
The outcome of the conciliation will mean our now having obtained high minimum levels of safety and quality where blood and blood components used for transfusion are concerned
Re@@ qui@@ rements are being set in terms of staff qualifications , the operation of blood banks , the testing of donated blood and also efficient supervision and monitoring
The most controversial issue has of course been that of whether blood should be given without the donors ' actually being remunerated
I believe it is well documented that voluntary and un@@ remunerated donation provides the best blood quality , especially if there is a permanent body of donors
I am nonetheless very pleased that the directive now refers to the European Council 's proper definition of un@@ remunerated blood donation
I definitely think that the directive we have now arrived at will make an important contribution to the safety and the quality of blood donation in Europe
It is a great pity he is not here this evening to reap the rewards , as it were
That said , I am glad that this joint text was adopted in the Conciliation Committee
Blood monitoring networks are a vital tool for making the transfusion chain as safe as possible
I am pleased to see that common sense has won the day , as of the second reading
In this regard , determined implementation of a policy to provide patients with re@@ comb@@ in@@ ant factors is more necessary than ever in Europe
The Liberal Group also wanted the text to contain a reference to scientific and technical progress
This concern was addressed in Article 29 , which , in particular , lays down clear guidelines for establishments performing blood trans@@ fu@@ sions
Lastly , the conciliation procedure has put the finishing touches to the excellent work carried out by the three institutions on this matter
The only point of contention , which I shall mention briefly , is the matter of medical examination prior to donation , which has already been raised
I am pleased , once again , that the Conciliation Committee considers it sufficient to require this examination to be carried out by a qualified health professional
I believe it is silly , as I have said since first reading , to go against certain national practices that give excellent results
The European Union is not immune to accidents , of course , or even the appearance of a new virus
North America is currently experiencing a blood product safety alert caused by a virus from a western island
We must therefore increase monitoring , apply the early detection principle for any use of blood , and ensure traceability from donor to recipient
That is the price of establishing a blood chain that will renew the confidence of European citizens
Madam President , I am pleased to be able to speak this evening about this particularly important , even vital , matter , in the true meaning of the term
Blood donations , as many will know , have an in@@ comparable human dimension , which concerns us all
They only concern France , I am afraid , but I would imagine they could generally be applied to most of the Member States of the Union
In France , 8 000 donations are required every day to save 60 000 lives each year and carry out 800 000 trans@@ fu@@ sions
The victim of a road accident might need the participation of ten to thirty people to ensure their survival , and yet only 5 % of people give blood
We are therefore entitled to ask why there are so few blood donors
I know the European Commission understood - and I thank it for that - a fundamental part of the problem when defining the objective of its proposal for December 2000
Its aim is to increase public confidence in the safety of blood and blood products and thus achieve self-sufficiency within the European Union
Without for@@ giving or forgetting anything , I would prefer to concentrate on three questions
What must we do now to restore this confidence ?
How can we encourage people to give blood more frequently and persuade more people to give ?
Thirdly , does the solution not lie in the remuneration of donors , as certain European States already practise this system ?
In response to this last question , I would say straight away that the answer , for me , is ' no '
Blood and blood products are not goods
Blood donations must therefore remain based on the principles of free consent , anonymity and benevol@@ ence
I feel this is something that should not even be up for discussion
The proposal put forward in this area is along the right lines
It has been strengthened and clarified to very positive effect by the European Parliament
I shall take this opportunity to congratulate Professor Nisticò warmly on the quality of his work
For all these reasons , Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I can vote in favour of this report and would call on you to do the same
For Finns the end result will not , however , be spot on , as it were
Parliament accepted my amendment regarding the non-remuneration of blood donation in the first reading in September 2001 , but we had to yield in the end
In the actual Article that concerns non-remuneration the hope is expressed that blood and blood components should be derived as far as possible from this type of donation
The non-remuneration principle was resisted with the argument that it was hard to obtain rare blood products
I myself would have resolved the matter in individual cases without opening the floodgates to remuneration for all blood products
Many patient groups and authorities at one time appealed to Parliament not to allow the commercialisation of blood donation
First of all , there is a safety risk involved
There is also an ethical risk
We have a responsibility for the extent to which the rest of the world copies what we do
If we allow trade in human body parts and blood we have to consider that the less developed countries will follow Europe 's example
This could lead not only to exploitation but increased risk
Furthermore , several Member States are signatories to a bio@@ ethical agreement which categorically forbi@@ ds the economic exploitation of the human body and its parts , including blood
I hope that when in time this directive is reviewed , we will also consider the part the principle of non-remuneration has to play
It is essential that matters like these that are so important for human life , such as the quality of blood and its safety , are guaranteed everywhere in Europe
For this reason , I think progress was being made in this matter when the objective was voluntary donation and non-remuneration
It must certainly be considered regrettable that this objective has not been fully realised , although I believe we shall move in this direction in future discussions on the subject
The wording of the conciliation decision also refers to this
As has been said here , blood or its components cannot be commercial goods
This is more about a gift from one person to another and that is the way it should be seen
we also have to have confidence in others than those practising the profession of doctor
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
The next item is the Commission statement on the presence of nitro@@ fur@@ ans and other prohibited substances in poultry and shri@@ m@@ ps
Commissioner , you have the floor
This system involves the setting up of a residue monitoring plan as well as a legal framework to allow for official controls and a practical infrastructure for laboratory testing
This legislation requires Member States and third countries exporting to the EU to submit annually a monitoring plan for residues in products of animal origin
The residue plans are subject to an extensive evaluation procedure
Only those third countries that have submitted satisfactory residue monitoring plans are allowed to export to the European Union and be included in the appropriate list
This list is kept under constant review in order to take into account the results of the evaluation of the annual updates of residue monitoring plans
However , this approach must be complemented by measures on the ground
First , import controls must be carried out by the Member States at the external borders of the Union
Secondly , the Food and Veterinary Office veri@@ fies how the residue plans are implemented in the Member States and third countries
Over the last year , we have been particularly concerned about discoveries of banned veterinary medicinal products - namely ch@@ lor@@ am@@ phen@@ ic@@ ol and nitro@@ fur@@ ans - in food of animal origin
The Commission has not hesitated to take measures whenever this problem has arisen
These measures taken in third countries are complemented by strict , mandatory import controls to provide sufficient guarantees
This is the case for both Thailand and Brazil
The Commission will ensure the maintenance of the necessary level of scrutiny on imported products to ensure a consistent approach to consumer safety
The Rapid Al@@ ert System for Food and Fe@@ ed is the tool to disseminate all relevant information between Member States and the Commission , as well as to third countries
Let me say that it is not just in relation to third country imports that the Commission has identified problems of residues in food
Indeed , residues monitoring plans carried out by Member States also enabled the identification of contamination cases in food produced in the European Union
Perhaps I should explain the background to this
Indeed the Commission has postponed a number of planned missions in respect of residues
These include missions to Brazil and Thailand
Con@@ sign@@ ments which test positive are destroyed
These measures are necessary because there are serious failings in residue controls in the countries concerned
It is not necessary to send a mission team to establish what is already known
It is premature to carry out a mission now , as the Commission is not convinced that the necessary preparatory measures have been put in place
Instead it is considered best to await concrete evidence of progress in the form of regulatory controls , such as legislation and so on
That is the position in regard to the issues that have been raised in the questions
I am happy to outline that for Parliament
Madam President , Commissioner , I think this is a very wide ranging and difficult subject
I have listened very carefully to what you have said and I come now to a topic that I would have liked to have put before you earlier in writing
But I believe that a joint effort may perhaps still e@@ licit an answer from you
N@@ it@@ ro@@ fur@@ ans is a generic term
One very important product it covers is Ni@@ fur@@ so@@ l
Ni@@ fur@@ so@@ l is the last his@@ tom@@ on@@ ost@@ at still to be permitted in the EU for use as an additive in poultry feed to prevent black@@ head disease
I admit I am not a scientist
According to my information , however , experts say that this product was banned for good in Regulation 23@@ 7@@ 7/@@ 90
The Scientific Committee for Animal Nu@@ tri@@ tion was asked by the Commission to make a risk assessment of Ni@@ fur@@ so@@ l
Investig@@ ations that will give a definite answer have yet to be carried out
As a logical consequence of the ban on nitro@@ fur@@ ans in Regulation 23@@ 7@@ 7/@@ 90 , Regulation 17@@ 5@@ 6/@@ 2002 was issued on 23 September 2002 , banning Ni@@ fur@@ so@@ l from 31 March 2003
When this ban comes into force on 31 March , there will , for example , be a crisis in the treatments used to combat black@@ head disease in tur@@ keys
No alternative remedy is available legally in the EU , either as a feed additive or as a veterinary medicine
The consequences of the ban will hit both fatten@@ ers and consumers
Only last week antibiotics of the nitro@@ fur@@ an group that are banned in the EU were found again in cheap imports of meat from third countries
what solutions do we now have available ?
I therefore have a few questions
What are we to say to the fatten@@ ers ?
What forms of treatment are available to them ?
I think I can be brief but would very much like to respond to the Commissioner 's reply
I believe that it is particularly important to acknowledge the problem in the first instance
I believe this is precisely where the sticking point is
I come from Belgium where we had the dioxin crisis , which is certainly not unknown to you
On that occasion , the Commission acted in a draconian manner against Belgium
You were right , quite right to take strict measures and one of your main accusations related to the fact that the Member State failed to give sufficient information
I believe that we are now in a similar situation
I should have therefore preferred a number of more concrete answers to the questions , since I do not have the impression that you dealt with them properly
I also think that you can provide a better answer in order to reassure the consumer that what eventually finds its way onto his plate is safe
Madam President , Commissioner , there are two areas that give us cause for concern
The question is , who produces these substances and how can they get into the European Union ?
You have now said there are intensive controls , but - if I understood that correctly - foreign missions are unnecessary because we find bad conditions there anyway
I have heard that today 's meeting of the Standing Committee was to have discussed removing Thailand again from the list of countries that must be subject to special inspections
On what basis was that decision to be taken ?
I have also heard that you have announced inspection missions to those countries for next year
What reason do you now have to assume that those missions will be worthwhile ?
There is another problem that needs to be clarified
What happens to the shri@@ m@@ ps , poultry meat and tur@@ key that is imported into the Union and does not meet our requirements ?
As we have been saying about food waste for a long time , a ban is not enough
We saw that with the shri@@ m@@ ps from China , which somewhere found their way into animal feed and by that route got into the food chain again
I hope you will be able to clear this up in your reply
Madam President , it seems like only yesterday that the Commissioner and I were talking about other issues regarding the safety of some of these foodstuffs
Does the Commissioner still believe that his statement of 28 June was a necessary and sufficient answer to the concerns that have been raised ?
If the Commissioner did not say that , then I mis@@ heard him
The issue is not only what happens within the Member State - as the Commissioner knows , there have been a whole series of rapid aler@@ ts during 2002
I would like to know whether or not he feels that poultry imports from countries like Brazil give cause for serious concern
My information is that something like 2000 tonnes of Braz@@ ili@@ an poultry have entered the EU in this way
How close does the Commissioner believe we are to achieving 100 % safety testing in the Member States ?
Why are these missions being postponed ?
Is the SA@@ NC@@ O DG under pressure from other directorates ?
Are there questions here about endangering trade talks , meaning that one should not throw suspicion on any other states ?
If that is the case , it is not a sufficient answer to give to those whose primary concern is - as is the Commission 's - food safety
Finally , how soon will these proposed missions take place ?
The Commissioner said earlier today in the debate on foot and mouth disease that he did not like disguised forms of protectionism - nor do I
However , I do not like disguised forms of conce@@ al@@ ment either , where there is a risk
If the money is not available and that is why these FVO missions have been postponed - tell us so
There are members of the Committee on Budgets here now
Parliament is very keen to support you , but we need cand@@ our in order to do it
Madam President , Commissioner , in the past we might have talked about pigs ' ears , today it looks more like fish@@ y go@@ ings-@@ on
This communication is dated 25 November , but only today , nearly four weeks later , is there an early alert
Why were four weeks allowed to elapse ?
I would like you to give me , and Luxembourg 's consumers , a clear answer
My second question is this
On 2 October you relaxed controls for Vietnam
That is a Commission decision
Mr President , firstly I would like to say how grateful I am to Members of Parliament for raising these important issues
However , I will do my best to answer such questions as you have raised
I have taken notes and if I am not able to deal with technical issues of a specific nature , I will respond to the questioner in writing
The issues that have been raised centre around the question of why the inspections were suspended and when these inspections will be resumed
Therefore it is important that they reveal any residues in any of the foods that are designated for testing
When the tests show positive , I want to confirm , as I indicated earlier , that these products are destroyed
I confirm to the House considerations of that kind never impinge on a decision in relation to food safety
I have made that point here in this Parliament on many occasions and I am happy to repeat it now
No other political or trade consideration is ever taken into account
That is a very serious decision to take
I know that you have concerns about the welfare of and benefits to developing countries also
This is not an in@@ considerable issue
In deciding what is an appropriate response , we have to take into account all of these considerations and make sure that we come to proportionate responses
One of the most difficult aspects of my job in dealing with food safety is to come up with solutions that are proportionate
Very often , when you are too hard , people will point that out
Sometimes when they believe that you are too weak , the other side will point that out
It is not always possible to keep everybody happy on all occasions
That appears to me to be the proportionate response to the risk that may have been identified
All the time we keep this under review
As a consequence , a ban was placed on the importation of chickens , crust@@ aceans , honey and one or two other products
That was the appropriate response in those circumstances
But we have not reached that view in respect of the two countries I have identified
The more detailed and technical questions that have been raised by many of you I have taken note of
I will ensure that each of you receives a response in writing in due course
The debate is closed
This joint text could not have been prepared without the efficient work of the Danish Presidency - who will receive the message - and the Commission either , of course
It is found at high concentrations , in particular in breast milk , with a significant risk of contamination in infants
There was therefore unanimity with regard to this first substance
Having said this , Parliament , in its vote of September 2001 , also wanted this proposal to cover the two sister substances , oc@@ tab@@ ro@@ modiphenyl ether and dec@@ ab@@ ro@@ modiphenyl ether
In this kind of matter , where chemical substances are in the dock , debate is always tricky
We needed to establish a fragile balance between obvious advantages in terms of fire safety and equally proven disadvantages in some cases in terms of health and the environment
This pressure contributed to the swift , eventually negative conclusion of the risk assessment and convinced the Council to support us in prohibiting the use of this substance
So much effort has been put into reaching this agreement in the Conciliation Committee
It has taken almost ten years for brominated fire retardants , which are included in the list of priority substances , to be assessed at last
The joint text to be submitted to Parliament tomorrow fulfils this dual objective
For all these reasons , I would ask my fellow Members to support it
It is a far-reaching proposal as it bans the marketing and use of all articles containing these substances
The proposed directive will therefore encourage the marketing and use of safer alternatives
We were therefore able to include ' oc@@ ta ' in this directive
The Commission believes that this is a positive outcome
Considering the discussions about the extension of the ban to the third brominated flame retardant , deca@@ BDE , this requires further examination and fin@@ alisation of the currently ongoing risk assessment
Sim@@ ul@@ tane@@ ously , a risk reduction strategy will be developed
This is an important step in the procedure
As the risk assessment procedure and the risk reduction strategy will be completed in the next few months , the Commission will soon be able to propose justified measures
In conclusion , I am very glad about the successful cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council and hope that this important directive can now be finalised
Madam President , like the previous two speakers I welcome this report and I praise the rapporteur for her work
Furthermore , Parliament was dissatisfied with the speed at which the risk assessment was being carried out , as this was delaying any real concrete decisions
they are very effective flame retardants and they save lives
However , they appear to have dangerous effects on the environment and public health and , therefore , we felt something had to be done
I am sure that Parliament is pleased that the original proposal is now developed and that oc@@ ta@@ B@@ De has also been banned
However , Parliament cannot be totally happy about the fate of deca@@ BDE , which remains to be decided
Parliament would like a clear date for action on this
The fate of this remaining substance is still hanging in the balance
I hope the Commissioner will confirm that tonight
On this basis , the PSE Group can support this proposal , which will be put to the vote tomorrow morning
Madam President , Mrs Ries has done an excellent job of reporting on the negotiations at conciliation and on the problems that have arisen in connection with these
A longer wait will involve further risks to public health
These substances are long-@@ lived and bio-@@ accumul@@ ative
They are stored in living organisms , and they cause changes in the behaviour of animals used in experiments
Dec@@ a may also be converted into pentaBDE and octaBDE , which are precisely what the Council wishes to ban
It can also be converted into brominated dioxins
In June 2002 , the competent authority for the Member States considered it was necessary to take measures without delay
In conclusion , I have to say that the outcome is a failure in terms of EU environmental and health policy
I therefore believe that Mrs Ries will understand why my group will abstain from voting in the final vote
Mr President , I should like very much to thank Mrs Ries for the sterling work she has done on this matter
It is of course a good example of the European Parliament 's being able to promote the protection of the environment and of public health in Europe
That is why I shall vote in favour of the conciliation proposal and the outcome of the conciliation in the final vote tomorrow
Mr President , there was a direct question about the timing of the Commission proposal
If that is the case , the Commission will be able to make a proposal by June next year
My reply to Mr Bowe is therefore ' yes '
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Madam President , this is a difficult text
Over the last 18 months a lot of people have asked me , ' What is all this that you are doing in Europe with electronic waste ?
What is the point of it ? '
Six million tonnes of electronic waste every year contain an enormous quantity of valuable materials that we want to reuse in future
That is the reason for this directive
They enabled us to reach agreement on difficult points
We have set binding targets
Unfortunately , Europe is always outstanding in its unlimited use of undefined legal terms
The hurdles we have set in this directive today are not very high , but they are nevertheless defined and binding
I think that can be called a success
Unfortunately , we are still rather vague about how such materials will be treated in future , but we have used the best available technology
I know only too well that in my country the term ' best available technology ' is interpreted in 16 different ways , because Germany has 16 federal states
There are bound to still be loopholes , but we have nevertheless made real progress in the field of recycling quotas , too
I believe the quotas for industry are achievable and no one can say we are asking too much
In 2005 , citizens will be able to take their products to a collection point free of charge , unless the Member State goes a step further
The Member States can decide that individually
I think our agreement on ' individual financing ' was a great success
There were actually countries that did not want to take this approach
I am pleased to say that by working night and day with the help of other members in other groups we were able to persuade them to agree after all
We may have succeeded in shutting out the free ri@@ ders that there always are with such a system
The important thing is the guarantee that it is done , and the text reflects that concern
I believe this was also a good step
Unfortunately , we are still very fond of using new primary materials but always tend to turn up our no@@ ses at secondary materials
I might go so far as to say we should give such secondary raw materials preferential VAT treatment
That is not necessarily my group 's normal position
I do , however , believe it would be an incentive to bring about real sustainability in this area
That is what it is really about , ladies and gentlemen
We want to reuse raw materials in future
I was also very pleased to have the NGOs fighting alongside us on this question and that the undertakings and NGOs adopted a joint resolution in support of our efforts
Nothing like that has happened before in the time I have been in this House - and that is thirteen and a half years
I would at this point also like to thank those colleagues who stayed on board in difficult moments
There are always plenty who fall by the wayside when the going gets tough
Basically , though , this directive does have two parts
The second part is the question of how we are to deal with hazardous substances such as cadmium , lead and h@@ ex@@ aval@@ ent ch@@ ro@@ mi@@ um in future
I think we have made a small amount of progress here
Ultimately , this is about collecting and concentrating , for example , stray lead from light bulbs , small radi@@ os and small appliances with which we are all familiar
Ten tonnes of lead in one place are absolutely harmless
The same amount in small pieces all over the place , however , is a problem
May I once again thank my colleagues , you , Commissioner , and your staff , who always rendered us excellent assistance whenever we were faced with major questions
I was proud of this European House and would be pleased if in future things could continue in the same way with the next directives
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I too am very pleased that these two important directives have now finally reached the last stage of the decision-making process
The type of waste that prolifer@@ ates most quickly today is waste from electrical or electronic products
The average European produces approximately 14 kg of this type of waste every year
Most of it ends up on tips or in waste incinerators
These new directives are important milestones that will make it easier to get to grips with the future environmental problems to which our waste may lead
That is because we can now select this type of equipment for recycling and re-use and in that way also reduce its potentially dangerous effects
Through the new directives , the Member States will be responsible for ensuring that waste from electrical and electronic products is collected separately from other waste
The directives also set a binding collection target of 4 kg per inhabitant per year from private households
In accordance with the European Parliament 's proposal , individual responsibility must form the basis for this collection target
I believe that these solutions are a great success for the European Parliament and for cooperation with the Council in the conciliation committee
This is an important step for environmental policy
I should also like once again to thank Mr Florenz , who is always easy to collaborate with
Madam President , I would also like to thank the Conciliation Committee for its constructive work
It has been a very good success for Parliament and indeed for the European citizens
Waste from electronic and electrical equipment is now one of the fastest growing waste streams in the European Union
As the Commissioner has said , it constitutes almost 14 kilograms per head and is growing by at least 3 % to 5 % every year
Electronic and electrical equipment is one of the largest known sources of heavy metals and organic pollutants in the waste stream
Without proper pre-@@ treatment the highly toxic components can contaminate soil and ground water , as well as polluting the air
The need for business to adapt to a changing agenda , taking more account of environmental concerns , is becoming more widely accepted
Indeed business and the environmental NGOs have been on the same wavelength during this process , which is not always the case
It is also accepted that countries and industries which innovate more quickly will end up being more competitive than those which delay
The adoption of this directive will be a signal in that regard
The guiding principle behind the directive is the extent of producers ' responsibility
In addition there is reuse of resources and separate collection , and hazardous substances contained in the WEEE are prevented from entering the environment
The directive also applies the principle of internalisation of external costs
Hence the ultimate aim is waste prevention , thus sustainability
Madam President , I wish to join with the others in complimenting all involved , particularly on bringing this through conciliation successfully
I thank him for his commitment and belief in both these directives
Colleagues have indicated the rate at which WEEE is growing
It is interesting to know that it will grow three times faster than the average municipal waste by 2010 - quite a frightening concept
We can insist on improved product design , and that will facilitate recycling and the disposal of products at the end of their life
It is against this background that the two directives must be reviewed
I hope our officials , ministers and others who agreed to the targets and timetables did so realistically , because we should not commit ourselves to something we cannot deliver
Each manufacturer of new products should cover its own costs , and the collection and treatment of all new products can be done collectively
Let us be sure that technologically we are able to replace with a safer product , as far as the environment is concerned , what we are about to ban
Mr President , Commissioner , rapporteur , I shall be brief for two reasons
Firstly , I find it rather silly having the same debate here with exactly the same people for the third time in plenary
The second reason is perhaps more important , however , and strikes a very positive note
This can scarcely be called a deb@@ ate; these are statements by people who actually agree with each other to a large extent
That is the nice thing about the procedure we have been through since , during the first reading , that was absolutely not the case
During the discussion we have gradually come closer together
In that respect , we are a strong Parliament and a strong delegation in the negotiations
As a result , the major aspects that we put forward have actually emerged
It is no coincidence that the rapporteur should have d@@ wel@@ t at length on the concept of individual producer responsibility
I shall not expand on it yet again , but it is of crucial importance
It constitutes a precedent and it is the way in which we must proceed in the months and years ahead in our environmental policy
And yet , I should like to set that straight
It is not a matter of collective organisation , but of collective funding
I should like to mention a few other points that are important because none of them have been fully achieved
I am thinking , for example , of binding targets
It is true that we have binding targets , but we had to rein in the level of these
We went from 6 to 4 kilograms
I am also saying this to my British fellow MEPs
We are not top of the class in the environmental field , but , as regards waste prevention and waste recycling , we are
We are doing that to tight deadlines
If the political will is there , you can meet tight deadlines
That is why binding targets are good in themselves
What I find particularly deplorable is the question of exporting
We simply export a host of problems
In that respect , we have not achieved our target for legal reasons
I accept this regretfully , but I think we must ensure that this problem is solved through other means
I conclude with a final point that I personally have always defended , namely recycling
The principle is contained in the directive
I hope that , next time , we shall be able to achieve concrete targets regarding recycling too
It remains for me to thank the rapporteur and my fellow MEPs most warmly for the pleasant cooperation we have enjoyed in the course of the night
I learned a lot and enjoyed myself greatly
Mr President , now I know at last how European laws are really made
It is a splendid piece of legislation
It is not the end , but it is a good beginning and much credit goes to both the Commission and our rapporteur
I am particularly pleased with the principle of individual producer responsibility , which has been so firmly embraced
Within the last week we have seen two good illu@@ strations of the way in which industry is responding to it professionally and effectively
And the mobile phone manufacturers of the world have agreed to cooperate to ensure the environmentally sound management of their end-of-life products
My principal concern relates to - and I echo Mrs Doyle 's words - the implementation of the directive
Just a few weeks ago government representatives in that room in the Council committed themselves to this legislation at the conciliation meeting
It is all supposed to be transposed into national law in about 18 months ' time
But judging from our experience with the end-of-life vehicles directive , that will not be the case so far as many Member States are concerned
The UK Government has still not transposed Mr Florenz 's legislation
Finally , the text of Article 4 was the matter I referred to in my opening remarks
It will probably take a British judge to make them recognise the obvious truth , that a car@@ tri@@ dge fitted with an electronic chip is an item of electronic equipment
I wish you and members of the conciliation delegation , and the Commissioner and her staff , a mer@@ ry Christmas
I should also like to congratulate rapporteur , Mr Florenz
This is an historic breakthrough
Ten years ago , we , as the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , proposed individual producer responsibility in the packaging directive
At that time , we were laughed out of court
In the case of car wrecks we were almost successful two years ago
the manufacturers will become one hundred per cent responsible for electrical and electronic waste
It is not the case that the industry was united on the matter
The largest company in the field in my country , Phili@@ ps , was decidedly antagonistic
Mr President , the concerns about increasing quantities of electrical and electronic equipment entering the waste system have been well rehear@@ sed
There can be no dispute that this type of waste is a problem
Furthermore , there is no dispute that the problem will continue to grow
However , there is a world of difference between agreeing that something is a problem and agreeing with a proposed solution
My purpose in making this address , therefore , is to enter into the record my total disagreement with this directive
My central objection is that the directive is economically illiterate
Its effect will be to create massive quantities of materials in a highly volatile market
When quantities increase as a result of this directive , the value of recycled materials will drop , making the economics of recycling extremely uncertain
On this basis , producers and eventually their customers , are being asked to sign a blank cheque
Neither does any serious consideration seem to have been given to the problem of labour recruitment
Sal@@ v@@ aging materials is highly labour-intensive yet the work is un@@ attractive
Either wages will have to go up sharply to meet the demand for more staff or the scheme will be be@@ dev@@ illed by labour shortages
The recycling plants required to meet this directive are highly capit@@ al-@@ intensive
With such uncertain returns it seem unlikely that there will be any commitment to providing the necessary facilities
It also requires Member States to create yet more criminal offences to regulate the commercial market
Is turning our businessmen into criminals really what European unity is really all about ?
Is this really what Monnet planned ?
Surely there is a better way
One could find that , as with the car bat@@ teries ' recycling - before the EU destroyed it - a new market would be created
With that degree of cooperation the most expensive part of the scheme - collection costs - are minimised
If you need an explanation as to why there is growing disen@@ chan@@ tment with the European Union , just look at this directive and the many more like it
Mr President , the report by my colleague , Mr Florenz , is one of the most important achievements this parliamentary term from Parliament 's point of view
Firstly , producers are now to be made responsible for the complete life cycles of the equipment they sell
The unambiguous application of individual producer liability is something that I , as the person who originally proposed the amendment , am especially glad about
This is precisely the way we can ensure that product design takes account of the environment and therefore the directive 's whole viability
there will be positive incentives to encourage more ecological behaviour
I hope that the Member States also find a fair solution regarding how collection facilities are organised
In so far as it is possible , it will be the responsibility of the local authorities , and the producer 's liability for costs starts at the collection point
I believe that we have found an excellent model in the WEEE Directive , which , hopefully soon , we will be able to apply to many other product groups
Mr President , I agree with everyone who has spoken tonight
This is a substantial and very important proposal
When fully implemented it will bring about a transformation in the culture of recycling in many Member States
The rapporteur can be truly proud of his work and he is to be congratulated on it
Pati@@ ence must be shown with some Member States that are starting from scratch and have very little infrastructure for recycling
However , we may see the unfortunate situation of local authorities - and consequently local taxpayers - dealing with orphan and some historic waste
In that situation , the governments that have agreed to this proposal have a responsibility to support financially this necessary work
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I , too , would like to thank Mr Florenz for this report
I would particularly like to thank him because he initially took quite a different position on the end-of-life vehicles directive
I think it is a sign of great@@ ness to change your position and make clear that producer liability is possible
I therefore believe it is a very great success not only for the environment but also for consumer protection
In this way , we are also giving industry incentives to pursue not only environmentally friendly policies but also consumer-friendly ones
I would , however , also ask the Commission to strictly control and enforce this individual financing later
Only then will this directive really be a milestone in environmental and consumer protection
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would also like to begin by offering Karl-Heinz Florenz my warmest congratulations
He has put his heart into his report , he has fought for it and I believe he has achieved a good result
I believe putting the focus on firms ' own liability goes to the heart of the problem
In future , these firms will be able to participate in public tenders , serve local and regional public institutions and invite tenders
That means things can get much cheaper for consumers
One problem that of course arises for small and medium-sized firms is how they are to provide a guarantee for various services
It is important that national , regional or local political decision makers give some thought to how they can help small and medium-sized undertakings over guarantees in the future
Another point is the bans on substances
Consum@@ ption and costs must not be allowed to increase in certain areas because of the bans , putting a counterproductive burden on the system
All in all , I believe the discussion has been most worthwhile
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
I myself have been a steadfast advocate of Parliament 's opinions , as in many ways we are dealing with matters that have to do with Parliament 's essential function
First of all , with this directive we are granting the public important new rights
Secondly , we are endorsing the principles of good administration and transparency
Thirdly , we are promoting sustainable development in the manner outlined at the Rio Summit
In addition , we are ensuring that our citizens have a healthy environment
It would be impossible to fit more central issues to the European Parliament than these into a single directive
The exceptionally large number of differing opinions with regard to amendments was a special challenge during conciliation
This is not just any solution , either
This is a directive that represents Parliament 's opinion in a significant way and one that meets the minimum requirements of the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention fully and even goes beyond them
The most important details of the outcome of conciliation are those that relate to exceptional circumstances
As a result of conciliation the opportunities to resort to these are limited , meaning real transparency can be achieved
When charges do apply they must be reasonable and must not exceed the costs incurred in providing the material in question
A third important outcome of the negotiations is that a special new section on the requirements for the quality of environmental information was approved for the directive
Member States must ensure that the information is up to date , accurate , and , above all , capable of being used for comparisons
With regard to emissions , measurement procedures must also be disclosed so that comparisons can be made
Another good result is that the authorities will have an obligation to assist and advise people seeking information so that they can apply their rights in the best possible way
Other practical arrangements agreed in the directive are also viable and fair from the point of view of the authorities that are responsible for implementing them
The objective of the directive that is being realised least satisfactorily in fact is the aim to bring it up to date with developments in information technology
Luckily , we had a special statement approved that said that developments in telecommunications and electronic media would be taken into special consideration in a re-examination of the directive
In this way they will not be taking up the time of the authorities in attending to their request
I warmly recommend the acceptance of this outcome of conciliation in tomorrow 's vote
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this directive really is a very important step forwards
Furthermore , the authorities are responsible for ensuring that the databases are equipped with the required search engines
Ex@@ tensive and uncomplicated access to environmental information will increase people 's knowledge and understanding of environmental issues , together with their general awareness of these issues
That is why this is an important step forwards
In conclusion , I also wish to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Korhola , and all the members of the European Parliament 's delegation to the conciliation committee
The Commission notes that the European Parliament seeks effective legislation and a strengthening of people 's right to high-quality environmental information
This legislation constitutes a significant part of the Community legislation required for the purposes of ratifying the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention
Mr President , I want to thank the rapporteur for having fought like a li@@ oness for access to environmental information
I believe , however , that in this case the worst was able to be prevented
On the other hand , regarding payments , we can be pleased that the principle of non-@@ char@@ ge@@ able information has been established
I do not know if a member of the public should be obliged to pay for the government doing what it is expected to do anyway
Finally , I would like to cite a case
I would just like to say that this directive is now being tested as regards whether we have a sufficiently broad definition for environmental information
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
I endorse Mrs Damião 's report and congratulate her warmly on her work
The asbestos tragedy is a typical incident and we should learn from it as much as we can
We knew a long time ago that serious danger was brewing
For economic reasons , we ignored this danger for a long time and , today , tens of thousands of victims are suffering and dying
Now we are attempting to protect ourselves
Tomorrow , however , those who refused to see what was before their eyes will have to justify themselves to their victims and provide them with compensation
In other words , when reason fails , we must invoke legal , or even criminal , liability
That is why I voted for the Damião report
I have today voted in favour of Mr Bourlanges 's report
I agree that the EU system must be simplified and that Parliament must contribute to the work of the Convention
I nonetheless regret the reference to management and labour
The rapporteur is trying to arrange for the introduction of an approval procedure by the Council and Parliament once management and labour have arrived at a proposal
In my view , that would give rise to an inappropriate third party in the social dialogue
The intention of the social dialogue is that management and labour should enter into binding agreements with one another
The Copenhagen summit was a very particular moment in the life of the European Union
I had the privilege of representing Parliament during that summit
I should say also that substantial terrain has been covered in the other work carried out by the presidency
In terms of the attendance of the presidency , this is the 3@@ 9@@ th debate in plenary at which the presidency will speak
I certainly want to say on behalf of Parliament to the Danish prime minister how grateful I am at the improved and substantial level of cooperation between our institutions
That was a great and positive experience
I left it with a strong and clear mandate to conclude the enlargement negotiations
I am delighted to be here today with an equally clear result
Following a long and difficult process , the Presidency concluded the negotiations with ten new Member States at the Copenhagen Summit
It is our common dream that is coming tru@@ e; it is our common aim that is being achieved
The European Parliament , the Commission and the Presidency have fought together for enlargement
The enlargement negotiations of the last sixth months have been like a long-distance race with a series of difficult hurdles that have had to be cleared along the way
Parliament , the Commission and the Presidency have stayed the course together , and in Copenhagen we passed the finishing line
I should like to express my thanks for all the efforts made and for the unfailing support and the help along the way
The decisions taken in Copenhagen closed one of the darkest and bloo@@ diest chapters in the history of Europe
We put an end to a century characterised by wars and conflicts
We finally said goodbye to the Europe of the Y@@ al@@ ta Conference and the Cold War
an era characterised by freedom , peace , growth and prosperity
The enlargement of the EU was the Danish Presidency 's main priority - but we have a large number of other considerable achievements under our belt
We have been a presidency that has set priorities , but not at the expense of other issues
This can be seen from our achievements
We have successfully continued the fight against international terrorism and re@@ doubled efforts against illegal immigration
We succeeded in reaching agreement on fully opening up the EU 's electricity and gas markets
We achieved a breakthrough in EU transport policy
The rules on the Single European Sky have secured the basis for fewer cancellations and shorter flight times , benefiting passengers , the environment and airlines
Together we have reacted swiftly and effectively to unexpected disasters
First there was the flooding in Central Europe
The EU showed solidarity by approving the establishment of a EUR 1 000 million Solidarity Fund for use in connection with natural disasters
Most recently , we reacted to the tragic loss of the oil tanker Prestige
Agreement has been reached on the emissions trading scheme in CO2
Progress has been made with regard to food safety , including on common rules for the labelling of food containing GMOs
We succeeded in finding a solution to the question of transit to and from Kaliningrad that is acceptable to all parties
the work on the codecision and budgetary procedures , amongst other things
For the first time in many years , we actually succeeded in reaching agreement on large parts of the budget as early as first reading
I shall now return to the Copenhagen Summit
These were intensive , difficult negotiations to the last
The ten new countries can become members from 1 May 2004
By then , both the new and the existing Member States will have completed their national ratification procedures
The first stage in this process - which in many of the countries will entail referendums - is the completion of the accession treaty
I shall call on all three institutions to do their utmost to keep to this timetable
The conclusions from the Copenhagen Summit also deal with the question of the participation of the new Member States in the institutions of the EU
We have laid down that the ten acceding states will be able to participate in the 2004 elections to the European Parliament as members
This provides a sensible framework for this fundamental issue
Here , too , I shall call for cooperation between the institutions to find flexible solutions that ensure the best terms for our new Member States
The issue of Turkey came to be one of the main topics in Copenhagen
We arrived at a balanced and realistic answer
We acknowledge the important steps that Turkey has taken towards meeting the Copenhagen criteria
We call upon Turkey to continue its reform process with vigour , and we pledge increased support from the EU to Turkey in these endeavours
This is the way it has to be
Turkey must be treated in the same way as all the other candidate countries
Then there is Cyprus
I would urge the parties to the conflict in the strongest terms to seize this unique opportunity to resolve this unfortunate conflict
We all stand to gain by finding a solution now , and none so much as the population of Cyprus
Enlargement will not result in the EU shutting itself in@@ ; on the contrary , the EU will strengthen links to its new neighbours
This will take place both within the framework of , and by means of the development of , the existing cooperation instruments
In addition , at the Copenhagen Summit , there was agreement on the frameworks for the future agreement between NATO and the EU on European Security and Defence Policy
I should like to mention by way of conclusion that the European Council also met with the Chairman of the European Convention , Mr Giscard d' Estaing
It was stated that the new Member States will participate fully in the Intergovernmental Conference
Bulgaria and Romania will take part as observers
Now that enlargement is home and dry , the work in the Convention has become the crucial task in European politics
We have enlarged the EU@@ ; we now have to ensure that the EU of the future , with more than 25 Member States , can also function effectively
We must simplify the decision-making procedures and stress the EU 's values
The Danish Presidency is now drawing to a close
We are passing the baton of the Presidency on to Greece , wishing them good luck and thanking them for the good troika cooperation
Finally , I wish to turn , once again , directly to the Members of this Parliament , and especially to the President , Mr Cox
The meeting of the President of Parliament with the European Council in Copenhagen was yet another constructive affirmation of the close relations between Parliament and the Council
The Danish Presidency has attached great importance to meeting the European Parliament with an out@@ stretched hand and the will to enter into constructive cooperation
It is with satisfaction that I have been able to note that Parliament has met us in the same positive spirit
We have had our differences , but the cooperation between us has been characterised by progress , results and a willingness to compromise
I have experienced this in this House , at our interinstitutional summits and at my meetings with the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament
This picture is echoed by Danish government ministers
I should like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for this constructive cooperation
The Copenhagen Summit also marked the beginning of a new era for the European Union
In Copenhagen , the EU carried out the greatest task in the history of the Community
The seed sown by the founding fathers of the European Union in Europe 's war-torn ground nearly 50 years ago has taken root
The enlargement of the EU has made their dream and their vision a reality
A new Europe is born
President Cox , Prime Minister , ladies and gentlemen , I stand before this House for the last time this year
A year that started with the successful launch of the euro and concludes with another giant step forward
I am not over@@ stating the case , however , when I say that the Copenhagen European Summit is a landmark in European integration
When I took office , I pledged that enlargement would be my Commission 's top priority
Some people might - and do - have the impression that the conclusion of the accession negotiations at Copenhagen was a formality
Nothing could be further from the truth
C@@ ourage and political will were required on all sides to achieve this result
I should like to single out the tremendous work done by the Danish Presidency
As the multiple negotiations went down to the wire , the Presidency maintained a steady hand at the helm and a cool head in a difficult situation
Prime Minister , this was a great personal achievement on your part
At the same time , this result is the fruit of our hard work too
Indeed , for over three years , 350 Commission officials and over 700 people in the Commission delegations have been patiently wea@@ ving the fabric of this silent tape@@ stry
I want to voice here my gratitude to G@@ ün@@ ter Verheugen , who has proved to be an astute , passionate negotiator
I would also like to thank Mr E@@ ne@@ ko Landaburu and all of the Directorate-General for Enlargement for their dedication and first-rate work
Although ten countries have completed the last lap , others still have some way to go
Romania and Bulgaria have been given detailed road maps to reach their target accession date of 2007
In December 2004 we have a date with Turkey to see if it meets the conditions for opening negotiations
These words echo the vision and generosity that marked the founding of our Union
The statement endorsed the Commission 's proposal to give Romania and Bulgaria more help in preparing for membership by raising their pre-accession aid by 20 %
I urge these countries to seize this chance to further speed up their preparations
This date will give Turkey time to push ahead with the reforms it needs to make to satisfy the Copenhagen criteria and implement them both in law and in practice
The Commission 's reports and recommendations will continue to be completely objective and impartial
Last week 's European Council achieved practically all its objectives
I say ' almost all ' because we came very close to achieving agreement on the Cyprus question
Despite the fervent efforts of the negotiators and the United Nations Secretary-General , we did not achieve a solution which we can consider to be definitive at Copenhagen
Nevertheless , both sides expressed willingness to continue with the negotiations and set themselves the goal of achieving an agreement by 28 February
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as Europe grows its responsibilities grow
Each enlargement brings us new neighbours which are drawn to the European Union as to a mag@@ net and some hope to become candidates themselves too
In my opinion , the countries of the western Balkans belong by definition in the European Union and this view was confirmed by the Copenhagen Council
The Stabilisation and Association Process is a powerful instrument and we must use it vigorously
The debate on where Europe 's borders lie is a debate about our identity
It must be conducted in this House and in the national parliaments and must involve all the European citizens closely
This search for the roots of our identity does not mean creating divisions
Indeed , European integration must provide benefits and new prospects for our neighbours as well , even if they are to remain just neighbours
We need to build a strong network of relations based on shared political and economic values with neighbouring countries , from Russia to the Mediterranean
This is the new strategic objective of my Commission
This proximity policy must bring our neighbours many of the benefits of membership without them having to join the Union formally in the foreseeable future
The European Economic Area is a useful model for such relations , but it needs to be enhanced by a series of measures to develop political cooperation
Our relations must be based on ' sharing everything but institutions '
Our proximity policy must be attractive , un@@ locking new prospects and bringing mutual benefits
It must motivate our partners to cooperate more closely with the Union and it must be dynamic and based on a structured , step-by-step approach
Ladies and gentlemen , we have successfully concluded the accession negotiations and we now have to make European unification a tangible , everyday reality
However , our biggest job in the coming months will be to inform and reassure our citizens in both the present Member States and the accession countries
The Commission will be mounting an extensive information campaign in which the Members of this House will play a crucial role
Indeed , just a few years ago , many of the candidate countries were governed by dictatorships
Many of their citizens fear they might be giving up their new-@@ found freedom and independence by joining another large bloc
There is concern in the current Member States , on the other hand , about the costs and implications of the entry of countries much poorer than themselves
Most of these fears are groundless
As G@@ ün@@ ter Verheugen has said , this is the best prepared enlargement in the history of the Union
We are all quite aware that the cost of enlargement is nothing compared with the cost of non-enlargement
We must therefore disseminate these simple truths throughout Europe and we must work together to make the citizens aware of them
The enlargement process has progressed thanks to tremendous determination , political courage and vision
I therefore warmly welcome the EU-@@ NATO agreement concluded at the Summit , which will enable us to conduct military peace-keeping operations in the Balkans from as early as next year
This is a further responsibility which we will have to , which we will be able to shoulder
The moment of truth , however , in the coming year will be institutional reform
We will not be able to make good our promises to our citizens unless we completely overhaul the Union 's structure
Only by strengthening the Union 's decision-making process can we build the more cohesive , united Union that will earn their respect and admiration
We must therefore all work together with Mr Giscard d' Estaing to make the Convention a success
This greater unity and determination must be reflected in our action on the world stage
Our growing responsibilities will leave no room for the vac@@ il@@ lation and inaction we have displayed in the past
Mr President , Prime Minister , ladies and gentlemen , there are therefore grounds for optimism
Lastly , President Cox , Prime Minister , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you and extend to you my very best wishes for the forthcoming festi@@ vities
I hope that you all enjoy a very well-@@ deserved , happy , peaceful break with your loved ones
Such success was not self-evident
As you are all aware , though , miracles do not happen by themselves
They require strong political will , great determination and also great skill
I would , though , also like to say that enlargement has not been the work of just a handful of people
It is simply not the case that the Community method does not work when great and weighty international issues are at stake
' What matters is that Europe should at last be able to breathe with both lungs '
That is the very point at which we have arrived
We never want to forget that the peoples of the Baltic countries never , ever , chose to join the Soviet Union
Neither did the peoples of Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic and Slovakia ever choose communist regimes for themselves
On the contrary , they established a democracy and a human rights movement under the most adverse of circumstances
We must not fear that we are being joined by Europeans with no understanding of democracy or of human rights
The many changes this enlargement will bring will not be merely internal
There will also be many outward changes , and we will gain additional responsibilities in our international role
I share the concern of those who say that we may not yet be adequately prepared to take on this important and great international role
Russia , the Ukraine , the states in the Caucasus , the Middle East - all of these are closing in on us
Our neighbourhood is becoming even more densely populated and is closer to our doorstep
President Prodi has talked about how we must shape policy in relation to it
Ladies and gentlemen , our work is not yet complete , neither at home nor in the candidate countries
The coming year will see the preparations for their accessions continued with energy and vigour
I believe that we have succeeded in coming to reliable arrangements , alleviating hardship and limiting risks
Over the coming year , the Commission , together with the presidency , will present the draft accession treaty to Parliament
We will then need Parliament to vote in favour of each individual state and of the treaty as a whole
It is Parliament that will be the first to decide whether we can travel to the very end of the road that was taken in Copenhagen
Parliament alone has the privilege of coming to a decision on every single accession treaty
No national parliament can do that
One might say that it is you who will be setting the benchmark for what twenty-five national parliaments will have to do in 2003
In 2004 , the EU will have 25 countries as members
Turkey has a definite chance of starting negotiations , the same chance that all the other candidate countries had , and of which they made determined use
I would like to emphatically underline Mr Fo@@ gh Rasmussen 's words to the effect that there is a definite sequence , which cannot be changed under any circumstances
The political conditions must first be complied with fully and unequivocally , and only then can a decision be made about whether to begin negotiations
The Commission will not shirk its responsibilities as regards the report and the recommendation
What is most important is that the recommendation that then has to be given should be based on the report 's conclusions
It will not happen the other way around
We will not have a political objective and already know what recommendation we will make , with the report then having to be framed accordingly
Instead , the report will be fair , objective and neutral
That is an opportunity for Turkey , and I also believe that Turkey is capable of meeting these requirements
It must now put all its energy into the work of completing reforms and putting them into actual practice
Ladies and gentlemen , the need for broad public debate has often been a topic of discussion in this House
It is now all the more necessary if the success of the ratification process is to be assured
Let us go into this debate with a cool head and objective arguments , but also with an enthusiasm for the Europe that is now coming into being
Mr President of the European Council , you spoke about a dream coming true , and we cannot but agree with you entirely
One major European newspaper has talked in terms of a terribly nice European family , and that is what Europe is like
Mr Prodi and Mr Verheugen , I would also , however , like to say a word of heartfelt thanks to the Commission
Rather than everything the Commission does being spectacular , every day is an effort
Let me make a comment on Turkey
We would greatly welcome it if Turkey were enabled to meet the political criteria by the autumn of 2004
We will be with them as they go down this road
Mr President of the European Council , let me make a final comment
Whilst this is not to diminish your work , we would have liked there also to have been a comment on Chechnya in the Copenhagen conclusions
With this in mind , it is my plea that we should respect human rights rather than gro@@ vel to anybody
This is a task for us all in the future
Congratulations on what you have done at Copenhagen
You can be proud of what you have achieved , and we have been happy to be your compan@@ ions on the road
You made a comparison , saying that the race you have run is a long-distance race
I believe that under the Danish Presidency this has been more like a race against time , or even a one-@@ leg@@ ged race , and you have won it
I believe you deserve special congratulations for that
I would reiterate President Prodi 's words , when he said that there is going to be an information campaign in which we must all participate
We are prepared to discuss the budget for this campaign immediately
I believe he has acted seriously , using his experience , in this process
The question is transition
You said , having taken decisions , that you are going to consult Parliament before the end of January
Are these consultations on consumer issues or is it an interinstitutional agreement ?
Many issues are currently under discussion
What will happen about Members of Parliament ?
We will need to discuss this , but the issue is whether there will be an agreement on this point
That is the key issue and that is the question that must be put clearly to our Turkish friends
I believe Europe has serious responsibilities at the present time with regard to the Middle East
I can tell you that there is disappointment and resentment in my country and a problem that extends to other parts of the Union
It is rare in my experience for a presidency to receive such wide praise from all sides of this House
The outcome of the summit is a tribute to the negotiating skills of Mr Fo@@ gh Rasmussen and the persistence both he and his team displayed
Europe can now reunite
The full application of the Copenhagen criteria , both in the new countries and in the existing Member States , must remain a matter of concern
Liberal Democrats would have preferred an earlier review of Turkey 's readiness for accession
An agreement on the United Nations plan to reunite Cyprus would have been the icing on the cake of the Copenhagen Council
Nonetheless , we remain optimistic that agreement can be reached so that a united Cyprus can sign the Accession Treaty in April 2004
We hope that Turkey will seize the opportunity to confirm its European vocation by putting pressure on Mr Denktash to reach a compromise
That was the agreement with Turkey to allow the EU 's Rapid Reaction Force to go ahead and have access to N@@ ato 's resources
Europe 's security and defence ambitions can now be put to the test as the EU takes over Operation Am@@ ber Fox in Macedonia
This may pave the way for more ambitious missions in the future , including peace-@@ enforcement operations in accordance with the UN Charter
We must be a bul@@ war@@ k for freedom and democracy and a force for justice
In building that strength , we owe much to Denmark
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , President of the Commission , there is no doubt whatsoever that the Copenhagen Summit marks an historic stage in European integration
I would like to thank the Danish Presidency for its active contribution
We must welcome the fact that , ultimately , nothing has compromised the conclusion of your work at this late stage
I , for my part , would be slightly more cautious
With regard to the peoples of the candidate countries , I do not think that we are all square
At the end of the long and tor@@ tuous negotiation process , some wounds still have not been heal@@ ed
This choice has , in my view , considerably strengthened the underlying feeling that the Fifteen view the countries of Central Europe as second-class members
Furthermore , the drastic safeguard clauses imposed on our partners have also added to the impression of unequal relations between a David and a Go@@ li@@ ath
In addition , by limiting themselves to a minimum financing level , which is still below 0
1 % of their annual GDP , the Fifteen have given the impression of opting , if you look beyond the words , for a cut-@@ price enlargement
Let us not forget that the ratification referendums are due to take place early in 2003
The Fifteen did indeed view the Stability and Growth Pact to be part of the acquis until Mr Prodi to some extent played down its relevance
The citizens of the candidate countries are not the only ones to be struck by doubt or uncertainty either
The citizens of the current Member States are too
That said , the enlargement process has been conducted without the citizens thus far
In this respect , too , we need initiatives
We must encourage every possible meeting between people of Eastern and Western Europe to discuss the challenges that they face and which stir them into action
Today 's news is dominated by the challenges facing society which , from safety at sea to migration , jeopardise the enlarged Europe
Otherwise , we will have no defence against a major incident which could undermine the civil@@ ising project that we all wish to succeed
Lastly , Mr President , this major enlargement has been described - outside this Chamber - as a revenge for Y@@ al@@ ta
I think it is wrong to embark upon this line of thinking
We cannot build anything sound or sustainable on revenge
This Col@@ d-@@ War approach is , I believe , completely outmoded
The unification of Europe must enable us to overcome all the tragedies of the twentieth century
We must now look confidently towards the future so that we can work together to enable a united Europe to enter the twenty-first century
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , pure self-@@ righ@@ te@@ ousness and self-satisfaction make me want to be a bit s@@ ar@@ c@@ astic
'@@ L@@ ads , you were wonderful
' Ladies , you were wonderful
Enlargement is upon us - doubtless a great achievement on the part of the Commission , the Council , the Danish Presidency and the presidencies that have gone before it
It is a certainty that the coming presidency will have to shoulder the additional burden of making enlargement a reality , and that will be difficult
We will then get back to talking about the financial framework
There is no point in enlarging something that is wrong
The only thing that makes sense is using enlargement to change what is wrong and , together , doing the right thing
' of course we will pay attention to the criteria '
What we demand of the Commission is that , within the next few months , they tell us what the criteria are to be
What , in fact , will we have to discuss with Turkey over the next two years ?
Will we be discussing the issue of women wearing the head@@ scar@@ f ?
Is that one of the Copenhagen criteria ?
Of course it is not; instead , we will be discussing fundamental issues of democracy and of how to make it a reality again
This is where we need a road map
Finally , I would like to say something about Iraq
I approve of what the Council has said
The UN Resolution can be interpreted in this way and that
It is not acceptable that compliance or non-compliance with the Resolution should be a matter for the Americans to decide on their own
We have to tell the Russians that , however friendly we are - and we are very close - certain things will not do
If , though , Mr Zak@@ a@@ yev can be granted political asylum in Europe , there must be something wrong in Chechnya
That is something that we in Europe never want to see again
If I am completely honest , I must also say that this was a job well done
This is an historic moment , and this point has been clearly made by previous speakers
I fully understand that Mr Wurtz does not wish us to make reference to a certain period of our recent history
The fact remains , however , that this sc@@ ar , this wound , on Europe 's body has now heal@@ ed
I would also draw Parliament 's attention to the risks that this would pose in the long run
Madam President , honour where honour is due
Mr Fo@@ gh Rasmussen has managed much better than the euro
The Danish Prime Minister and the Danish ambassador to the EU deserve praise for concluding the negotiations on time , but the result fore@@ bodes disaster
Never before have so many rich countries been so miserly towards so few
Most Polish farmers will be net contributors to the EU
They will pay more in contributions to the EU than they receive
On the other hand , the better-@@ off farmers will see a considerable increase in their capital , which future farmers will have to pay interest on
If Polish and Dutch farmers are given the same right to buy land from each other , one can hardly call this equality
The budgetary funds and the Structural Funds are also in need of revision
Subsidies to the rich countries must be eliminated
Give the new countries free membership instead of theoretical Structural Fund subsidies , which they cannot receive on account of our bureaucratic procedures and the co-financing requirement
Let us cut EU law down drastically from its 85 000 pages
Let us only require compliance with our standards in the applicant countries when they are exporting to us
Let us give them longer transitional periods , more leeway , greater freedom
Let us allow far greater flexibility than the negotiations have settled on
I am not criticising Mr Fo@@ gh Rasmussen for the result
In an EU that has 25 countries and more on the way , it is not possible to legislate as if it were a state
The EU should now focus on the cross-border aspects and let the parliaments of the Member States adopt the bulk of the legislation
An enlarged EU can only function as a Europe of democracies and diversities
We had this in mind when we named our group
Madam President , President-in-Office of the Council , President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the success of the Danish Presidency is , in my view , undeniable
That said , I hope that the Danish Presidency , that Mr Rasmussen and Mr Haarder will forgive me for pointing out two grey areas
The first is , as Mr Pasqua said , the ' reunion '
Unfortunately , the reunion is not complete and I thank Mr Prodi for having announced , for the Thessaloniki Summit , an initiative targeting the five Balkan countries
There is Moldavia too and Israel
I hope that the European Union will take particular initiatives in this area
The second grey area was touched upon by Mr Poettering and Mr Cohn-Bendit , namely Chechnya
I would like to thank the Danish Presidency and , through it , the competent Danish authorities for the position which was adopted during the Zak@@ a@@ yev affair
The Zak@@ a@@ yev affair has not been resolved , however
I would like to urge the Danish Presidency to take an initiative in this area
This would make it possible to prevent unjustified and unjustifiable pressure , such as that exerted on Denmark in the last few months by the Russian Federation
Madam President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Mr President of the Commission , I concur wholeheartedly with the congratulations that the Danish Presidency has received from all sides
I myself hardly believed that it would be possible to accomplish enlargement in the unbeliev@@ ably short time available , in the face of all the colossal problems associated with it
It is an impressive administrative and technical piece of work , which deserves the greatest credit
It was an impressive achievement , which was also due to the fact that the aims and priorities were clearly explained
We were told , ' Help us now , we are listening , we are working together ' , and the cooperation succeeded
It was an outstanding achievement
One of the great experiences for me was the meeting , here in Parliament , with the representatives of all the new countries
Of course , we all wish for these , and this is why we are carrying out enlargement
We desire peace , freedom , stability and respect for human rights , among other things
I should also like to say that it was impressive that the Kaliningrad problem was solved in the difficult circumstances that prevailed at the very time this took place
This , however , was another demonstration of our will , unity and cooperation playing the role that was needed to put this , too , in place
We shall be delighted to welcome the new Members to the European Parliament
Thank you to the Presidency of the Council and to the Commission for making this possible
Madam President , Winston Churchill once spoke of an iron curtain coming down over Europe
We have a lot to celebrate today
I think it is impossible to under-@@ estimate the importance of what has been achieved in Copenhagen
However , at the risk of being accused of putting a dam@@ pen@@ er on our celebrations , I must point out that we are not there yet
There is still a lot to be done
The candidate countries still have to meet our standards and they must not be allowed to slacken their efforts
We still have to get the process ratified by parliaments , including , in particular , by the European Parliament
We will scrutinise the treaties with care and attention to detail and no one should take Parliament 's vote for granted
We still have to sell enlargement to the people , both in the EU and in the candidate countries
We cannot take the people 's assent for granted
Notwithstanding Mr Rovsing 's remarks just now , we must still make the Kaliningrad solution work , and work in a way which does not undermine the sovereignty of Lithuania
We must still ensure that the financial arrangements actually work and we must also ensure that Parliament 's role in those financial arrangements is fully respected
We still have to reform our common agricultural policy before it bankrup@@ ts us financially and politically
A lot has been done , but there is still a lot to do
We must not lessen our efforts towards Bulgaria and Romania , nor must they assume that 2007 is a guaranteed date of accession
We must stop playing games with each other
Prime Minister , I am told by my government that in Copenhagen , you were always well briefed , determined , clever and gave real leadership
Madam President , the word ' historic ' has been used a very great deal in connection with the writ@@ e-@@ ups from Copenhagen
At last , the continent and its citizens are being united
The fact that the door was so clearly opened to Bulgaria and Romania was also historic , as was the signal given to Turkey
The EU is no Christian club
It is a union of values that defends democracy and human rights
Certainly , all summits are teamwork , but there are appalling examples of teamwork 's having cap@@ sized and of people almost having come to blows
When this has happened , it has been felt far beyond the closed negotiating chambers
There was undoubtedly a certain amount of drama in Copenhagen , but matters should never of course be too pre-@@ arranged from the start
In spite of this , and above all in spite of the concessions within agricultural policy , the Liberals hope that the reforms are here to stay
Everyone was prepared to compromise , but it is the Danes who must be credited with the outcome
Your objective , from Copenhagen to Copenhagen , has been crystal-clear all down the line
Despite the hesit@@ ancy on the part of certain people , you yourselves did not hesitate , Mr Rasmussen and Mr Haarder , but always sounded a clear note
While others dem@@ ur@@ red , like Ham@@ let wh@@ in@@ ge@@ ingly soli@@ lo@@ qu@@ ising ' to be or not to be ' at Elsinore , you had the path clearly marked out
Your efforts will go down in history
As a liberal , I am very proud that it is a liberal government that has brought about these events
Political victories can only be enjoyed for short periods , however
After Christmas , the work now begins again
The EU is to be reformed
Pow@@ er@@ ful leadership is needed , as well as the political courage to dare to implement a number of the institutional reforms required
The EU must become more effective , and that requires more majority decision-taking , especially within agricultural policy
The EU must become more democratic
A common constitution , common visions and common leadership are needed
Re@@ feren@@ dum@@ s must be held
We must all show that the new countries are welcome
They will be no B team but , rather , be as welcome as we ourselves are
There is therefore a heavy responsibility upon us all , including the Greek Presidency
Finally , we must also tackle the issue of how large the EU really can become
We eagerly await the Commission 's report on the strategy in relation to the countries that in future will border upon the EU
Madam President , thanks are indeed due for the great job that has been done
It seems to me that there is good reason to rejoice today , and I can indeed see happy faces around me
Mr Fo@@ gh Rasmussen is happy , Mr Haarder is happy , and Mr Prodi , we hope , is also happy
Mr Verheugen has every reason to be pleased with the great job he has done
The candidate countries should also be pleased with the tremendous job they have done
It would perhaps be better to entrust the Presidency to the small countries and let the large ones attend to the battles they are fighting elsewhere
This , however , is of course a little , humble wish for the future on the part of my country
At the moment , I do not think that there is any reason to
In my opinion it is not working , and I think that it is true that Mr Fo@@ gh Rasmussen has managed better than the euro
Enlargement has been a success , but we all know , of course , that things will not get any easier
Enlargement will not make it any easier to work in the European Union
There are many things that will become considerably more difficult , but it would have been worse if we had not prepared enlargement
This is the other side of the coin
For example , it will not become any easier to carry out agricultural reform , but it is even more necessary than before
I would of course urge both Denmark and the upcoming Presidency to take note of this
There is something quite wrong in the fact that life is better for a cow in the EU than for a farmer in a developing world country
We must make a start on this task , therefore
We must also make a start on looking at the EU 's global role
For what purposes do we mean to use our cooperation ?
Are we to let the USA determine everything in this world ?
Is it to be the USA that dictates the list of terrorist organisations , the policy on terrorism , anti-@@ missile shield strategy , Iraq , etc
Or will the EU find a counterweight to the dominance of the USA ?
What does the EU want when it comes to human rights ?
What will happen about the rights of the Roma when enlargement has fallen into place ?
It will not get any easier , but it is something we must follow up
It is a matter of keeping a constant eye on our own situation
What , too , will the EU do at global level as regards oppressed peoples ?
What will we do as regards Chechnya ?
Will we allow Russia to call the tune there ?
What will we do as regards the Iranians and their fight against the mul@@ lah regime ?
Will we let our policy there be determined by fe@@ ta cheese and oil , or will we really back our grand words up with action ?
There is much to tackle in the fu@@ ture; it will not get any easier , but we will get through it
After the men 's turn it is evidently the women 's turn
Ladies and gentlemen , please allow me to congratulate you on the result - although I do not have so much time that I can stand and e@@ ul@@ og@@ ise
Enlargement by ten new countries can now become a reality , as Mr Rasmussen has said , after fifty years of growth , prosperity and , in particular , peace
An excellent result , but will we now be able to deliver the goods for some 500 million people ?
Is this in fact possible ?
Will we be able to develop institutions that are democratic , transparent and efficient ?
We have not been particularly successful in doing so thus far , and we do not have much time in which to accomplish it
Mr Prodi said that integration must now become a reality , and I found that a particularly significant statement
Have you not , however , really underestimated the costs involved ?
Are the European institutions sufficiently credible ?
Not in our citizens ' eyes , according to the opinion polls
Should we not make more efforts in this regard ?
Or are we going to leave that all up to the Convention ?
The question of Turkey 's accession is first and foremost a matter for Turkey itself
Turkey must develop her democracy in such a way that the different peoples , including the Kurds , can feel at home there
Finally , we cannot view this question separately from the issue of how we view our borders
Do we really see the European Union - and I do mean the European Union - as sharing borders with Iran , Iraq and Syria ?
You will have to convince the public
You will also have to convince me because I do not believe that we are in a position to develop the institutions we would need for this ?
No one is fooled by the rec@@ an@@ tations surrounding Turkey 's candidacy
In my view , only the excessive consumption of e@@ au@@ -@@ de-@@ vi@@ e can explain such an outburst
Admittedly , it has to be said of Copenhagen that it was well organised , that excellent work was done , and that there was a marked improvement in transparency
Not all of the problems were resolved , however , although they were properly worked through
It is for this reason alone that I believe a debate on greater continuity is needed as a matter of urgency
The disadvantage is that when we really have some genuine praise to give , it does not come with the force that is deserved
For my part , Mr Rasmussen has been an outstanding President of the Council
I had said smallest but I obey the President 's e@@ dic@@ t on this
It is quite right that reference was made to the visionary words of Pope John Paul many years ago
I want to make some reference to Mar@@ g@@ are@@ t Thatcher 's own words at Bruges
These words have sadly become synonymous with euro@@ scepticism , but the real message that Mar@@ g@@ are@@ t Thatcher gave at Bruges was about a wider Europe
In those circumstances her message about Europe not becoming so in@@ war@@ d-@@ looking is one that has been carried forward by Mr Rasmussen and is one that we all celebrate today
I also endorse the remarks of Mr Verheugen
Sometimes we adopt too much of a patronising attitude towards these candidate countries
We have to recognise that both Parliament and peoples will need to ratify entry
I hope we learn the lesson of Nice
That is a message for all of us here
That is what the Convention is supposed to be all about
Mr President , I should first like to add my voice to the hear@@ ty congratulations to the Danish Presidency
I think that the Presidency and the Commission have done an outstanding job on enlargement
I think that this is a very good thing
The second thing that I should like to emphasise is the additional opportunity we have which is peculiar to our region of Europe
We now have a region surrounding the Baltic Sea which almost exclusively consists of Member States of the European Union
I believe that this presents some good opportunities , and we may have high expectations for the situation
Even if the end of the summit was perhaps somewhat mercenary - it often is - this cannot overshadow the big picture
Quite simply , we cannot pass a more secure , more democratic basis on to future generations than the strong community that has been created here
The other is to do with agriculture
The way in which the compromise on the budget was reached has perhaps not made it any easier to envisage the necessary , proper agricultural reform
We all know that the common agricultural policy , as it stands , is grotesque and is very detrimental to the developing countries
In my opinion , this really is a field in which there will be a need for political courage and responsibility in the future , too
I wish to close with a few words about Turkey
As you know , two things were made clear as far as Turkey is concerned , which in my opinion are very important
One of them is that it is a candidate country that can join on the same conditions as other candidate countries
This is a great opportunity for Turkey
the ball is in the court of the Turkish Government
It was , however , a prudent decision that was taken on Turkey last week in the European Council
I would like to congratulate the Danish presidency wholeheartedly on the completion of a difficult task
After all , the summit was not only historic , but also primarily financial in character
These negotiations are always the most difficult , and the accession countries obviously have an excellent understanding of what the European Union is about
I do wonder , however , to what extent the financial arrangements are s@@ cup@@ pering the political debate , specifically the arrangements with Poland and especially those relating to agricultural reforms
I wonder whether this would not be an appropriate time to stop and consider where we are actually going with Europe and how far we want to go
I found this to be a positive , confi@@ dence-@@ inspiring commit@@ ment; one which has unfortunately been paid far too little attention in the Council
I have a deep respect for the Danish Prime Minister 's leadership
He , the Danish Government and especially the civil servants have pursued the goal , and have achieved it
Everyone concerned is to be praised highly for this
The fa@@ ç@@ ade of the new EU house has been built and dec@@ or@@ ated; now it is a case of putting the furniture in place
The greatest task is without doubt reform of the common agriculture policy
I still believe that the EU should have reformed the system of subsidies to European farmers before the decision to enlarge the EU was taken
Madam President , I wish to welcome the European Council 's decision to organise the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference with 25 or even 27 Member States
We need results which are in line with our ambitions
I shall tackle two specific points
My second point relates to the conditions governing the entry into force of the future European Constitution
Madam President , I have mixed feelings about the Copenhagen Summit
I am pleased that we have taken the decision in favour of the EU 's predominantly eastward enlargement
This important decision once again underlines the fact that Europe 's post-war divisions are a thing of the past
It is now up to the Member States and accession countries to work together to create a realistic Europe
On the other hand , I regret the European Council 's reckless step in respect of Turkey
At the end of 2004 , the European Union will be under great pressure to declare that Ankara has met the democratic and constitutional accession requirements
Yet how does the Council envisage fitting the influential Turkish military apparatus into its own democratic framework in this very short space of time ?
Or will the precondition of ' institutional stability ' be the deciding factor in 2004 ?
If this is the case , my fear is that European constitutional requirements will become un@@ enforceable
I will also be very concerned about the future of the Christian minority in the former Asia Minor
Contrary to what some people are claiming , the fact is that the Turks have been given a date for final negotiations and in effect for accession in about 2007
The Copenhagen criteria are not prohibitive , and are actually not much harder for Turkey to comply with than , say , Romania or Bulgaria
Yet Turkey cannot be described as a European country - either culturally , geographically , historically , religiously , or politically
Prime Minister Rasmussen told the applicant countries what was what , if you will forgive the expression , but in a way they could accept
I do not , however , want to forget either the enormous contribution made by Commissioner Verheugen in the negotiations that led to the success of enlargement
Many sceptics along the way must have aroused justified anger in you
Per@@ severance , however , was rewarded with success , and I think Parliament should acknowledge that across the parties
Enlargement emphasises just how important our neighbours are
Russia has not become a new neighbour with enlargement , but an incomparably more important one none the less
The border will lengthen by hundreds of kilometres in 2004
When Romania and Bulgaria join in 2007 three countries still in a state of turmoil will be surrounded by the Union and Russia
These are Belarus , Ukraine and Moldavia
Nevertheless , the Union 's political focus should be firmly on Russia , and Russia should be helped , and even pres@@ sured , to introduce reforms
After that we can initiate private business interaction on a new level with the Russians and start investing in Russia
I am in full agreement with him on this matter
Let us leave high level foreign policy to the High Representative , wherever he or she has her home in the future
Another Commissioner could focus , for the sake of balance , on developing real content for cooperation in the Mediterranean region
the economy is growing
This is good for both Russia and the EU
Can the advantages of enlargement really be expressed in euros and cents ?
This enlargement will yield substantially more than can be communicated or depicted in sums of money
I want to quote an example
In 2001 , EUR 125 billion were spent on defence within the European Union , and as much as EUR 133 billion this year
There is nothing romantic about financial issues
You are of course aware that we , being the second arm of the budgetary authority , also have a part to play in all this
We will enter into a constructive and positive dialogue in order to deal with the relevant matters
We can take a positive approach to the initial evaluation of the Copenhagen financial resolutions
You have taken on board much of what we in this House had suggested
There is the mysterious category X , which sounds like something men@@ ac@@ ing out of the X@@ -@@ F@@ iles or some such science fiction
We have to have talks about this
This Parliament forms part of the budgetary authority
We will engage with you in a debate on these matters
We will also put the Budget under the micros@@ cope and examine it very carefully
We will monitor what can be expected of our present Member States and of the candidate countries
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Prime Minister , congratulations on the fab@@ ulous result that you , the Danish Government and the Danish civil service have produced
The result , a unified Europe , belongs to us all , but your good planning and political will were the decisive factors
Enlargement has finally put the Second World War to rest
Last Friday , in the Polish press room , this was very clear
Now it is justice that holds sway , and not br@@ ute force , among our 25 countries and in relation to the countries around us
The EU thus represents the most binding and only democratic cooperation between independent countries in the world
We should be proud of this , and so we are
This unique cooperation makes heavy demands on us , however
Our citizens expect the right results and solu@@ tions; we have to be able to take decisions and be effective
We must therefore focus on the essential points while at the same time preserving our diversity
this produces a willingness to compromise
The European Parliament must be an equal co-legislator , and , when the Council legisl@@ ates , we must all be able to follow the process
Justice , not br@@ ute force , holds sway in the EU
This is only possible if we have a strong Commission
An enlarged EU requires that we all uphold the values on which the Community is based
This was the message the summit sent out to Turkey
Turkey still has a lot to do and has to get back down to work
We politicians must be able to explain both sides of this fantastic European cooperation
you deserve to celebrate , and not just with a beer
I , too , would like to congratulate the Danish presidency , particularly as far as the decision on Turkey is concerned
Consideration of this will take time , and I think that it is right to look at precisely what has taken place by the end of 2004
Let there be no mis@@ understand@@ ing; it is now up to Turkey to act
The EU , however , must not sit on its hands
Where Turkey is concerned , it is no longer enough to simply refer to the Copenhagen political criteria , which are somewhat abstract
On the other hand , there is also no point in producing a whole stack of details without any form of prioritisation
Yes , this must change - lots of things must change - but what exactly does the European Union want to happen before negotiations begin ?
What must then happen while negotiations are in progress ?
Will the constitution have to be changed , for example ?
Will the National Security Council have to be abolished ?
These are all specific examples of areas in which the EU will have to be much , much more specific
Mr President , with the decision to welcome ten new members to the Union , the Copenhagen European Council has embarked upon a new era , that of Europe reunited
With the pre-@@ programmed decision to welcome Turkey , however , it has also decided to put an end to this era and perhaps to the Union itself
These Euro@@ pes did not exist back then
What was actually envisaged was nothing more than for Turkey to participate in the Europe of the single market
The peoples of Europe who do not want Turkey to join were deceived by the Copenhagen Council
The meeting of December 2004 was arranged with the usual cynicism in order to side-step the 2004 elections
This will probably not prevent the citizens from launching the debate themselves on this occasion
At this time , we should , however , also make some critical observations
For , if the newly-@@ acceding countries are to be enabled to absorb change , efforts must be stepped up to develop the necessary administrative capacities in these countries
This is in the interests of the European Union as a whole and of its capacity to act even with 25 members
The discussion in which we are engaged has , however , moved on to include Turkey and other countries
I am , though , especially glad that it has been decided that Turkey is to be dealt with using the Community method
I really do believe it to be an essential step forward that this has been made clear and that misunderstandings have been prevented
That is something we must have no part in@@ ; on the contrary , we have to remain within the boundaries
There is another section of the summit results which deserves our attention , namely that relating to the European security and defence policy
The European Council has made progress on three dossiers
For months , there had been no progress on the issue of the Union 's use of NATO capabilities and resources
this is a step forward that was needed
We also welcome the confirmation that the Union is prepared to replace the military operation in Macedonia as soon as possible
Lastly , the European Council also indicated that the Union was willing to carry out a military operation in Bosnia following on from SFOR 's activities
European ambitions are , admittedly , still modest in these three areas , but they at least constitute concrete steps forward
One final , brief point , on a less optimistic note , regarding the timetable of the Convention and the IGC on the future of Europe
Not only has the summit failed to give any clarification , it has in fact added to the confusion
This timetable is very important , however , for the success of the reform and for the European Parliament
The Swedish Presidency ended , of course , as a bloody police fiasco , while the Danish peace meeting may end up in the history books
Nonetheless , there is some justified criticism
Denmark has not succeeded in showing that the EU is a project for the people and not only for élites
No change has been made to the EU 's disastrous agricultural policy , which increases the fortunes of counts and barons but forces small farmers from Eastern Europe into bankruptcy
There has been no al@@ laying of the anxiety , felt in Estonia for example , that EU bureaucracy will crush the newly won right to self-determination
There has been no explanation of why Poland is forced to build a new Iron Curtain towards the east
Mr Titley , the Iron Curtain is not disappearing
There has been no understandable explanation of why freedom of movement should apply from day one to capital , but from a much later date to people
The enlargement process has thus again become a unilateral annex@@ ation whereby Brussels dictates and the candidate countries k@@ nuc@@ kle under
Denmark , which has its own exemptions , should understand that an enlarged EU cannot be uniform , because it then becomes totalitarian
Now , it is a question of ensuring that the referendums in the candidate countries are democratic
Above all , it is a question of ensuring that we do not decide about the EU 's constitution before the accession of the new countries
Denmark 's success at the Copenhagen Summit would then merely be the calm before the storm
This is a further warning to those in favour of Turkey 's accession , whom we would strongly urge to remember the Armenian holocaust which Copenhagen wrongly disregarded
Mr President , the Danish presidency has won admiration for the intelligent and principled way in which the summit was prepared and was made a success
In the disputes surrounding the financial arrangements , we have taken sound initiatives
In the discussions on Turkey , we were surprised by the highly original and appropriate formulations which placed responsibility for accession fairly and squarely on Turkey itself
A formulation that was even better than the final outcome
I must say that I was filled with pride by the star@@ ring role played by Bertel Haarder , who was formerly one of our colleagues in this House
Mr Verheugen can now indeed look back on the difficult task he has now largely brought to a successful end with a feeling of relief
Bulgaria and Romania still have some way to go , and they accept that
If they do not achieve the target of 2004 , I believe that they will do so by the 2009 elections
Turkey is a great deal more difficult
Up until the summit , Turkey gave us the impression that she was basing her accession to the European Union on sen@@ iority of membership applications
She is now suddenly asking a whole lot more , and that is the main issue here
Anyone who did not belong to the main population group of S@@ un@@ n@@ i Turkish speakers had a difficult time
That is ridiculous for a citizen of the European Union in an aspiring Member State
Things have only really been moving over the past two years
There is therefore still a very long way to go
Just as with Bulgaria and Romania , I would urge us not to be over-@@ optimistic as regards the speed at which Turkey can change
You only have to think of the special position of the army , for example , which Mr Lagendijk has already mentioned
This position cannot simply be changed by means of a few formalities
The system is too deep-rooted for that
If you take away a cornerstone , much more may come t@@ umbling down
I have great faith in what Mr Verheugen has said
This is unacceptable; in my view Turkey will have to demonstrate goodwill by putting an end to torture , the deliberate provocation of minorities and such@@ like
In the meantime we are looking forward to the participation of the observers from the first ten countries
Mr President , I wish , on behalf of my group , to make a number of short points on institutional questions that have arisen from the historic Copenhagen Summit
Firstly , the agreement that the new Commission should take office on 1 November
I welcome that agreement , but it must be clear - which it is - that the new Parliament must be the one to approve the new President and Commission
The details of this must be worked out , as Mr Barón Crespo said earlier , in an interinstitutional agreement between our institutions
I would like to see November become the permanent changeover date
It would be good to introduce this on a permanent basis and not just on this one-off occasion
Secondly , the issue of the signing of the new Treaty that emerges from the Convention , containing a constitution
It is fair enough that this has been set for May , when the new Member States will legally be members and can sign that new Treaty
However , I would not like to see the new date being used as an excuse for having a long , drawn-out IGC from autumn 2003 to May 2004
My third and final point is the question of the number of seats in this Parliament for Hungary and the Czech Republic
Under the Nice plans they are allocated two seats fewer than Belgium , Portugal and Greece - although those countries have a comparable population with Hungary and the Czech Republic
The Czech Republic and Hungary are right to ask for equality
It would be arrogance to attempt to sum up the Copenhagen Summit in two minutes
I will therefore limit myself to a few points
I would like to quote a statesman who lived two centuries ago in Italy - Coun@@ t Cam@@ illo Ben@@ so di C@@ av@@ our - who said
'@@ We have made Italy , now we must make Italians
We have certainly made Europe at Copenhagen - now we have to make Europeans
There has been a parallel achievement in southern Europe
It does not have the same material dimensions as eastern Europe , but it does have similar moral dimensions
This is what is important , Mr President , Mr President-in-Office , Mr President of the Commission , not the fact that no agreement was reached
But what you should really be looking at is the response in the hearts of the Turk@@ ish-@@ Cypriots , whose demonstrations show exactly what they think of their reactionary leaders
The subject of our work over recent days was a common vision for the future of our continent
Look at how much progress has been made over the last 50 years
Look at how many barriers have been torn down , how many misunderstandings have been overcome
Twenty-five - soon to be twenty-@@ seven - States are finally working together to achieve the objectives of freedom , democracy and responsibility
Such cooperation honours the fight that millions of our predecessors waged at the price of intense suffering and sacrifice
We still have a great deal of difficult ground to cover , no one has any illusions about this
The European Union must , in particular , respond to the need to make fundamental changes to the way it works and to its institutions
This is the work that the European Convention must bring to a successful conclusion under Mr Valéry Giscard d' Estaing
Mr President , although the Copenhagen decision is indeed of historical significance , this is only one stage in the development of the European Union
It has been said quite rightly today that enlargement of this Union must go ahead
An enlarged EU must , though , strike a new balance between flexible and efficient decision-making and the aspects of the decision-making structures that have to do with democratic policy-making
Mr Haarder has gone to a great deal of trouble to provide a number of contributions
Even though he is now the representative of a government and no longer a member of this House , a certain awareness may be at work here
The main thing , though , is that there are a number of governments that are far more restrictive than he wishes to be
I see that as highly problematic , as not enough governments have made public commitments to transparency and public access , especially as regards their decision-making structures
I hope , though , that the next conversations , which we will be having at the beginning of the Greek Presidency , will bring us a result
Mr President , the historic decision taken by the Copenhagen Council will doubtless help to restore the unity of Europe lost after the war
I do not have much time so I will make just two comments
Secondly , I should like to comment on the accession of Cyprus and , more particularly , the atmosphere surrounding the Copenhagen Council
We must now make every effort and do all we can to bring about the integration of the whole island within the next two months
I would also like to congratulate the Commission and Council teams that negotiated the accession of Cyprus
The European Council has therefore honoured the promise made at Helsinki to carry out accession , even in the absence of a political solution
Our hope of seeing a reunited island joining the Union has not materialised
Mr Denktash 's stalling policy could very soon turn out to be a threat to Turkey 's ambitions in Europe
The first topic that I wish to address is as follows
In November , with reference to the Brok Report , Parliament expressed its position with perfect clarity
How do we bridge the gap in time between monitoring the compliance with the criteria and the day when we actually discuss negotiations ?
What types of cooperation can we offer that are in both Turkey 's interests and our own ?
I think these considerations make 2003 a very important year
We all know that nothing came of that help until last Friday , the thir@@ teenth
On that day the outcome at Copenhagen paid off an old debt
The success of Copenhagen is success for everyone - including for this Parliament , which has been so intensively involved in this process
We can be proud of this result
To paraphrase the words of the great social democrat Willy Bran@@ dt , something that belongs together is now really being given the opportunity to grow more closely together
What started with Bran@@ dt 's historic genu@@ f@@ lection in that self-same Warsaw has now been completed in Copenhagen
Many of those who were leaders at the time have now disappeared from the political stage , but the outcome of Copenhagen is also a tribute to them
In this context I would like to pay particular tribute to Mr Verheugen 's efforts
The candidate countries are also deserving of praise
Their staying power has really been put to the test
As rapporteur for this Parliament for Slovakia , I myself have experienced the efforts made by the Slov@@ aks to meet the EU 's conditions at close hand
They were far-reaching , and there was very little time
The emphasis in the reports from the end of last week about the results of the Copenhagen Summit was on the financial arrangements for the negotiations and the Turkey question
Both aspects are important , but they are not the only weighty matters
Other problems also play a role in the European Parliament 's final assessment that we have to issue for each candidate country
Mr President , I , too , would like to congratulate Mr Rasmussen , Mr Haarder , Mr Prodi and Mr Verheugen on this excellent outcome
I would also like to join our group chairman , Mr Poettering , in emphasising that this small country has produced a great achievement
This really means that we will not have to change this rotation system in the future
Experience teaches us that big countries sometimes do not do things very well , and that small countries sometimes do things very well indeed
I say to Denmark that you can be proud of the outcome
Secondly I would like to make some comments on enlargement
I am delighted that Poland has made it to the first group of accession countries
This was of course not without problems
9 billion in the third year , we will know that despite enlargement we will still have money left over in 2006
We must therefore make it clearer that this enlargement is not expen@@ si@@ ve; in fact it is cheaper than all the enlargements that have gone before
Thirdly , I would like to mention Cyprus and Turkey
Actually I wonder whether Turkey ever ought to accede , as we will then have to tackle the debate about Europe 's borders at some stage
you had a visit from Mr Giscard d' Estaing , and I have the honour of being a member of the Convention
Mr Giscard d' Estaing once again spoke about the president of the European Union and the congress that would have to be set up
Those are his ideas
I can tell you that there is really very little support for this in the Convention
It is this European Parliament that needs more powers
That is also what it says in the Ben@@ elu@@ x statement
If all small countries endorse this , we will fortunately be able to consi@@ gn this nonsense of Mr Giscard d' Estaing 's to the scrap heap
I hope , therefore , that Denmark will back this
Mr President , the Danish presidency set itself an extremely ambitious agenda for the Copenhagen Summit
As a result , two fraught days were spent in Copenhagen negotiating a financial package , with divisions at one stage threatening to stall proceedings
However , once this had been resolved , the EU formally invited eight countries from Central and Eastern Europe , plus Cyprus and Malta , to join in 2004
This was a momentous occasion in European history , finally bringing to an end the divisions created by the Cold War
However , it must be said that enlargement is not yet complete
Negotiations have still to be concluded with Bulgaria and Romania and have yet to begin with Turkey
As a result of these momentous decisions , our new neighbours will be Ukraine , Belarus and Moldova
Now is the time to consider what sort of relationship we want to develop with these countries and how far we want it to go
It will now proceed in May 2004 , ironically under the Irish presidency and indeed , Mr President , during your final six months as President of this Parliament
I look forward to welcoming the new accession countries into the EU family on that historic occasion
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , the year that is coming to its end has been a remarkable one for Europe
The introduction of euro notes and coins has made the internal market a domestic one
This move also has knock-on effects on all the Member States and candidate countries , including my own country , which possessed the longest external - and dead - border
From Europe 's margin , we have moved back , to be - as the Austrian national anthem puts it - like a heart at its centre
Neither Copenhagen nor participation in the 2004 elections to Parliament bring the accession process to a conclusion
Information , communication and reform continue to be needed
The European projects call for the public to be more deeply involved , and not only prior to the ratification of treaties
Let me tell you , as an Austrian , that we give the utmost support to the proposal to be found in COREPER , because it is right and good
It is my expectation that a resolution will be passed at 3 p
this afternoon , or , failing that , at the extraordinary council of Transport Ministers on 31 December
Let us put an end to transitional arrange@@ ments; let us establish European rules and introduce the infrastructure costs directive in 2003 at the latest
The Presidency views the cooperation it has enjoyed with Parliament as constructive and positive , and we are delighted to see that Parliament shares this view
Mr President , I would like to ask Mr Verheugen to clarify something important
Commissioner , let us assume that both sides in Cyprus agree to a solution based on the Annan plan by 28 February
Provision has been made for a referendum to ask the people if they accept the plan and if they accept integration
If one side , let us say the Greek-@@ Cypriot side , rejects the referendum , what then ?
Do we revert to the Copenhagen arrangements , which only make provision for the integration of the Republic of Cyprus ?
The debate is closed
I have received six motions for resolution pursuant to Rule 5
The report states that establishing a European labour cost index would resolve a ' major weakness ' of the economic and monetary Union
If there is a major weakness then it has to be the salaries of the overwhelming majority of European workers
Do you want statistics ?
In that case , publish the index of profits made by the European ruling classes thanks to the exploitation of their workers
For the workers of Europe , it would be the exorbitant cost index of maintaining a capitalist system that is socially unjust , harmful to individuals and economically devastating
The EC Treaty specifies that the European System of Central Banks shall have price stability as its principal objective
So far , however , there has been no single instrument to record , transmit and evaluate labour costs , which constitute the most significant factor in price stability
The Common Position that is before us will close this gap
It is with satisfaction that I note that the rapporteur has given his approval to the Council draft , without tabling any new amendments
I regret that I am unable to share the rapporteur 's viewpoint
To protect themselves against this , the trade unions in many European countries have batt@@ led for years for inde@@ xing
Pres@@ sure from employers ' organisations and the support afforded by neo-liberal governments have in very many cases reversed this inde@@ xing
This can result in increasing intransigence in wage disputes
Attempts are repeatedly being made to place the blame for inflation or the lack of money for useful government expenditure on the shoulders of the workers
They do not consider the loss of domestic purchasing power that this can cause , or the excessive profits and too low taxes
The regulation on labour cost index will not eliminate this conflict of interests
The current proposal seeks to remedy that by establishing a common framework for the production , transmission and evaluation of comparable labour cost indic@@ es
In implementing the regulation , the Commission shall be assisted by the Statis@@ tical Programme Committee
The Commission will submit a report to Parliament and the Council every two years on the regulation 's implementation , including an assessment of the quality of the data supplied
In its Common Position , the Council has made a number of adjustments to the original Commission proposal
As in countless other cases , transparent and reliable information and the existence of clear and understood criteria these days constitute a crucial tool
These will help to guarantee the safety of passengers and the efficient management of these companies
In this context , I should also like to emphasise the importance that this set of regulations will have in helping to resolve the issue of air space saturation
It is hoped that the customs file identification database will make a positive contribution to the fight against organised crime in the EU
However , blood also indicates nobility , when it is blue , and we have to admit that the rapporteur , Mr Nisticò , is not lacking in nobility
It also means solidarity , for to give blood is to show solidarity
Therefore , with the greatest of pleasure , I voted for the report
Mr President , I would also like to welcome this report and the new directive
We should be thanking and congratulating all those millions of people in Britain and throughout Europe who give blood
We should also appeal to the 94 % of people who do not give blood to do so in future
On 12 June 2002 , Parliament adopted eight amendments at second reading
Under the written procedure , a compromise solution was reached and accepted by the Council , in conciliation , for donors to be examined by qualified health professionals
For all these reasons , this report has won my vote
We condemn the over-@@ scrupulous nature of the text , however , and particularly the lengthy timeframe given to manufacturers to apply this directive
Given that dangerous substances are involved , this lengthy timeframe , which only comes to an end on 1 July 2006 , is a licence to poison for manufacturers
Greater public information and participation will not only add legitimacy to the decisions taken by our institutions but will also enhance the quality of these decisions
The aim of this report is to facilitate public access to environmental information , so we cannot be anything but in favour
Transparency requires the veil of industrial and commercial secrecy to be lifted
the obligation for public authorities to actively assist citizens in their search for information , encouraging them to use the new technologies to answer their request@@ s;
quality standards designed to ensure that the information supplied is up-to-date , accurate and reli@@ able;
I therefore feel it is quite appropriate to strengthen the mechanisms for access to information and to information technologies
That concludes voting time
( The sitting was suspended at 12
and resumed at 3 p
The minutes from yesterday 's sitting have been distributed
Whatever the case , the situation is none the less cruel
The problem is that I asked about the Minutes and , although your contribution was not entirely irrelevant , it is the Minutes that plenary was supposed to be discussing
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on safety at sea and measures to alleviate the effects of the Prestige oil tanker disaster
Unfortunately it has happened again , however , and thus maritime safety and the prevention of oil slick disasters is back on the agenda
Following the Erika accident , the Council and Parliament adopted a number of measures to improve safety and reduce oil pollution at sea
On 21 November , Parliament made a strong statement on the Prestige accident
I should like to say to Mrs de Palacio that the Commission , in my opinion , has shown great energy in acting on this difficult matter
Both institutions deserve praise for the Community 's swift action in initiating decisions promoting maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment
We now have a starting point from which to proceed with the matter
It has been the Presidency 's intention to treat the Prestige accident extremely seriously
This was one of the reasons why there was a delay , meaning that the ministers did not end up d@@ ining with the Queen of Denmark
It was important to the Presidency that the meeting produce tangible results , and we can now say that it did indeed produce results
I am happy that the Council Conclusions are fully in line with the views of the European Parliament
It is my hope that Parliament will make an active contribution - and I am quite sure that it will - to the rapid achievement of the goals set
In particular , I am thinking of the measures that Parliament and the Council will be adopting together under the codecision procedure
These include accelerating the phasing-out of single-hull tankers
I have no doubt that we can agree on this , given the will and resolve that Parliament has shown in this matter
Today I must reiterate this
I would like to do so because we cannot allow a third disaster to take place
We cannot , following the Erika and the Prestige , allow another Erika or Prestige to sul@@ ly our coasts
These are the factors we need to promote
We have already seen the results of prolonged delays , paying more attention to certain problems
I do not deny that these problems existed but they prevented us from taking swift enough action
We cannot allow the tragic results of this to happen again along European coastlines
I refuse to believe that we in the European Union should be content with fewer laws and fewer powers than the citizens of the United States , for example
I repeat , therefore , that the European Union is not enough
We must also make progress at international level
Mr President , the Commission , and I shall end here , understands that there are various levels and timetables
We are now experiencing the impact of these coastlines destroyed by an oil slick , and having to deal with these people whose lives , homes and opportunities are affected
That is the issue we must address first of all
Although this must be our immediate concern , however , we also need to act immediately , urgently , to prevent any more disasters of this kind
I would like , by means of this and other measures , to further increase the security of our ports and our waters , internally and at international level
Mr President , this is not a natural disaster
This ecological , social and human disaster , however , requires us to mobilise all the financial means available to the European Union and also the recently created Solidarity Fund
It is true that we in Parliament are subject to the Rules of Procedure that all the groups approved , but the situation requires that we act generously and flexibly
I shall end , Mr President , by calling upon the Socialist Group in general , but more particularly my fellow Spanish Members
Two motions of censure have already been discussed against the government of the Par@@ ti@@ do Popular in Galicia , and the Galician Parliament has set up a committee of inquiry
Mr President , yet again this Parliament finds itself debating another maritime disaster
The parliamentary records are full of calls from this body for action on maritime safety
They have let the people of Galicia and all of us down on this issue of maritime safety
The Council of Ministers does not want a committee of inquiry , as there are probably too many skeletons in its cup@@ board for that
However , it is shocking that the PPE-DE Group opposes such a move
It is a clear snu@@ b to the people of Galicia
They seem to be more concerned about protecting political friends than protecting the people of Europe
This is the worst ecological disaster for years and the PPE-DE Group calls for a hearing - pathetic
The time for talking is over
no more blocking , delay , subsidiarity or hiding behind the IMO - action is what we demand
Commissioner , you are not the only one who is angry
When I see how this event is destroying the livelihoods of so many people and of a whole region , we are all angry
Here in Parliament we must do what a parliament must do , however , which is to make rules and reinforce existing rules
There is still a document being debated in the Council , Mr Haarder , and I hope that you will do something about this
We must also tighten up a number of things that are contained in Erika I and I@@ I@@ ; I am thinking in particular of ports of refuge and safe anch@@ or@@ ages
In order to prevent major catastrophes , we must make this system compulsory , so that ships that get into difficulties can get help there and are not turned away
We must draw up a rule for this
The Commission is supposed to be carrying out a study
We must also have a compensation rule for ports or places of refuge that take in ships
We must avoid this kind of thing in future
Secondly , I would like to comment on port state control , as mentioned by Mr Simpson
Let us tighten this up for hazardous ships
It is absolutely no use checking 25 % of ships in good condi@@ tion; you must focus the controls on hazardous ships and old ships
We must make sure that ships passing through sensitive shipping zones are better controlled
We ask that you enter into negotiations with third countries , including with Russia , with a view to possibly signing bilateral agreements in this regard
It is time to put an end to the quar@@ rels between the Council , the IMO and the Commission
The Commission must negotiate and must be given the opportunity to talk about this; then we will have much stricter rules
International legislation - and this is clearly stated in the resolution we all agree on - cannot be a reason to destroy the environment and people 's lives
The one must not take priority over the other
Finally , with regard to the debate on procedu@@ res; together with the Commission and the Council , we must act fast and get rules down on paper
We are therefore not in favour of a committee of enquiry , as this would take too long
Clearly if these decisions had been taken earlier , if the Prestige had had an accident , it would not have occurred in Community waters
The permissive attitude that allows flags of convenience to be entered in registers by the Member States is no more constructive , and there are other causes for concern
The most serious aspect of your government 's management in Galicia is that the State had no plans or instruments to address the crisis immediately
This comes as no surprise , Mr Galeote , when Mr Aznar supports the idea that we need to reduce State public services to a minimum
There is nothing more to do except think about compensating those affected until economic activity can be rebuilt
In order to do this , the Solidarity Fund and the Structural Funds need to be mobilised rapidly
Mr President , Mr Haarder has described the tragedy of the Prestige as scandalous
The Commissioner , Mrs de Palacio , has said it was an unnecessary incident which could have been avoided
This means that both the Presidency of the Council and the Commission and even Mr Galeote feel that there is blame to be apportioned
We condemn the fact that the Council has only adopted part of the Commission 's proposals
The European Union needs its own legislative framework because we are absolutely sure that the international community will not be able to produce adequate legislation
We feel that there are two supplementary measures which need to be taken in addition to those already adopted
Secondly , there must be new standards ensuring that dangerous substances are transported in smaller container ships than at present with a maximum capacity of 10 000 tonnes
Moreover , we must on no account disregard the fact that many Nature 2000 areas are affected by this disaster
At the moment , we are still in shock and this shock is at once good and bad for us
Our group also wishes to draw attention to a new raft of preventive measures
We have heard about preventive measures concerning the technical risks facing vessels or the way in which voy@@ ages are undertaken
We must also define mechanisms that can be made requirements at international level and which dis@@ qualify these operations , these so-called off-@@ shore maritime navigation operations
Mr President , all policy-makers must realise that our dependence on imported oil inevitably brings with it transportation risks
If we are to reduce this dependence , we will need to invest more in investigating the use of renewable energy sources
We should also be looking at the possibility of bringing in more oil in through pipelines
This does not , however , detract from the need to improve the general conditions for transporting oil by sea
Firstly , this means tightening up the present system of port state control
Secondly , the Council deserves support for its plans to speed up the phasing-out of single-hull tankers
It is , however , in everyone 's interest that we establish double-hull transportation capacity so as to avoid a shortage of supply
Thirdly , Member States must offer tangible help to ships and areas that are in distress
By no means all Member States appreciate the need to designate ports of refuge and create rescue , assistance and cleaning facilities in them
Furthermore , we must also press ahead with the setting up of the COPE fund , which will reimburse affected areas for the damage they have suffered
Incidentally , our attention should not be directed solely at the cargo but also at the bun@@ ker oil used as fuel for the ships themselves
This can also cause significant damage to the environment and has thus far not formed part of the remit of the IMO
Sadly , we have already experienced several major oil disasters
It is time we took a fundamental look at our position and our approach to these
I hope that everyone concerned realises this
Mr President , the European Union Member States agreed last summer that ships in distress should immediately be accommodated in a place of refuge
The Spanish Government , on the contrary , decided to tow the Prestige into open sea , regardless of the consequences
This week in the Spanish Parliament we witnessed the Spanish Government 's arrogance
For more than a month it has produced a day-to-day falsification of facts , failing to adjust itself to circumstances
Mr Aznar , as the main political authority responsible , has been totally unable to achieve a sense of reality
On the other hand , even if the Galic@@ ians have made little progress in their cruel work , they do not lose heart
Galic@@ ians are admirable
The disaster of the Prestige has become the disaster of José María Aznar and the ' prestige ' of the Galician people
The problem - and it is a huge problem - is that this legislation is not being applied , especially when it comes to port controls
Secondly , we must not forget that shipping goes beyond national and European borders
So action is needed at international level
Thirdly , we must not forget that there are numerous sides to this problem
There is a lot of talk , and rightly so , about old , single-hull tankers
However , nor is focusing on flags of convenience the only answer , because problems are frequently caused by ships not sailing under flags of convenience
Port controls are vitally important
The question of ports of refuge , maintenance of ships , all these questions need to be examined overall , globally , if we want results
So we need a package of measures to deal with the problem
As for the committee of inquiry , may I call on my honourable friends not to turn Parliament into a referee in order to resolve internal Spanish differences
Mr President , I said a month ago that this was a European disaster and requested a European response
Should we tough@@ en and change transport legislation ?
Should we re@@ prim@@ and ministers ?
They are the ones who are enduring this , and their cries for help have reached this Parliament , and we cannot deny this fact
The Galician , and therefore , European citizens need to feel supported in the long and difficult journey into which the negligence of their own ministers has thrown them
it is a European disaster and we do not want it to be repeated anywhere
We Galic@@ ians are strong
We always have been , we have always been able to fight against ad@@ versity and we shall not let ourselves be beaten by this disaster
We are not the ones who can answer this question , we compatriots , as Mr Galeote says
Com@@ patri@@ ots are not the same thing as accomplices , and we do not want to be accomplices
On the other hand , Mrs de Palacio , you should ask the Spanish Government a question
Nobody has been able to use and set in motion the abundant means available to Europe
I stress the need to speed up as fast as technologically possible the introduction of the obligation for oil tankers and other vessels with dangerous car@@ goes to be double-hulled
If we are actually to make a difference in this area , we need practical measures
I therefore propose that access to certain ports located in sensitive areas should be restricted without delay to double-hulled vessels
These areas should be progressively defined and de@@ limited at European level , with the introduction of similar measures to those currently in force , for instance , in Ven@@ ice harbour
Moreover , the capacity for demo@@ lition of old vessels , which is currently inadequate in northern Europe , in particular , must be enhanced with the provision of incentives
Are the Commission and the Council prepared to subordinate the economic considerations which thus far have been given priority to the demands of environmental protection ?
The Commission 's response would appear to bode well
I call upon the Council to be equally courageous
We must therefore determine the reasons for the current crisis , such as the persistence of the causes , the in@@ decision we have seen and the delay in transposing laws
The Council , as well as Mr Aznar , has shown contempt for the people of Galicia by having taken no rapid decision to help that region
It has shown contempt for the fact that Galicia suffers more disasters than any other part of the world
Ladies and gentlemen , our citizens are demanding that we put an end to this situation , starting with setting up a committee of inquiry
The Commission also quite rightly acknowledges that two elements , which are essential for guaranteeing safety at sea , do not fall within the competence of the Union
This is what France and Spain , which share borders with Portugal and Italy , decided to do
The success encountered in this area is a result of the lasting political will of the States concerned
There is also the question of liability
Mr President , Commissioner , I was particularly disappointed by the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit on the issues of safety at sea
What do the conclusions say ?
The European Council merely expresses regret and its grave concern at the consequences of the sinking of the Prestige and assures Galicia of its support
These statements are very revealing
Where are the concrete measures ?
Why do we still feel that the ministers are stalling ?
The Council reiterated its conclusions of December 2000 regarding the measures to take with regard to the Erika
How much progress has been made in implementing these measures ?
What is happening with port controls ?
What is being done to ensure the integrity of those who enforce these controls ?
How far have we come in banning flags of convenience ?
What is the status of the European list of ports that are likely to receive doomed ships ?
The Council must deliver an opinion on this as soon as possible
Lastly , what is being done to establish the responsibilities of owners and charte@@ rers ?
What we are waiting for is the Council to give us appropriate answers to these specific questions
How many more disasters must happen ?
On the other hand , I congratulate the Commission on its determination and I pledge the European Parliament 's support
A committee of enquiry , however , will not help , as we already have a legislative package and a committee would be a waste of our time
The political will of the Fifteen Member States is essential
We must work quickly instead of spending more time talking
If the directives adopted by this House had been supported , if the Commission had been supported , we would not be in this situation
Europe could have and should have prevented the Prestige disaster
Ladies and gentlemen , we do need to pass more legis@@ la@@ tion; what we must do , at long last , is to apply existing legislation
We do not need to have one debate after another
We must take action
Subsidies will not help to repair the environmental damage
The environment must be preserved
What use are our directives on protection ?
I would also point out that it is more profitable from an economic point of view to anticipate than to repair
Then the disastrous social consequences are so difficult to quantify
Mr President , Commissioner , the Erika is still lying at the bottom of the sea , off the coast of my home town
Europe 's work is dictated by one crisis after another
The Commission has worked well , but what are we going to do now ?
The only thing left to do is fill them up with petrol
Things just never change
We need to learn a lesson , so we will learn it
You will see - because this is not necessarily our last disaster - this request will become increasingly popular in coastal communities
The people will demand it and they will not understand why the seas remain in this state
This is the way Europe works
Since necessity is ultimately the mother of legislation , let us begin by adopting legislation where it is needed
Mr President , my heart goes out to the Galic@@ ians , and to the people who are clearing up the oil , which is now more than a metre thick
Unfortunately , however , we do not have an emergency response team , and we do not have a professional approach
We must , however , stop simply passing the buck
Naturally it is important to have this discussion , but not now , and not here
It is much more important to pay attention to making sure that Europe 's coastline is protected
My colleague Mr D@@ ir@@ k Sterckx 's specific suggestions about ports of refuge are particularly appropriate
I would like to call upon the Commission and Council to avoid ho@@ t-@@ air politics when it comes to the safety of shipping
I support the Commission in respect of the agency and the exercising of controls , as Mrs de Palacio has just mentioned
A ban on single-hull tankers carrying crude oil is so@@ ap@@ -@@ box politics and avoids the actual structural problems of international shipping
A well-@@ maintained single-hull tanker is safer than a badly maintained double-hull tanker
I am not a fan of the IMO , but it is absolutely necessary for coming to agreements and for honouring and implementing agreements that are already in place
It looks as if we are creating a more realistic policy than the one you are proposing
In my opinion it is important to negotiate with Russia on the control of ships that are loaded there and travel along the European coast to Africa
I hope that this will result in a better policy
Mr President , the Prestige has sunk and , once again , half-baked measures designed to prevent further oil slicks are urgently adopted
The main cause of these repeated disasters is the drastic reduction in sea transport costs , which have dropped by 30 % in 10 years
In short , bold political decisions are needed
Lastly , under the responsibility of the ILO , binding legislation must be drawn up that is applicable to all crews the world over
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , we must indeed do something , and we can go even further than what has already been agreed
I am therefore pleased that the two biggest groups here in Parliament support our proposals for a European coastguard and a European civil ' rapid reaction force '
The coastguard must be the strong arm of the agency for maritime safety
Secondly , the European civil protection intervention corps must be able to turn out immediately in an emergency and arrive with its own equipment
I have been told that big construction companies are now having to be called in
This is of course unacceptable
Prevention first , cure second , it was said here
The former , prevention , means we must not be distracted from the real culprits in this tragedy
We are dealing with a floating dump , with dangerous goods , with an opaque network of the interests of sou@@ l@@ less businessmen that we should un@@ t@@ angle and condemn
Must we investigate all these aspects ?
I hope and believe that this time the European Union has learnt its lesson
The European Commission has learnt its lesson
We must focus on repairing the damage that has been caused
Galicia cannot pay the physical price , in addition to the damage it is suffering
The real victim is the entire people of Galicia
Our responsibility now is to work together to achieve the maximum structural funds and the application of the Solidarity Fund@@ ; we are going to achieve it
I think this House would do well to agree to that today and tomorrow
Ar@@ ri@@ ving in Santiago de Com@@ post@@ el@@ a , one is aware that it marks the end of the W@@ ay of St James , with which the Commissioner will be familiar
The W@@ ay of St James is the route taken by pilgrims and sinners in order to do pen@@ ance for their sins
The sin recorded against their names is that of inadequate port State control
Mr Haarder , that was decided on a considerable time ago , but the Council has not yet set it up
absolute failure when it comes to a compensation fund for oil disasters
Parliament decided on this one and a half years ago , but until today the Council has had nothing to say on the subject
Mr Haarder , the Prestige sailed past Copenhagen
Let us remind ourselves of the route it took
Coming from Latvia , it passed through the Baltic , the Sk@@ ag@@ ger@@ ak , the Channel , the Bay of Biscay and past Galicia - it could have happened anywhere
In the Baltic , though , there are four candidate countries , which keep themselves well covered when it comes to safety at sea
Malta and Cyprus were always among the flags of convenience under critical discussion
This is where we need to make pilots mandatory
The Council and the Commission must bring pressure to bear on Russia in order to get a general requirement for pilots introduced via the IMO
This is one of the most dangerous places in Europe for traffic at sea
If it is our intention to withdraw single-hulled tankers from circulation , then we need more double-hulled tankers
Perhaps you could have a word with your fellow-@@ Commissioner Mr Monti about what we should do about future aid for Europe 's shipyards
Mr President , I would also like to express my support for all those who have been affected by this terrible disaster
Although we are able to welcome the proposals made by the Commission , the same does not apply to the decisions reached by the Council
I also regret , like other fellow Members , the fact that they are lacking in ambition
I am , however , also of the opinion that they are still inadequate
Prevention also means taking the swift and courageous decision to ban flags of convenience in the territorial waters of the Union
This disaster once again highlights the harmful consequences of liberalisation of the maritime industry , which has led to rules on safety and social welfare being compromised
Let me give you two examples
by virtue of which law is this to come about ?
We cannot make it Community law within the next couple of weeks
Can you quote me any national regulations that will put the Member States in any sort of position to implement the ban on single-hulled tankers ?
You see , Mr President-in-Office , passing fine resolutions is no use at all
I would like to refer back to Mr Sterckx , who wrote the report on ports of refuge
He is perfectly right , and here too , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , the same questions arise
Mr President-in-Office , how do you intend to make sure that the Member States do actually set up these ports of refuge so as to avoid greater calam@@ ities ?
It is the citizens that are hoping that Galicia will be given appropriate assistance by the EU
Europe 's citizens are demanding that legislation be made tougher , and that it enter into force and be implemented earlier than planned , without further ado
Protecting Europe 's maritime industry must increasingly be a common concern and therefore a common policy
Protecting the marine environment and the European coast are now major challenges for us all
As time passes , the true scale of this disaster is becoming ever clearer
I hope that the investigation requested by Parliament will be undertaken in a thorough and timely manner
What we need to do now , however , is to talk more about the future and this is why I would like to address four issues
Firstly , the European Union must provide funds to compensate , as much as possible , for the damage caused by the oil slick
In this context , I believe we would be justified in mobilising the EU Solidarity Fund , which has not yet been done
Unless this is resolved , we will be condemned not only to an oil slick but to a succession of oil slicks for months and years to come
To conclude , I wish to say that we want there to be a rigorous inquiry , as Parliament has already called for
What we do not want is for Parliament to be used to debate a country 's domestic problems
To know what has happen@@ ed; clearly we all want to know what has happened , but we are not going to achieve this through a parliamentary committee
Measures to be adop@@ ted; Spain has adopted measures
Coordin@@ ating 10 000 volunteers , coordinating the work of the institutions , coordinating international aid; what is coordinating all of this are the measures that have been adopted
Mob@@ il@@ ise the European institution@@ s; yesterday we had a meeting with Commissioner Barnier , during which he acknowledged the talks and contacts he had had with the Spanish Government
The fishermen are being paid , aid is arriving
Therefore , what are the justified grounds ?
You will find us helping the Galic@@ ians , you will find us helping the Spanish and saving these coasts
It then continues by expressing satisfaction with the Commission 's work in respect of the economic , social and environmental consequences of the loss of the Prestige
It also expresses satisfaction with the Commission 's intention to investigate the need for further specific measures , including in respect of liability and associated sanctions
What , then , was decided in the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism on 5-@@ 6 December ?
I would like to say to Mr Simpson that one of the issues is , of course , that of the parties responsible having to pay
There are two types of liability
There is also , however , the liability for environmental damage , of course
Mr Sterckx and others are right in saying that it is not the number of inspections which is crucial , but that inspection is carried out at the right points
It is a requirement that 25 % are to be inspec@@ ted; it is also correct that some countries are not meeting this requirement - and naturally that is wrong
The crucial thing , however , is that the right places be inspected and that they be inspected in the right way
Mrs Ramos was concerned by certain attacks on the Spanish Government
With regard to the issue of coast@@ guards and agencies , I would refer to sections 7 and 9 of the Transport Ministers ' resolution of 5-@@ 6 December
With regard to the imposition of liability , I would refer to section 18
hold the Council to the right declarations that have been made
That applies to the European Council , the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism and the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy
H@@ old the Council to the right things that have been decided
I wish Parliament luck with this and with providing inspiration to forthcoming presidencies in the years ahead
There are such vessels with more than 20 000 tonnes of oil or more than 30 000 tonnes of oil@@ -based products
There are 2@@ 58 of a lesser tonnage , with 10 000 , 20 000 and 30 000 tonnes approximately , which are also quantities which can cause enormous pollution
And this is the first issue we have to confront here
Secondly , the Erika I and Erika II packages must be implemented straight away
And what does this mean ?
And we must continue to make progress because , let us not beat about the bush , who is responsible here , who is responsible for the Erika ?
Firstly , we know very well , the shipowners , who have ships in bad condition
And this means making progress in the field of responsibility and preventing this whole chain of companies involved from evading responsibility
But this means action on an international level as well as on a European Union level
And this means , ladies and gentlemen , that the Commission must be a full member of the International Maritime Organisation in order to be able to promote its work
And we must make progress on the issue of flags of convenience
We must combat both types and I am also prepared to combat those which simply become tax havens
I would also like to say that we must continue to make progress on international maritime law
Because we must manage to strengthen , guarantee and safeguard all our coasts and those of our neighbours and make progress in the international field
The honourable Members say that there has been no progress at the Copenhagen European Council
Copenhagen has said the same thing , and I hope that this time it will be done
Ladies and gentlemen , it is too horrendous that after the Erika we are now talking about the Prestige
I am sure that this time the States of the Union will really honour what they have said
Amongst other things , the entry into force of the Erika I and Erika II packages , without waiting for 30 June 2003 or February 2004
I would like to point out , ladies and gentlemen , that this includes , for example , ports of refuge , which have until February 2004
I do not believe we can wait until February 2004
We have to get to work now and in January we are going to begin talking to the Member States in order to confront this
Let us make it very clear that a port of refuge is not just any port
A port of refuge must be a port with special facilities , easily accessible , so that a vessel with manoeuvring difficulties can access it during difficult storms
Because that is when accidents take place
This means equipping these ports in a special way , providing them with access which is particularly easy and suitable
Providing them with material and human resources and action plans which allow them to deal with emergency situations
Ladies and gentlemen , do not confuse a port of refuge with just any port , they are different things and this is a very complex issue
I would like to continue with the issue of funds , which the honourable Members have mentioned
Ladies and gentlemen , in the case of the Prestige I believe that European solidarity is clear
In the case of the Erika , do you know how much support and contribution to funds Europe has provided ?
a re@@ programming of EUR 10 million , of the Objective 2 funds , which Brittany benefited from
In the case of the Prestige , it is true that the disaster is even greater
5 % of the amount for disasters , no more , but it is a European solidarity effort in any case
We are also talking about re@@ programming the Cohesion Funds or Structural Funds allocated to Spain or to Galicia
50 000 tonnes of fuel oil in two wrecks which , unfortunately , are still lea@@ king oil
Because naturally what we cannot tolerate is that these two sub@@ merged sections of hull should continue giving out and expanding the oil slick
We must provide a solution
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , coast@@ guards have been mentioned
To conclude these Council and Commission statements , I have received 7 motions for resolutions presented in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure
Mr President , I feel that Mr Galeote has made personal comments about me , in my capacity as President of the Spanish Socialists in this House
I would ask him to withdraw his fal@@ sities and sl@@ urs
I really do not understand Mr Galeote
I do not understand why Mr Galeote is determined to turn a European debate into a Spanish debate
However , Mr Galeote , from one Spaniard to another , I will define what I think of your attitude by means of two traditional sa@@ y@@ ings
Mrs Díez , you felt that personal comments were made about you and the Presidency has given you the floor
Mr President , a saying is a saying
In no way have I tried to call Mr Galeote a thi@@ ef
everybody believes that others are like them
He has accused us of dishonest conduct , which has never been the case , and he knows that there has been dishonest conduct in his ranks
The Presidency is grateful for this clarification , Mrs Díez , which rest@@ ores our sense of parliamentary courtesy
Mrs Díez , you have taken the floor for your personal statement and so has Mr Galeote
What we cannot do is allow an interminable chain of personal statements
Let us consider this issue closed
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Thursday at 11
The next item is the joint debate on
In Seville , specific priorities were devised along with deadlines for adoption of the individual legal acts
We have not simply met these dead@@ lin@@ es; we have gone even further
The implementation of the Seville conclusions has been a task of the Danish Presidency
This applies also to the issue of combating illegal immigration and administering the external borders
Seven@@ teen different projects and initiatives have been implemented with a view to strengthening border controls at both sea and land borders and at airports
In addition , a general dispatch programme and a specific plan for the return to Afghanistan have been adopted
These two were approved a couple of weeks ago
With regard to asylum policy , substantial progress has been made in respect of implementation of the Treaty of Amsterdam objectives and the priorities set in Seville
Further progress has been made on the area of asylum under the Danish Presidency
There is now agreement in the Council on the Dublin II regulation , which is expected finally to be adopted
This was the particular task to be achieved under the Danish Presidency
This task has been achiev@@ ed; there is political unanimity
The Commission 's proposal for minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers is similarly expected to be adopted at the Council meeting tomorrow
Substantial progress has been made , and there is now political unanimity on the definition of a refugee and political unanimity on the definition of subsidiary protection
This unanimity is based on the Geneva Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights
We have achieved political unanimity on virtually all of Articles 1-@@ 19 concerning the basic terms used in refugee law
The things on which agreement has been reached are some of the difficult things
Moreover , there is a big difference between having conventions and having directives
This proposal , too , will be adopted by the end of 2003
As regards the proposal on long-term residence status , on 15 October 2002 the Council discussed a number of outstanding political issues
The Council will work towards meeting the deadline laid down in Seville for adoption of the proposal
Parliament has been consulted in all these cases , and Parliament 's statements have been incorporated , or will be incorporated , into the basis for the Council 's decision
The Council considers it very important that Parliament be involved in this area , to which the codecision procedure does not yet apply
The Council looks forward to even closer cooperation with Parliament in the area of asylum following the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice
I hope that I have , in this way , given you a comprehensive status report as regards the results achieved within the area of asylum and immigration policy
I believe that , overall , it conve@@ ys a positive picture
I agree that matters have proceeded too slowly
I know that the Commissioner felt this too , as indeed I myself did , when I sat on the relevant committee here in Parliament
It is important that the deadlines are met
This progress was due to the personal engagement and knowledge of Mr Haarder , whom I praise for that
In fact , the Dublin II regulation is expected to be formally adopted in the Justice and Home Affairs Council tomorrow
Together with the start of operation of the Eurodac system , which is scheduled for 15 January 2003 , this will constitute a positive step forward
I am fairly optimistic about the discussions in the Council on the directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers in Member States
I share the President-in-Office 's view that it is possible for the Council to have this directive adopted tomorrow
Thanks to the adoption of this legislation , the first phase of the common European asylum system is progressively taking shape
Two main elements of the system are still to be adopted
Little remains to be done on this key proposal which could be adopted by the Council at its first meeting in 2003
I also expect the Council to speed up the examination of our amended proposal on asylum procedures , which we presented six months ago
In such sensitive policy areas , the strategy of small steps will prove to be efficient and win the confidence of our citizens
As you know - and as already mentioned by the President-in-Office - the directives on family reunification and long-term residence status are still under examination
I encourage the incoming Greek presidency to finalise these negotiations as soon as possible
It is possible to have them adopted during the first half of next year
Urgent progress is needed on these two texts , which are key elements for an active EU immigration policy
In this document we also elaborate on the possibilities , but also the limitations , of the Community budget in this area
This programme complements other Community cooperation and development instruments
The degree of harmonisation attained or currently being negotiated has often failed to meet the Commission 's expectations
However , the harmonisation being attained is worth our effort
Nevertheless , this first attempt at building a policy has also taught us a few lessons
This policy is still encum@@ bered by too many institutional and legal constraints , as the President-in-Office was commenting in his remarks on conventions
Codecision should become the norm and general provisions should allow the Commission to formulate a fully harmonised policy
The objective should not be simply the achievement of minimum standards but a fully common asylum system
Unanimity in the Council - especially in view of an enlarged Union - appears more and more to be an invitation to stalemate
Therefore , I am very pleased with the constructive conclusions reached by the Bru@@ ton report within the framework of the Convention
They point in the right direction as to the future of European policy on asylum and migration
I am sure that those conclusions will receive the full endorsement of the European Parliament
Mr President , we have spoken much in recent weeks about the enlargement of the European Union
That enlargement extends our borders to Russia , to Ukraine and Belarus - it is hardly surprising if issues of border control and immigration policy are centre stage
But when it comes to immigration , no country is an island
A real debate is needed at European level , and not the kind of dis@@ ta@@ ste@@ ful slog@@ ane@@ ering that we suffered at the Seville European Council
As a policy issue , immigration is simple
Unless we open our markets to goods from poorer countries , thus helping their people to prosper , we will take their people
And unless we set our own immigration policy , either anarchy will reign or - more worryingly - criminal gangs of human traffickers will set that policy for us
I congratulate Commissioner Vitorino on the proposals that he brought forward a couple of years ago at the beginning of this whole debate
I deeply regret that Member States did not adopt them as proposed
The debate has been dominated by the repressive aspects of migration policy and has shown scant regard for its humanitarian aspects
The strategy has hardly been one of small steps as the Commissioners suggested - one of ' faltering feet ' is perhaps a better description
I had the honour of chairing the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs in this House for the first two years of that discussion
Well , exhortations to pro@@ creation have never been known to work
The evidence suggests that the higher our living standards become , the less people will want to have children
So for economic reasons too , we need a mature debate about a policy of managed migration
I hope that this afternoon 's debate will contribute to achieving some joined-up thinking on immigration policy
I have been asked to report on the readmission agreement with Hong Kong
I deplore the fact that did not happen , all the more so because this is the first readmission agreement negotiated by the Community
In the case of future agreements , I ask that Parliament be kept informed about the state of negotiations by the Commission and the Council
Re@@ admission is about the return of persons found ir@@ regularly on our territory
Few in this House would deny the need for a policy of return
It is an integral part of any credible immigration policy
Effective return safeguards the integrity of asylum policies and of regular immigration programmes and it acts as a deterrent to irregular migration
Re@@ turn has risen to prominence essentially because of the way in which our over-@@ stretched asylum systems are being used as alternatives to a close@@ d-@@ door immigration policy
The advantage of assisted voluntary return is that it permits return in a non-@@ punitive and a cost-effective way
It has been shown to work in Germany , in the United Kingdom , in the Netherlands and in Belgium
It is more convenient and it is less costly , both financially and politically , than deportation
It has been almost exclusively a European phenomenon and we need more research on the sustainability of return under A@@ V@@ R programmes
But our policy needs to be rational , driven not by prejudice , but by a sober assessment of our needs
It must be carried out by governments who ought to resist the temptation sometimes to de@@ port in order to seek approval from the mo@@ b
That policy must also address gender and health issues which are vital in this debate
The readmission agreement on which I have been asked to report is the first readmission agreement that the Community is entering into
I share the Commissioner 's appreciation of the willingness of the Hong Kong authorities to negotiate this with us
Some may argue that Hong Kong is not a safe country
Nor have I any doubt that the Hong Kong administration is competent to administer a readmission agreement
Moreover the agreement itself refers to international commitments to the protection of vulnerable persons
However , what concerns me about this agreement is that it is the first in what will be a series of such agreements
Au@@ thor@@ isation has already been given for the negotiation of such agreements with many countries - some of them have even been initialled
The fact is that some of those agreements will be far harder than this one
Therefore , I would ask the Commission this afternoon to clarify a number of issues
The first concerns the scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by the Member States , the categories of people involved and their countries of origin
Are the measures that Member States have adopted adequate and effective ?
Is the Commission sure that the readmission agreements it is proposing are compatible with our obligations under international refugee law ?
Will the Commission commit itself to establishing joint monitoring mechanisms with the countries with which we make readmission agreements ?
The House would like answers to all these questions
I would also like to know why the European Parliament is never mentioned in the Commission 's communication on a Community return policy
I would like clarification as to which coherent and transparent financial instrument will be used for the return policy in question and readmission agreements in particular
The human rights clause in the readmission agreement used for Hong Kong is not strong enough to protect us against all eventualities in such agreements with other countries
That is why I welcome the Commission 's recent communication on integrating migration issues into the Union 's external relations policy
I am happy to see that has carried on and followed the evolution of these issues
Com@@ men@@ cing with Hong Kong , we welcome this first ever European Community readmission agreement with a third country or territory
As far as this concrete agreement is concerned , we have adopted a balanced approach
I recognise that we should have kept Parliament better informed regarding these negotiations
In my defence , the only thing I can say is that there was only one round of negotiations
It would have been difficult to inform Parliament in the middle of the talks
Nevertheless , we take seriously the fact that we will now negotiate several readmission agreements
We need to introduce practical ways of consulting Parliament and keeping Parliament informed
I hope that I will be here next time to discuss readmission agreements with you and that I will then have a better story to tell you
As far as the oral question is concerned , the Commission does not have exact figures concerning the overall scale of voluntary and forced repatriation promoted by Member States
I can tell you that an average of 40 % of the money allocated to Member States in the European Fund for Refugees is used to finance voluntary return
Only voluntary return comes under the provisions of the Fund for European Refugees
I recognise that we need to have more accurate statistics on these issues
For instance , I cannot distinguish between voluntary returns and forced returns because national Member States ' statistics do not make the distinction
With regard to enforcement of decisions to return people , the Commission has no responsibilities so far as enforcement is concerned
That is exclusively the responsibility of the Member States
Nevertheless , we believe that some instruments should be adopted at European level
For instance , mutual recognition of expulsion decisions is a key element
I recognise that the Commission does not have any instrument for monitoring post-@@ return situations
It is not within our remit and we do not have the tools to make such an evaluation
Of course , I welcome the idea of having a broad debate on return policy
As you know , we have published a Green Paper , we have presented an action plan and the Council has endorsed this action plan
I am looking forward to hearing Parliament 's view on this subject
Mr President , asylum policy is particularly difficult , and has many unpleasant aspects
One major aspect is the fact that a large proportion of asylum seekers are ultimately faced with the prospect of return - or even forced return
This is something that always attracts a great deal of attention and arouses emotions amongst the general public
We do have to take account of the often highly contradictory emotions of the general public
The number of people who have been organised to return voluntarily to their own country or to their former country is relatively low
The whole of our asylum policy - or at the very least our return policy - must meet the requirements of human dignity in all respects
It goes without saying , however , that these should include other aspects than just the return clauses
Such cases naturally occur in all countries
As far as the Hong Kong agreement is concerned , I wholeheartedly endorse what Mr Watson says about it
It is of course a pity that we are being asked for approval at this very late stage
Its legitimacy naturally depends on our approval
We are therefore justifying this approval now
As far as the clarity of European policy is concerned , Mr Haarder has already spoken about this
I think that it is very important , particularly from the point of view of human dignity in respect of third countries
Finally I have a question about the European Fund for Refugees that was mentioned
None of them have been adopted
At the European Council in Seville , without having done its homework in this field , the Council once again established priorities and time limits in relation to immigration policy
They began to talk there less about this policy and more about the fight against illegal immigration
But we have not made much progress on that either
In any event , what did happen there was to begin to talk about this in a different way which gives me some concern
They began to talk about the return of immigrants , the control of external borders , in a way in which there is not much room for many concrete proposals
On the speed problem , there has been a spur@@ t on asylum policy under the Danish presidency
I too pay tribute to the energy of Mr Haarder
However , on the question of balance , I still feel very frustrated that legal migration and rights of migrants have been neglected
Let us take , for example , the reception conditions directive which highlights the classic danger of the ' lowest common denominator ' approach imposed by the unanimity rule
This is not Mr Haarder 's fault
After apparent agreement on the text last April , debate was reopened
S@@ pi@@ ed on by teen@@ age boys , women are marched to hospital and forced to undergo abusive gy@@ na@@ ecological examinations to prove their cha@@ sti@@ ty
They still have to wear the bur@@ k@@ ha , which is medieval
I suggest that we cannot guarantee the security of women returned to Afghanistan
I would like assurance that we are not returning women to Afghanistan
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I think that what has been said on this subject is very important
Furthermore , I wholeheartedly support the comments made by my fellow Member , Mrs Terrón i Cusí
We would have imposed sanctions on them to force them to take back their nationals
There is another issue that concerns me as well , Commissioner , that of the ' brain drain ' affecting the countries of the South
Today , as we know , nobody objects to admitting young IT professionals
Nobody objects to hiring young students either
However , when it comes to the question of the immigration of regular and regulated flows , we will no longer accept anyone
We fall back into the trap of these old fan@@ ta@@ sies or , quite simply , of meaningless phrases such as zero immigration or ' wide-@@ open ' borders
In seeing people come to our countries and fall into the hands of sl@@ um land@@ lords we clearly find the great liberal ideal which drives some of us
I shall conclude by also saying that I am shocked to see that the majority of immigration policies are dealt with by the Home Affairs Ministers
I think that this issue must be a part of a co-development policy , since it does not stop at sanctions
We know that , today , the UK army can turn people away and we know that there are refugee camps in France
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the readmission agreements that the Council is proposing stem more from a strategy for combating illegal immigration than from genuine cooperation
Allow me to stress two points
With regard to the readmission clauses , the Union reaffirmed its commitment to the Geneva and Dublin Conventions at the Tampere Summit
What criteria are applied in order to verify that a country to which a national is being returned is safe ?
The European Union is basing its policy on respect for fundamental rights
This applies , in particular , to the measures which regulate the movement of individuals , and especially to the measures relating to voluntary or forced return
How does the Commission intend to verify that these rights are respected in case of return , particularly when it is a question of mass returns ?
These issues are real issues
Today , Afghans may be returned to Afghanistan despite the fact that there is no guarantee of their safety and of peace in the region
The closure of Sangatte has provided no solution to the problem of accepting refuge@@ es; Kurds and Iraqis continue to arrive every day
What common control mechanisms does the Commission intend to put in place with the countries with which these agreements are negotiated ?
We should like to have been reassured that these fundamental rights are being respected
In spite of the quality of the work of our rapporteur , we have no guarantee regarding these questions that are fundamental for our freedoms and our rights
The readmission clauses provide a response to the concerns regarding the interests of the countries of the Union instead of assisting the development of third countries
They are harmful to any Community immigration and asylum policy; we are therefore unable to support them
Excluding population pressure , political instability and regional war , it is clear that the main pressure stems from economic disparities
In short , the bulk of immigrants seeking access to the European Union Member States are economic migrants
Therefore , any successful policy must deal with not only the exclusion issues but also the causes of migration
Here it seems clear the European Union is making things worse
Virtually all its external policies in respect of third countries and its policies towards the candidate countries seem geared to causing migration from less-@@ developed countries
The Union has rigid quotas , tariffs and other protectionist policies restricting trade with third countries
In terms of fishing agreements , the Union pill@@ ages third-world waters , instead of encouraging local industries
It also takes skilled , educated workers from these countries , depriving them of the building blocks of economic development
All of this cruelly exposes the imperialism of the European project
Instead of getting on with practical issues , you launch upon idealistic common policies
These policies are making the problems worse
It would make far more sense to stop damaging third-country economies , rather than embarking on these extraordinary new ventures
In other words , leave immigration control to the Member States - a policy that my party supports - and address the failures of existing policies
There it seems to me , in deference to the Council member present , you must try harder
This danger is now present within Europe
I will refer firstly to immigration
We therefore need a coherent European policy which takes account of all the elements inherent to the phenomenon of migration
The European Councils in Tampere , Laeken and Seville have represented a significant advance in the field of immigration
Nevertheless , I would like to stress the importance of other aspects still awaiting substantial progress
This is a task which , in order to be successful , must be carried out in close cooperation with the third countries bordering the European Union
I would therefore appeal to you to rationalise the European process , and let us not get tied up in vicious circles which are highly influenced by national interests
As many people have already said , the common asylum and immigration policy is progressing in a very unbalanced way
Where repressive measures , including combating illegal immigration , are concerned , the Council has once again done a lot of energetic work this year
The Council has opted for a highly unilateral approach
It has put control of our external borders and sanctions against offering assistance to those entering and staying illegally right at the top of the agenda
The removal and return policy has now been added to this as a priority
In this context we are talking today about the readmission agreement with third countries , in this case Hong Kong
Parliament was more or less left standing on the sidelines during the negotiations for this agreement , and has not been able to act in accordance with its allotted role
This should not have been allowed to happen , particularly as this agreement will be a model for future agreements of a similar kind
I have taken note of Mr Vitorino 's promise that this will not happen again , and I intend to remind him of this
My group can otherwise live with the content of the Hong Kong agreement , but we do endorse Mr Watson 's critical approach
Le@@ ading on from his questions , I would like to make the three following comments
Mr President , Denmark and Mr Haarder have today received well deserved praise
I agree with that praise
However , I am less satisfied with the EU 's refugee and immigration policy
The proposals are more often than not about control and repression
The global perspective is easily lost
Well , that poverty in the world be combated and that we obtain more aid , more trade and more democracy
Mr Haarder is well aware of this
We need a humane asylum policy based on respect and human dignity
All human beings are entitled to seek asylum within the EU
The fact that the EU needs a common asylum policy is shown by the Danish example
When Denmark tigh@@ tens up its policy , the refugees come to Sweden
A humanitarian EU must be able to do better
That requires codecision making in this Chamber , something of which Mr Haarder is more aware than anyone else
I also agree with the words of Mrs Terrón i Cus@@ i , who said that a global approach to these issues is needed
And on this point I wish to say that I do not agree with those who oppose repressive measures on the grounds that they are not necessary
Illegal immigration and our inability to control migratory flows allow people to react in exagger@@ atedly xenophobic , racist and intolerant ways
It would probably be easier to make everything that is illegal legal , but we cannot do this
Not everyone who wishes to enter EU territory can do so
And therefore , as Mr Watson said , we must have a policy of repatriation that ensures the credibility of our immigration policy
And this is crucial and must be done without any comple@@ xes of an ideological or any other nature
What we have , therefore , is a lack of speed and a lack of balance
As the Commission itself points out , more than 90 % of the world 's immigrants live and work outside the European Union , close to their countries of origin
Development cooperation is not an instrument for resolving the internal problems of the donors of aid , but a tool for fighting poverty
The origins of migration , whether legal or not , lie in poverty , political repression and armed conflicts
These are the causes which must be combated through development cooperation , rather than using it to repress their effects
Article 13 of the Cotonou Agreement on readmission led to problems and protests
I agree with you on this point and I hope that you will work towards this goal
Mr President , Parliament today appears to have become aware of the problems related to mass , illegal immigration that Europe has been experiencing for 30 years
It is high time to realise that the sacrosanct principle of laissez-faire and lais@@ se@@ z-@@ pass@@ er spells disaster for Europe
The Sangatte refugee camp has closed , that is all very well
The United Kingdom has agreed to admit one thousand illegal immigrants , but then what ?
What about all the others , those who were not tag@@ ged by the Red Cross , and what about the hundreds of immigrants who arrive illegally every day ?
C@@ losing Sangatte without closing borders is obviously inconsistent , absurd and ineffective
With regard to the second point , the success of an immigration policy undoubtedly depends on the integration measures which must accompany it
I am happy to support the measures of the Danish Presidency with regard to readmission agreements
Another important point is the creation of an integrated system of management of external borders
Until now , the proposed measures have mainly been focused on the question of illegal immigration
After the Tampere Summit in October 1999 , however , the Commission approached the task with a positive outlook
We believe that it is impossible to discuss combating illegal immigration unless we also consider proper procedures for immigration and the conditions for integrating foreigners
We need a global approach , this has been pointed out
It is not a fortress Europe that we want
We feel that the two parallel decisions are utterly disproportionate
How many Chinese nationals are able to enter the European Union thanks to the visa exemption and stay here illegally ?
And how many can be returned to Hong Kong - at our expense , I might add - under the readmission agreement ?
We therefore feel that this agreement is , in all respects , not at all beneficial
We would very much like to know how many of these concessions might have been negotiated
In any case , it is unacceptable
At present , that is what we have to deal with in this area in the European Union , and on a daily basis
I believe that my fellow German Members who are taking no part whatsoever in this debate have good reasons for their absence
That , I believe , is what the Christian Democrats should finally ask themselves - they should ask themselves what they think they are doing
If they were to act responsibly , they would inevitably end up sharing with us a concern that there should be a common asylum and immigration policy
We believe that it is possible to respect human rights while pursuing a proper policy of combating illegal immigration
Of course , as other members have also pointed out , immigration policy means more than just guarding borders
It means more than repressive measures , repatriation and readmission
It also means recognising the human rights and fundamental employment and civil rights of immigrants and what they have to offer and can contribute to the development of Europe
It means fully recognising the rights of anyone who has resid@@ ed in the European Union for five years , as we have repeatedly proposed here in Parliament
I did not entirely understand this remark , because I was after all able to say that we have just reached agreement on the cornerstones of a common asylum policy
In addition , we have also agreed to convert the Dublin convention into a Dublin directive
I believe it is extremely satisfactory than we now have agreement on these cornerstones of a common asylum policy
Mr Vitorino and I met for the first time in the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs
He was the chairman and I was a member
The first thing we talked about was these things , which we wanted to lead to a common policy , and we talked a lot about Eurodac
When will it come to something , we asked the Commissioner
something will come of it on 15 January , that is , next month
So I think we have achieved a great deal
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to repeat that
Similar efforts are in progress in other countries
Most governments maintain that this must be a national decision
This is why it has also been difficult to arrive at common rules on the right to free movement between countries
We will probably make some progress , but as I have mentioned , it is not that easy
To reassure her I can state that the Afghans in most countries - this is true in my country at least - are young men from the Kabul region
For this aspect of the matter must be included
Finally , I would say to Mr Olle Schmidt that I thank him for his interest in Danish legislation
It already meets all the common minimum rules that we are talking about , and even goes beyond them
Regarding , for example , the policy on return , we have financial instruments for voluntary return , which is the European Refugee Fund
We have also recently presented a proposal for the use of heading B7-6@@ 67
Admittedly , a policy for the management of migratory flows must include , by definition , the existence of financial instruments for forced return
In this respect , I shall respond to Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and say that the Commission has no executive responsibilities in the area of return
All Member States , in applying decisions on return , are meant to respect the relevant international instruments on fundamental rights , including the non-@@ ref@@ ou@@ lement clause
There are also legal instruments for judicial protection where the Member State breaches the rule on non-@@ ref@@ ou@@ lement
All readmission agreements must respect the Geneva Convention as well as the principle of non-@@ ref@@ ou@@ lement
I also support Mr Watson 's approach in that we must emphasise the dimension of fundamental rights within the framework of the re-admission agreements
As far as the relationship between the development policy and the immigration policy is concerned , let us be clear and speak openly and honestly
It is true that the development policy deals with the profound causes of immigration , but the development policy can only bring about long-term changes in this area
It would be impossible to expect immediate effects from a sustainable development policy of the kind that we apply in our relations with third countries
It is this whole complex framework that we are trying to lay down in the Immigration and Development communication
I hope that we shall have the opportunity to discuss it here at a plenary sitting of the European Parliament
Lastly , I am wholly of the opinion that we must provide special protection for minors
The communication relates to the interaction between the policy on managing migration and social policy in general , and the European employment policy in particular
It will be an important time for clarifying the close relationship between the management of migratory flows and employment policy at European level , as Mr Watson highlighted so clearly
Mr Berthu has the floor for a point of order
Mr President , I put a specific question to the Council and the Commission , but I have not been given an answer
Could I have a precise answer to this question ?
Un@@ usually , we are going to give the floor once again to Mr Vitorino
I shall give a very brief answer to Mr Berthu
The agreements were certainly not signed at the same time
The decision on the list of visas was taken two years ago
The decision relating to the re-admission agreement has just been signed today
Furthermore , statistics show that the number of illegal immigrants originating from Hong Kong is really very minimal in all the Member States
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow from 11 am
The next item is Questions to the Council
That is our limit
All questions which there is no time to answer , in accordance with the Rules of Procedure , will be replied to in writing
As you will understand , it is beyond my personal capacities to resolve this problem in any other way
We will therefore begin the Questions without wasting any more time
The sign read B@@ AI@@ O@@ NA@@ K@@ O G@@ EL@@ TO@@ K@@ IA , which simply means Bay@@ on@@ ne railway station
Mr President , thank you for drawing attention to what this question is about
I frequently have a bad conscience about answering questions that no one has heard
As you mentioned , however , it is about the fact that French authorities have removed a sign in the Basque language which points the way to a railway station
does this not contravene the Charter of Fundamental Rights ?
The answer is that the Charter addresses the EU authorities and the national authorities when they administer EU policy
And this is not only an inter-@@ State objective , but also a European Community objective
Mr President , that was precisely what I was trying to say
I have the greatest sympathy for regional languages
, it is talking about the Union 's policies and not about the Member States ' policies
The Council was asked what measures the Council would take after 16 Spaniards were expelled from the northern part of Cyprus
I can answer that the Council has not been informed of the event in question
The Council , which met on 24 and 25 October , was pleased to see the significant steps that Turkey has taken towards meeting the political criteria from Copenhagen
And the Council established that the country has made progress with regard to the economic criteria and adaptation to current Community law
The Copenhagen European Council on Friday once again called upon Turkey energetically to continue its process of reform and urged Turkey to take further practical steps
As part of the accession partnership Turkey has undertaken fully to support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General at finding a solution to the Cyprus problem
I agree with the opinions expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council
With this in mind , I would ask the President-in-Office of the Council to answer the question
Following the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 14-@@ 15 October , the Council Conclusions on the integration of third-country nationals were approved
These Conclusions encouraged active participation of third-country nationals in community life and emphasised how integration measures are a key element in developing a common EU immigration and asylum policy
Does not the failure to deliver legal rights make the supportive statements appear hollow and ins@@ inc@@ ere ?
The issue of the integration of third-country nationals is one of the priorities of the programme of work of the Danish Presidency
Its importance and the need to prompt and encourage integration were recognised and underlined by the Council in the conclusions adopted on 14 - 15 October
Using these contact points , we will exchange best practice and learn from each other 's successes and fi@@ as@@ co@@ s
I would add that a major conference on integration was held in Copenhagen in July , which also provided opportunity for such exchange of experience and best practice
This will contribute to integration but , as I said during the debate that we have just concluded , it is not that easy to reach agreement concerning these conditions
There is no doubt as to the aim , however
When I tabled this question two months ago I did not know that , coinci@@ dentally , there would be a debate this afternoon on immigration and asylum
I would like to thank the President-in-Office for that reply
However , we still do not have this directive
What kind of timetable is there to get this directive agreed ?
It will give the estimated 20 million people who are legally long-term residents in the European Union the legal framework of rights and obligations that will help to integrate them
Is it not ludicrous to keep calling for mobility of labour to boost economic growth while preventing those 20 million from going to work in another Member State ?
They are a rather obvious category of people who might be inclined to do that
Is there a timetable , is there a target date for getting this directive agreed ?
Mr President , I am afraid there is no such target date
We could easily arrange one if we were prepared to accept a bad directive , but , if we want a good directive , we need more time
The Commission 's proposal on a common patent system has been the subject of debate and negotiation in Parliament as well as talks between Member States ' governments
Con@@ currently with these negotiations , the London Agreement is being implemented under the European Patent Convention
For companies which make large numbers of patent applications , the present situation is creating uncertainty as to what rules will apply in the long term
What is the timetable for the introduction of a common EC patent ?
What steps have been taken to bring the negotiations to a successful conclusion during the current presidency ?
Which aspects of the Commission 's proposal are causing most controversy in the negotiations ?
Since the Commission tabled its proposal concerning EU patents in August 2000 , the Presidency has made a significant effort to promote the work on this proposal
In recent months , the work has been concentrated on the patent system 's cour@@ t-related aspects
Its starting point has been a working document submitted by the Commission in August
In spite of the lack of progress , the efforts have continued
Against the background of an overall political agreement , the aim is to have the matter of the EC patent finalised and adopted as quickly as possible
It is absolutely crucial , so I want to thank Mr Sjöstedt for his question
We must get this matter finalised
I wish to thank the Council of Ministers for its answer
I also want to express my thanks for the work that has been done in this important area
My question concerns the remaining problems , as mentioned by the President-in-Office of the Council
These relate partly to the court system and partly to a number of other areas , for example the languages in which the work is to be done
The proposals made by the Chairman of the Convention , Valéry Giscard d' Estaing , concerning the name of the European Union
The Chairman of the Convention , Valéry Giscard d' Estaing , is making the surprising proposal that the universally accepted name of the European Union be changed , e
Was this amongst the issues agreed on by the Laeken European Council when drawing up guidelines for the constitutional reform of the Treaties ?
Has the European Council made any suggestion of this kind to the Chairman of the Convention ?
What view does the Danish Presidency take of this ?
Is it not a baff@@ ling suggestion that the significance and role of the European Parliament should be reduced by a Constitution based on this draft ?
Does the Presidency of the Council agree that a Constitution along the proposed lines would be a clear expression of a new intergovernmentalism ?
The Council is carefully following the work of the Convention and is of course aware of the structure for a constitution , presented by Mr Giscard d' Estaing in October
As is well known , it will be the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference that will adopt a final position on the issues raised by the two MEPs
It is rather difficult for me here and now to predict what the Intergovernmental Conference will say
I also believe that , as matters develop , the Convention will go a very long way towards finding a solution acceptable to all the governments
That solution will , on the other hand , be less ambitious than some might have wished
I believe , however , that it will be viable and also be able to survive an Intergovernmental Conference
Mr President , I wish first of all to express my surprise at the question asked by the President-in-Office of the Council
Its name must be the European Union then , a name that is furthermore clearly pleasing to the ear and appropriate
Is this a desire on his part to play a leading ro@@ le; van@@ ity ?
Could this be a sign that the Chairman of the European Convention is attempting to reduce the Union 's political power ?
Can you give us a straight answer , Mr President , as to what you really think about this ?
The Presidency does not share responsibility for the proposals tabled by Mr Giscard d' Estaing
He is perfectly entitled to table them , but the Presidency has no comments to make , either on its own , or on the Council 's , behalf
In any case , Mr Haarder was himself once a Member of this House and can surely understand the extent to which that would reduce Parliament 's role
I shall simply answer your question , Mr Martin
Does the Council also adopt that line of reasoning etc ?
Is that the Council 's view ?
The Council has no view
Nor should it have , either , for we have left it to the Convention to prepare all these things
I must not therefore , on behalf of the Council , stand here and evaluate the proposals that are made in the Convention
I am certain that many here in the Chamber , including Mr Duff , would explode with rage if I did that
When did the High Representative for the CFSP last visit the island of Cyprus , and when is he next planning to go there ?
What contact does Mr Solana have with the authorities in Northern Cyprus ?
What is his current assessment of the security situation on the island ?
Funding for the northern part of Cyprus
Does the Council have specific priority areas which it will take into account when setting up this programme ?
Will it make provision for specific control mechanisms in respect of this funding and , if so , how ?
In the event that a political settlement between the two sides fails to materialise , will the funding still be made available ?
I am able to state that Mr Solana has not visited Cyprus since he took office
He has had a wide range of contacts with many of the actors involved and has taken every opportunity to call for a constructive solution
No practical priorities have yet been set or more specific provisions laid down
Would the minister agree that it is fear for their security that is proving the principle obstacle to Turkish Cypriot compliance with the Annan proposals ?
Mr President , just as I have the greatest respect for the engagement that the honourable Member has shown in the Cyprus issue , I can certainly follow his reasoning
I must just underline that the Cyprus negotiations take place under the auspices of the UN and not under the auspices of the EU
There is a perfect relationship between the UN and the EU
If the UN were to ask the EU , via Mr Solana , to work with it towards a solution , we in the EU would do so immediately
Mr Solana would go to Cyprus straightaway
There is , however , a division of labour and I think we should keep it as long as this is the wish of Kofi Annan
Will enlargement have a negative impact on the least-favoured regions ?
The needs of producers living in the disadvantaged regions of the present European Union should be safeguarded
The financial consequences of enlargement were reported on in the Presidency 's conclusions arising from last Friday 's European Council summit in Copenhagen
I would therefore refer you to the conclusions of the summit , showing the economic situation throughout the period
Please tell me which agreement or conclusion speaks of equity or redistribution
Copenhagen speaks exclusively of limitations
Enlargement is very good , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , but the numbers do not add up
It is unacceptable that most of the cost of enlargement is expected to be paid by those whose income is below the Community average
The financial framework decided in Berlin is clearly insufficient to deal with the costs of enlargement and the greater economic and social cohesion needs
Please give me a full answer , as is the Council 's responsibility , and tell me who is going to pay this bill between 2006 and 2013
As the author is not present , Questions Nos 10 and 11 lapse
When will the European Parliament , and the Member States ' parliaments , be consulted about the arrangements which are currently being negotiated secretly ?
There is really no secret about the fact that negotiations are being conducted between the EU and the United States on cooperation in criminal matters
It is on this basis that the Presidency conducted negotiations
On 28 November 2002 , the Council was informed of how far the negotiations concerning a draft had progressed , and due note was taken of this
It will do so even though Article 24 of the Treaty on European Union does not oblige the Council to consult Parliament
With regard to the national parliaments , it is , in accordance with the latter 's own rules , the Member States ' task to inform or consult them
That is all I can say at the present time
The principle is real exposure
I have a suspicion that the President-in-Office is personally in favour of transparency
It is quite normal for governments to communicate with each other and if they agree on something that involves the parliaments this will be referred to the parliaments
In accordance with the scheduled programme and the time available , we are going to put a final question to Mr Haarder
Weapons used in Afghanistan
However , it is clear that guided bombs made of very high density metal were used to destroy Taliban command centres
If this high density metal is not uranium , what is it ?
As far as the Council knows , there is no ammunition of the type referred to in the question and produced in Europe that contains depleted uranium
Various types of special steel and/or tun@@ g@@ st@@ en including w@@ ol@@ fra@@ m are used for remo@@ te-@@ controlled missiles , but not depleted uranium
According to information provided by armed troops on duty during the war in Afghanistan last year , depleted uranium munitions or weapons were not used
It seems to me that you have given a cautious response
I can only repeat that , as far as the Council knows , no ammunition of the type concerned , containing depleted uranium , is produced in Europe
Nuclear safety is a topic of deep concern to us all
The Commission has now drawn up a proposal in the form of a Green Paper
Now it is the Council 's turn to do something
There are many different suggestions as to how this directive is to be dealt with in the future
Do you believe that it is still possible to implement this directive before the new Member States join ?
That is unfortunately outside the scope of the question I have made preparations for answering , so I cannot provide any answer
As the time allotted to questions to the Council has elapsed , Questions Nos 14 to 36 will be replied to in writing
As you will all be aware , you can tell a good sportsman by the way he wins , but a great one by the way he loses
Despite sport 's essential social role , ladies and gentlemen , there is no policy on it at Community level
We have therefore been campaigning in this House for a number of years already , for the legal basis for this to be enshrined in the Treaties
It is admittedly not being called the Year of Sport , but , for many understandable reasons , the ' Year of Education through Sport 2004 '
There is consensus in this House as regards the Year 's seven objectives
Ladies and gentlemen , the Council has accepted the essential points of the report passed by this House at First Reading stage
What is important is that it has confirmed the amount of funding involved , the EUR 11
5 million that the Commission believes to be sufficient to complete in this Year those things that it has in mind to do
If everyone now plays their part - and that includes the media - then this Year can be of truly great significance for sport
I very much hope that the trend towards the decreasing importance of school sport can be turned round
By means of this Year , we want to build up networks and give an impetus to cross-border cooperation
What we do not want is for the small amount of money to be spent on even more interminable research projects
Research is always in progress , and that is not what this Year is for
That would be a fitting climax for the Year of Education through Sport
What , ladies and gentlemen , is all this about ?
It is our intention to establish a platform for educational measures in sport above and beyond frontiers , institutions of state education and organisations
The Community projects instrument will receive 80 % support , and those things done at national level alone will receive 50 % co-financing
This seems to me to be very well suited to putting this Year 's European dimension centre-@@ stage
Parliament should deliver the opinion required of it as soon as possible
As there are no objections to this proposal , that is how we shall proceed
I would even go so far as to say that it is almost a historic moment for the young people of our countries
Indeed , you are about to adopt the decision to make 2004 the European Year of Education through Sport
This is the first time that such a large-scale initiative has been launched at Community level in the field of sport , particularly one focusing on its educational value
Today , therefore , the decision that you are about to adopt with your vote is good news for the worlds of education and sport
It is also the form@@ alisation of the astute work carried out together by Parliament , the Commission and the Council
All this means that everything is now in order and we can therefore move on and start the practical work , for the discussions have progressed quickly and well
Ladies and gentlemen , you emphasised the need to carry through practical measures relating to basic sport
You placed the emphasis on projects in the field rather than on reports and studies
You highlighted the need for a partnership between sports organisations and education organisations
Lastly , you clarified the objectives of our Year of Education through Sport and you pointed out the need to respect the principle of subsidiarity and the respective competences
All these demands have been taken into account and included in the final decision
I am therefore quite convinced , ladies and gentlemen , that this European Year of Education through Sport will be a great Year
Our work on the value of sport , on social and educational sport , will help to bring this about
I am delighted to say that education and sport are at the centre of everyone 's daily concerns
The only thing we have to do , and we will succeed in this , is to promote the positive aspects of sport over the negative tendencies
We are already thinking about a schedule , events and setting up an advisory committee
I must admit that , as you can see , this vote is not the final whistle marking the end of an im@@ pecc@@ ably played political game
Rather , it is the starting p@@ is@@ tol
Of course , Parliament will be regularly informed of the progress made on the European Year
Mr President , I spoke just now of the historic vote on education through sport
In this connection , I would like to ask you to reflect on the following questions
In a Europe which wants to be close to the citizens , can we continue to see sport just as a commercial activity ?
Should we not take notice of the fact that sport has pride of place in the citizens ' daily lives ?
Is sport not an important part of any citizenship policy ?
Both in normal situations and in extreme situations , in margin@@ ali@@ zed areas , when there is a need for integration , amongst many others
Furthermore , it is a great tool for educating on issues such as the environment , food , health , teamwork etc
We should take the greatest possible advantage of this
What we do want is to fill the vacuum left by subsidiarity so that the Europeans can benefit from the numerous positive aspects of sport
I see it as a good start that we are able , today , to discuss it during the day
The European Year of Education through Sport can make use of this public interest in order to highlight the social value of sport
For me , however , it all keeps coming back to the importance of asking what we mean by fair play , which is inseparable from sport
I believe that racism , doping , and the treatment of sports@@ women and sportsmen as commodities have left deep scars on the image of fair play
In the same way , we should be treating women in sport with a new respect , and doing something about their status in this area too
That is also underlined by our call for clubs to be involved in the Year of Education through Sport - something not called for in the first proposals
There are 600 000 sports clubs , with thousands of officials , and they make a very important and essential educational contribution that we can never dispense with
Ladies and gentlemen , 2003 , the Year of People with Dis@@ abilities , is almost upon us
This is where there is a need for public awareness and also for financial support
All this underscores our demand for this to be incorporated into the Treaty
I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on this important report
Parliament has been pressing us for a European year of sport in previous resolutions , the last of which was in 1997
Up to now , the European Union has primarily paid attention to professional sport and much less to recreational sport and its cultural , educational and social merits
Sport is not only important on a social and cultural level but on a financial one as well
According to estimates , the sector accounts for about 2 % of the European Union 's total gross domestic product
Sport is of great significance as a dissemin@@ ator of positive values such as will@@ power , courage , tolerance , loyalty and friendship
In this European Year the spotlight will be on sports education and training for young people , and this is therefore something to be celebrated
It is also true to say that less and less time and attention is devoted to sports education at school , a trend that urgently needs to be reversed
This is where sports clubs can play a complementary , supporting role for schools
It is therefore essential to improve links between clubs and schools
Mr President , I commend the rapporteur and welcome this excellent initiative
That is why I strongly and warmly welcome the celebration of the European Year of Education through Sport 2004
I am most looking forward to seeing the positive impact that sport will have on the lives of young people from disadvantaged communities as a result of this programme
It will present sport as a way of improving the social inclusion of these groups and communities
That said , however , I welcome the Council 's recognition of the will of Parliament on this issue
Mr President , the value of sport as a tool to promote national identity and further integration has long been recognised
Not for nothing have both democratic and totalitarian governments used taxpayers ' funds on sporting activities
Therefore , whatever the fine rhetoric that might flow from this House , the true aim of this particular European Year is to promote further European integration
In other words , this is naked propaganda
It is not a coincidence that the Year has been declared to coincide with the Olympic Games
Members of this House may think otherwise , but this is a cynical attempt to hijack the Games in order to promote the European agenda
It is therefore outrageous that European taxpayers ' money is to be spent on this project
5 million may be a small amount in the gr@@ ander scheme of things , but it is still a lot of money
There is no justification
We are not here to finance such naked and cynical propaganda
Our intention is to convey this concept and these values in a debate which embraces the education systems too
These must receive support and assistance
These rules are profoundly democratic and promote dialogue and compan@@ ion@@ ship
Educ@@ ating through sport means ensuring democratic values for future generations and this must appear in the Treaties
Mr President , I want to thank my colleague , Mrs Doris Pack , for the valuable work she has done in producing this report
You have done some really excellent work for many years now to promote sport and physical education
It has been a genuine pleasure to work with you
It is excellent that the Commission should have begun to organise a Year of Sport
The positive role of physical exercise as a basis for mental and physical well-being is now becoming common knowledge throughout Europe
The very fact that exercise is able to prevent mental problems often gets little attention
Ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise can help keep a nation 's major economic problems in check
An enormous amount of lost working time could have been prevented through exercise
5 million granted for the Year is at least not over@@ sized
Schools in many Member States organise important optional activities after the school day has officially finished
Resources to make these afternoon activities possible must be increased considerably , as there is a huge demand for what they can provide
Af@@ ter@@ noon clubs organised voluntarily often do valuable work
Af@@ ter@@ noon sports programmes help children satisfy their natural desire and need for exercise
At the same time , they are doing something meaningful and social problems and exclusion are being prevented
Why can we not talk of sport as sport ?
It is ridiculous that sports projects in the legal basis have to be hidden away under other articles , as there is not one for sport
It is better to call things by their own name , both now and in future
Mr President , I will be very brief , because I know that time is flying by and that you have a very full agenda
Today one might say , her baby is being taken to church to be b@@ ap@@ tised
I would like to respond briefly to a number of specific questions which have been asked
My co-@@ workers are already working with the International School Sport Federation to see what can be done to accommodate Parliament 's request
I am fully aware , Mr President , that Parliament does not want an avalanche of studies on the matter
That is all well and good , provided that it does not turn round afterwards and say that studies would have been useful after all
I have already received numerous requests from the major European sports federations , who want to contribute to or participate in the project or to work with us
They all want to be involved and to make their contribution to the enterprise
They will not ask us for money , for they have much more money than we have
A number of questions have been asked relating to the European Year of People with Dis@@ abilities , on which we are actively working
The Special World Olympics will take place in summer 2003 in Dublin
In this context , we will fund the hiring of Irish volunteers to make this major sporting festival for people with disabilities possible
The first experiment , in Dublin , will thus bring together 200 volunteers from all over Europe
In other words , our young people will take centre stage
You can therefore see that practical measures are currently being taken
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at 11
The next item is the Commission statement on services of general interest in Europe
This is the case in Europe , in particular , where the goal - which was also a necessity - of creating a single market has certainly facilitated this development
Furthermore , a higher level of competition throughout the economy has led to an increase in the effectiveness of services of general interest
The history of the Community has always been consistent
At each new stage in European integration , progress has been made towards both freer movement of goods , persons , services and capital and greater inclu@@ siveness and cohesion
This was the case as regards the Single Act and the case at Maastricht and Amsterdam too
Article 16 of the Treaty , introduced at Amsterdam , explicitly recognises the role of services of economic general interest
The Commission has always recognised the pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al role of services of general interest
In its 1996 communication on services of general interest in Europe , it proposed a reference to the promotion of these services
The sectoral legislation adopted at Community level relating to major network industries , particularly the energy sector , contains extremely ambitious goals as regards high quality public services
Services of general interest are thus an essential component of the European model of society
They contribute to the citizens ' quality of life and are an essential condition if the citizens are to be able to exercise many of their rights fully
The Commission decided to carry out this examination within the framework of a Green Paper
There are two main reasons why it has adopted this approach
Firstly , the questions raised are very broad in scope and cannot be addressed in a debate limited to a proposal for a framework directive
We must not underestimate the technical and conceptual problems which would certainly be raised by the establishment of a framework directive either
The Green Paper will allow the Commission firstly to examine whether a framework directive would be appropriate and secondly to launch a large-scale debate on the overall issue
Therefore , the purpose of this Green Paper is not to delay the feasibility study on a framework directive
This work could , moreover , be a useful contribution to the Green Paper
As regards the timetable , the Green Paper should be adopted in March 2003 and the conclusions drawn before the end of the year
This , Mr President , is the Commission 's statement on this matter
Since then , the Commission has done little
It has submitted four documents
I do not at all understand , Commissioner , why the Commission does not have its proposals debated here in Parliament , openly and with no holds barred
We are not prepared to take the rap for whatever decisions the Commission comes up with if Parliament cannot be properly involved in the legislative process
So let me say quite bluntly that , as you have already mentioned , we called for a framework directive
We called for a framework directive on the basis of Article 95 , which deals with the internal market
That means that this public debate on the basis of Article 95 leads to a decision by Parliament and the Council by way of the codecision procedure
the topic will give rise to a great debate on social and economic policy
Far from being something that the Commission can sort out with the Council behind closed doors , that must be done in public view , here in the direc@@ tly-@@ elected Parliament
I call on the Commission to stop bi@@ ding its time and do the business at long last
The European Court of Justice 's ruling in the Fer@@ ring case is a workable basis on which to evaluate state aid and public services
I call upon you to be prompt in submitting decisions based on it and to delay no longer
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would naturally like to thank the Commissioner for her announcement and for the prospect of a Green Paper
However , I do not often find myself in complete agreement with what Mr Langen has said
My group is particularly disappointed with the Commission 's reluctance to proceed with presenting the European Parliament with a framework directive
As you yourself said , services of general interest are the cornerstone of our European social model
My group , and in fact the whole of Parliament , has been pressing for this framework directive for years
Even the Council is ahead of the Commission , as the Council pressed for this framework directive in Nice and then much more explicitly in Barcelona
Despite this , the Commission insists on broad consultation first via a Green Paper in the spring of 2003
I understand that the problems surrounding services of general interest are complex
I understand the differences in approach between the Member States
I know that there are public and private players involved , and it is therefore true that there are differences depending on the sector
my group is in favour of the internal market , subject to certain social and ecological adjustments
The Green Paper will furthermore arrive too late to contribute to the discussion in the Convention about the role of services of general interest
We are already holding this discussion at this moment
We will be completing it in February , and the Commission will not be presenting a Green Paper until March
I think that the Commission will be missing the boat
Finally , there is one last reason , one fact that causes me great concern , and that has to do with Mr Langen 's comments
However , the Treaty is undeniably lacking in clarity
Recent conclusions by two advoc@@ at@@ es-general at the European Court of Justice have demonstrated that this principle is no longer above suspicion
The Commission will now obviously conclude that they cannot give legal security to Member States in the area of the financing of services of general interest
So what has happened to this much-vaunted autonomy to organise their own public services ?
Ladies and gentlemen , the conclusion is clear to us
Firstly , we will immediately ask the Commission to issue a framework directive , as we have repeatedly done
Secondly , the Convention must provide the opportunity to establish the basic principles of public services with complete respect for the powers of the Member States
Thirdly , our constitution must clearly specify that services of general interest are our people 's social rights and must not be left to market rules and competition
I hope that the Commission can support us in our ambitions
The promise of future consultation and feasibility studies is to be welcomed , but this should not be an excuse for doing nothing
In that sense I agree with my colleagues that something has to happen sooner rather than later
Process can be important , and we must get that right
I would like to make two points on behalf of my group , the first relating to competition
Perhaps it would be interesting to look at a country outside the EU - Switzerland - in terms of energy policy
Recently the Swiss had a referendum to ascertain whether they should liberalise their energy provision , presently provided by their local can@@ tons
Swiss citizens voted against this because they were not satisfied that choice in that sense would raise standards - it might just prove confusing
That question was put to the citizens of Switzerland
We , on the other hand , are waiting for a framework to establish how we should introduce such choices across Europe
The second issue of particular importance to my group is universal services provision
This guarantees social cohesion across Europe
It is ridiculous that the Convention and its working groups are currently discussing these issues
These matters call for coordination as we move forward with the development of Europe
So it is good that something is actually happening , it is good that there has been a statement , but let us get on with it
Mr President , I welcome the fact that we are debating services of general interest once again , on the occasion of the Commission 's statement
I believe that services of general interest are at the heart of European integration , or rather that they ought to be
There has been growing pressure for faster liberalisation in many sectors
The Brussels European Summit , last March , was a decisive moment in this sense , moreover
the recurring argument is that liberalisation would be the solution to the need to modernise these services
This is not true , as we can see from numerous examples
I believe that one of the functions of services of general interest is to ensure social and territorial cohesion
They must guarantee access to high quality services for all citizens throughout the whole of the territory and at the same price
However , the rules of profitability and the principle of competition run counter to these objectives and these functions
The citizens ' needs as regards high quality European public services are currently being expressed in many Union countries
The drawing-up of common European rules allowing harmonisation from the top downwards has become a necessity , particularly in view of enlargement
The modernisation of services of general interest must be part of a measure not seeking to open up the market to competition but intended to respond to the needs expressed
That requires genuine democratisation and the genuine participation of workers and users in the development of these services
In this connection , the European Union has a particular responsibility
It must , first of all , allow a proper evaluation to be carried out of the different liberalisation processes , country by country
They must therefore no longer be subject to competition
Work is being carried out on a new Treaty within the framework of the work of the Convention with a view to the 2004 Intergovernmental Conference
We must address this issue in the debate on the Treaty
It is time to listen to the demands of the citizens , of the trade unions , which are demonstrating everywhere in a plea for high quality services
These demands go hand in hand with the need for a Europe of social progress , a more democratic Europe
That is why we cannot be content with a minimal definition of a European universal service
We must be ambitious for social Europe
We must place services of general interest at the centre of European integration and European citizenship
You have decided to open a broad consultation process on the Green Paper
to make themselves heard during this consultation on the Green Paper
I believe that the Commission 's concern continues to focus too heavily on the first point and too little on the second , the distortion of competition
Today , this conflict of interests has yet to be resolved in many European countries
There are countless cases of the allocation of inappropriate market spaces to such companies
there are public services which ultimately create state companies that distort competition
I would like to make one last point , Mr President , Commissioner
There is a service , the mobile telephone service , which the Commission does not deem to be a service of general interest
I feel that this is a serious mistake and that , now , the mobile telephone service is to all intents and purposes a service of general interest
That being so , I want to give an example of how we in this House can bring some influence to bear
We in this House delivered an unambiguous opinion on it in 2001
And what is the Council doing ?
It has sho@@ ved the draft in a dra@@ wer , done nothing with it , and still does not want to do anything with it
Why , ladies and gentlemen , is this issue of legislation on local public transport so important ?
The law on the situation we are in is unclear
The second point I want to address is as follows
I believe that a slip of the tongue has crept in here
It is competition that decides , and the public that benefits
Mr President , I am deeply disappointed by the Commission 's statement here today
We have had more lip service to the principle of services of general interest
We urgently need the framework directive , not a Green Paper
Solidarity and citizenship are at the heart of the whole notion of the European Union
They sustain environmental sustainability
They are a key component of any serious s@@ patial strategy which will enable us to have sustainable rural communities and indeed live@@ able cities
They will provide us with healthy citizens who do not fear illness
They will enable citizens to comm@@ ute and to communicate
They will enable citizens to be well-informed , to be well-@@ educated , not only in terms of technological education , but also politically liter@@ ate
All of these things are necessary if we are to create a Europe of which we can be proud and which citizens will feel they own
It does , however , strike me as incomprehensible that the final conclusions and specific initiatives associated with it are to appear as long as six months later
Analy@@ ses and the demands for action resulting from them belong together
There are marked distinctions to be drawn between the successes and failures in the various lines of business involved
has the cost of the service increased or fallen ?
has its quality improved or got worse ?
have the service 's employees experienced an improvement or a deterioration in their social conditions ?
This also involves putting the service providers on an equal footing irrespective of their ownership structures
Mr President , Commissioner , I expect your morning could have been more pleasant
What is more , you have the task of representing the Commission and your colleagues who are directly responsible for the matter , who have delegated this task to you
However , that is part of the job
I am not going to talk about the content , for my fellow Members have already amply expressed what are my views too
I have famili@@ ar@@ ised myself with the most recent Commission document , a concise text which was produced a few days ago
It points out , in particular , that the first general document on the subject produced by the Commission dates back to 1996
Six years on , the Commission has announced a Green Paper
I do not feel that this is a responsible way to behave
In any case , I believe that there is no point , ladies and gentlemen , in continuing to ask the Commission to produce documents
the Commission is divided
There is clearly no political leadership , which is disturbing considering that the Commission has sole right of initiative
I feel that we Members of Parliament must now shoulder our responsibilities within the Convention
A number of contributions have already been submitted on the subject of services of general interest and the reconciliation thereof with competition law
In its first contribution to the Convention , in May , the Commission itself pointed out how important it is that we have legal bases for services of general interest
The Commission is therefore both aware of the problem and incapable of taking political decisions
Although the solution is simple , clearly , the Member States still have to impose it
Similarly , there must be an end to the inconsistent behaviour of the Commission at international level
As regards all these points , Mr President , the Member States meeting at the Council must take things in hand without delay
We therefore demand that the procedure be speeded up and that Parliament 's resolutions be acted upon
Commissioner , there is such a thing as the Lisbon process , which speaks unambiguously in terms of the European Union having social cohesion as its objective
A large proportion of services of general interest are provided on a voluntary basis and not only as a main job
They contribute to a higher degree of humanitarianism , and , as a rule , they are at home in the area between the state and the private sector
The support they receive from the state is not to be regarded as state aid , and they are private , although not wholly subject to competition law
It is for this precise reason that we need a legal framework that provides legal certainty
Christmas being only a few days away , I would like to extend the warmest thanks to those who work , whether professionally or voluntarily , for the common good
Without them , our society would be a col@@ der place , and the European social model would be unworkable
The Commission is , indeed , very behind and we can only wonder what this means
Where liberalisation is concerned , we legislate and we set dates without even planning proper mid-term reviews
When it comes to public services , we organise debates on debating documents
I am thinking , by way of example , of the British railways , of employment and territorial cohesion
I am thinking of the postal services and the risk that oligo@@ polies will form , and another example is telecommunications
You cannot but be aware that the race for profit in public transport leads to disasters
We reject any privatisation of public services and any introduction of the concept of profit or profitability
To a large degree , such commercialisation is justified , but thought ought also to be given to whether or not we should go down this road
Much has already been said about the Green Paper and the Convention , and also about the question of whether we have left things too late
There are two points that are of great importance to me , and that I would like to see resolved once and for all
One feature of the discussion on services of general interest is that the Commission is willing to get involved only where economic activity is concerned
I am sure that this is perfectly understandable in principle , but it always ends up being about questions of detail
Is an ambul@@ ance service an economic activity ?
It is not acceptable for decisions - like those on savings banks - to be at short notice and always , immediately beforehand , forwarded only for information
My second point relates to subsidiarity , which does , indeed , loom large in the Convention 's deliberations
What must not be allowed to happen is standards being imposed by the Commission through the back door
That is why definitions must not be imposed through the back door
You started by mentioning in your introduction that we are engaged in a discussion , and one that is being conducted in a very open way
At any rate , that is how it came across when interpreted into German
Open as regards the possible outcome or open in the way the discussion is conducted ?
Both interpretations make me uneasy
This is yet another exercise in avoiding doing anything , whilst , at the same time , very practical preparations are going ahead in other areas
Take the so-called non-@@ paper dated 12 November , with its margin numbers - all 102 of them
You discuss these things with others , but not with us
I just want to pick up one point and be told what the Commission really thinks about it
' An enterprise may provide more than one service to the public , some of them realising a profit and others showing a loss
Even if the enterprise does not provide public services , its services may cross-@@ subsidise each other '
What that means is that , if we get an answer , we would be resolving an important financial issue , one that would help bring legal certainty
What we need right now is an answer and not this or that Green Paper , which serve only to delay the discussion process for ever and a day
These developments have won the firm opposition of workers and of society as a whole , as demonstrated recently by the general strike in Portugal
So , Commissioner , what commitments can you give in this context of the WTO ?
As the last speaker , Commissioner , I can either repeat the comments of those who have already spoken or oppose them
I will try to make one or two additional points
They must take heed , for the Constitution is to be ratified by referendum
My second point is as follows
If the concept of public services is not present , our citizens will stop believing in a European social model and see it as devoid of sense
This concept must therefore be introduced
Do not fall into the trap of jumping from ideology of ' all state ' to the ideology of ' all market '
The go@@ d of competition does not need a monument
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 11
The next item is the vote
Draft amendments to the draft general budget 2003 as modified by the Council
Mr President , I have some technical changes to announce before the vote
He has managed to unite all the Member States and find solutions with us to very difficult issues
He has paved the way for the very broadly accepted solutions that form the basis for this , hopefully , short and uncomplicated vote today
I thank the Danish presidency very much
Finally , I warmly thank the sittings services who have always handled complicated issues on voting lists etc
Now I turn to the formalities
Before the vote on the budgetary amendments starts , I must make a statement about some technical adjustments , some of which need to be put to the vote
A vote is necessary to confirm the following corrections
This should be withdrawn because it has also been covered by Letter of Amendment No 3
I suggest that we vote on these corrections en bloc before we start voting on the amendments
Unless this House accepts that explanation , which I do not , I ask you to make that check
It was evident from where I sit that it was the same majority
Secondly , the result has been announced
After a result has been announced , we will not go back on it
Mr President , Mr Färm , the rapporteur , has said all that I was going to say
I simply wanted to thank the presidency but also the sessional services for all the work they do to ensure that this process goes through so smoothly
We have voted a budget with commitments of just under EUR 100 billion
We have done it in record time
Mr President , you still have to ask the President-in-Office of the Council whether the Council agrees with this budget
I am quite happy to follow your advice
There are , however , still certain differences of opinion regarding the classification of the expenditure in the budget , on which the Council reserves its rights
The Council is , however , able to accept the budget as it emerges from Parliament 's second reading
Therefore , I would urge the House to support the switching of EUR 30 million
This money would otherwise have been used to compensate those who lost their livelihoods when we failed to renegotiate the Morocco Agreement
Since those funds are no longer required for compensation , they will be earmarked for helping the victims of the Prestige tragedy
I would urge the House to support this and show solidarity with the beleaguered fishermen and families in Galicia
Mr President , in normal circumstances this procedure , as it is being proposed by the Commission , would be totally unacceptable
The Prestige accident occurred on 19 November
All this could have been dealt with differently and in a different time frame
The proposal as it is violates certain principles
Firstly , it violates a procedure that is transparent
Secondly , it violates the principles of specific@@ ity of the budget established by the financial regulation
Having made all that clear , let us look at the political and the pragmatic approach
We , in the Committee on Budgets , are political and pragmatic people - not just budgetary people as people seem to think we are
As Mr Gerhard Schmid said to me a short while ago , not everyone believes in God but they all believe in the Committee on Budgets
Mr Wynn , I believe the applause indicates that the House deeply appreciates your exceptional outburst of pragmatism on this occasion
Mr President , my voting bu@@ tt@@ ons have mal@@ functioned
We take note of your intention but the result stands
That concludes the vote
I would like to make a point of order before you go
Mr Howitt , I hope you do not feel that you received the rough end of my treatment in this season of goodwill
I wish you all a very happy Christmas
I hope you have the relaxation and rest that we all deserve
I look forward to resuming with vi@@ m and vigour in the New Year
This proposal aims to ensure that the flexibility instrument is used
We must ensure that the commitment given last year by the budgetary authority , to include EUR 27 million in the 2003 budget , is met
The 2003 draft budget is , in itself , sound
In the light of this doubt and in the absence of any clarification from Commissioner Nielson , we cannot vote for this budget line
The EU 's Budget procedure is becoming a set ritual every year
Parliament wants to spend more money than the European Commission is proposing , but the Council guards the Member States ' pur@@ ses by wanting to spend less
The result is an ever-increasing disparity between the expenditure ceiling agreed in 1998 and actual spending
As a representative of the Socialist Party in the Netherlands , I am faced with two choices each time
It goes without saying that this will entail higher taxation levels than the governing neo-liberal politicians want
These taxes have to be collected from the top earners and from companies
However , accepting higher spending and higher taxes does not mean that we are happy to spend a great deal more money on an unnecessarily centralised EU
We regard part of the EU 's expenditure as a waste that only goes to support bureaucracy and megalom@@ ania
Even the structural funds and the common agricultural policy , which could deliver benefits for poor regions and small farmers , are sometimes spent on the wrong things
We should remember that one potential contribution to this year that must be included is Euro 2004 , which will be held in Portugal
Nevertheless , the appropriations that have been earmarked are limited and do not match the concerns that have been expressed - this is something we regret
We are also voting in favour of the report because we hope that this aspect will still be given further consideration
I wish to congratulate Mrs Pack on her excellent report , which I fully support
Sport is acknowledged to be a major social phenomenon in Europe , and constitutes an extremely important educational tool
Like the rapporteur , I feel that the importance of the effect that the Olympic ideals can have on education should be emphasised
Sport contributes , in particular , to increasing the social skills of young people , such as team spirit , solidarity and fair play
The Commission has proposed that 2004 should be designated ' the European Year of Education through Sport '
It should be remembered that in that year , the European Football Cham@@ pion@@ ships will be held in Portugal and the Olympic and Par@@ aly@@ m@@ p@@ ic Games will take place in Athens
Schools sports must , in fact , be a priority within sports policy and must , at the same time , occupy a prime position in schools and educational policy
The Commission has tried to give me explanations during the debate , but they are not convincing
Firstly , it claims that the two decisions are not connected because they are not simultaneous
It is true that they are separated by a year but , in terms of reasoning , they are very closely related
Moreover , they are presented as such at the start of the explanatory statement of the agreement
Secondly , it states that the number of illegal immigrants coming from Hong Kong is very small
To cap it all , we learn that the final approval was given at the beginning of December by an Agriculture Council meeting
What they can expect from this agreement is questioning , imprisonment and finally expulsion
Because Hong Kong was once stolen from China and subsequently le@@ ased , China was entitled to have it returned
However , this is causing a problem for the many people who now live there
They have a higher standard of living than those around them and make greater demands on their government
They want to contribute critically to government policy , and yet they have simply been transferred from one colonial power to another
The ' one country , two systems ' arrangement may guarantee the continued existence of capitalism , but it does not guarantee the introduction and development of democracy
It is therefore to be expected that many people will feel unsafe there and will want to leave
They want to go to Europe , the USA or Japan , where they are more likely to find the kind of society they have become used to
On the other hand , the Chinese Government wants to make Hong Kong more like the rest of the country
I therefore doubt whether an agreement on the readmission of refugees would really work
The intention that this agreement should become a model for other states in which critical people feel unsafe is even more controversial
As the amendment concerning the special partnership with Turkey has been rejected , I do not have to explain it in specific terms now
As the text has been rejected , however , there is no point in discussing it any further
Mr President , like some other Members , I have abstained for several reasons
Firstly for those expressed by Mr Goebbels on several occasions , concerning the inadequacy of the funding earmarked for the Union 's enlargement
it provides for the accession procedure for ' European ' States
It does not cover other countries
What we believe was needed was to first open a joint discussion on the purposes and boundaries of the European Union , which could have been held within the Convention
You welcome the outcome of the Copenhagen European Council and , in particular , the integration of ten new countries into the European Union
We are in favour of the EU 's enlargement , considerably beyond , furthermore , the ten countries that you have just accepted
Enlargement in the form that you are undertaking it , however , simply enshrines the hegemony of the major capitals of Western Europe over the poorest and least developed countries
We have , therefore , voted against your self-congratul@@ ation
Seen from a historical perspective , achieving enlargement is an issue that lies at the very heart of the European Union
Enlargement is enabling us to revive the geographical , political and cultural identity of Europe
The prospect of a Union of 25 is now a reality
This enlargement , on an unparalleled scale , corresponds to an historic duty to reunite our continent
It also requires us thoroughly to reconsider the European project , the way in which an enlarged Europe will function
It also represents an opportunity
The accession of new Member States will increase the Union 's power and influence on the international stage
It has also discriminated against Cyprus , creating further doubts about what will actually happen there
Nevertheless , the reference in the Summit conclusions to the specific situation of Portuguese farming was made in such vague terms that it provides no guarantees at all
The consequences could be extremely damaging unless Portuguese interests are properly considered in the negotiations still to take place , even after the political decision on accession
There is a real risk of inequalities and differences being accentuated , with the aim of economic and social cohesion becoming increasingly distant
We also reject the conclusions ' support for closer links between the EU and NATO , under the comprehensive agreement that has been concluded
The European Council has not even exhausted the envelope set in Berlin for the period 2003-2006
At the time , this was supposed to fund the accession of six new States
With less money , we are now supposed to cater for ten new members
This is shamefully little , given the structural problems of almost all these countries
Under the Marshall plan , for five years after World War II , the USA transferred 1 % of its GDP at the time to Europe
The Copenhagen Summit and its decision to enlarge the ? U was a very important act of imperialist expan@@ sion@@ ism
The main purpose of making such derisory resources available is to strengthen the power of capital and tear down any social achievements left over from the socialist era
A final decision was taken on operations by the European army in the FYROM , with similar operations planned in Bosnia-Herzegovina
This brings in ten new states , most of them relatively small , including six which have recently achieved independence by democratic means
During the current fisheries negotiations , on the other hand , we have been warned not to expect too much since the UK lacks solid allies in Europe
There are five million Danes and five million Scots
I salute the huge achievement of one of the ancient small nations of Europe
I look forward to the day when my own ancient nation can play a similar role
The idea that small states count for nothing while large ones can cut the mu@@ st@@ ard has been shown up for the nonsense it is
My vote was motivated by these thoughts , as well as by a great satisfaction at seeing this greater Union safely achieved
This will result in the contributions to the structural funds that have already been established being redistributed amongst a larger number of Member States than initially planned by 2006
There will be much less money available to the farmers in the new Member States than to their counterparts in the present Member States
The Netherlands ' calculated efforts in particular have failed
That is not likely to prevent Central Europe from being the poor c@@ ous@@ in of the West for a long time to come
I have voted in favour of the resolution
We Swedish Christian Democrats sincerely welcome the fact that the division of Europe can now be a thing of the past
The Second World War has thus been brought to a definitive end
The EU is no longer just a form of West European cooperation , but not far from being pan-European
I therefore find it deeply regrettable that Amendment No 13 , which calls attention to this fact , was not adopted
The Copenhagen Summit will go down in history as a summit of total incoherence
The day following the Copenhagen Summit , a major Par@@ is@@ ian daily ran the headline ' Bush opens Europe 's door to Turkey '
The European Council has indeed given in to pressure from the US and the joint NA@@ TO@@ /EU letter issued after the summit at@@ tests to this
It suggests that Turkey should henceforth be fully involved in the Union 's foreign security and defence policy
Copenhagen has therefore put in place all the necessary elements to ensure that the European Union will never see the light of day
The outcome of the Copenhagen Summit has left a bitter taste in everyone 's mouth
The Europe that the Heads of State are building fluctu@@ ates between powerlessness and contempt
We then see contempt when the Eurocrats meeting in the Convention take decisions concerning 450 million citizens on basic constitutional texts without involving or consulting these citizens
Con@@ tempt has been shown towards the ten new countries which will have to undergo further waves of liberalisation and privatisation
Con@@ tempt for the populations of Turkey who , according to Giscard d' Estaing , do not share ' the Christian values of European civilisation '
With them , here as I did there , I have rejected the outcome of this summit
It is being suffered by Galicia because that is where the majority of traffic passes , but it is genuinely a European problem
We would all gain from learning , point by point , from this terrible lesson
This lesson must , therefore , be technically rigorous , scientifically precise and politically unbiased and dis@@ passionate
What is important here is the sea - not Mr Aznar
These floating dumps , however , are treated with a reprehensible tolerance by some shipping companies and some flag States , not least Turkey , which heads the blacklist
I spoke yesterday of the need to clearly establish the liability of char@@ tering companies , in order to encourage them to tighten up their practices
What oil slicks also demonstrate , however , is the complete surrender of their sovereign role by flag States who do not ensure that their ships comply with maritime law
This is why the States that are affected by oil slicks should systematically pursue the international liability of the flag State concerned at the International Court of Maritime Law
Spain , therefore , should today - and France tomorrow , probably - take the Ba@@ ham@@ as to the Court in Hamburg
Establishing the liability of the charterer and determining that of the flag State are probably the two most promising ways of preserving the marine environment
The most badly affected States should defend these means and pursue them jointly
If Mr Schnellhardt 's machine had worked - he has told you that this is not the case - the amendment would have been rejected
I believe that you should take account of the fact that a machine does not work , especially if the Member informs you straightaway
It is actually extremely important for us when an amendment is adopted or rejected by a single vote
I believe I am within my rights , Mr President to tell you that I do not agree with the way you have handled this matter
You are completely mis@@ interpreting the Rules
when we have a roll call vote and when we call the result , the result stands
That has been the constant practice of all my predecessors and is consistent with the Rules
I sometimes regret that , owing to technical problems , Members ' votes are not properly registered
However , I have followed to the letter a precedent on which I exercise zero discretion
Close at it was , c@@ ' est la vi@@ e , Madame
Mr President , on a point of order , if that is how the Rules are , then they are stupid and should be changed
Mrs Lulling , this is then in your hands
I wish you a happy Christmas in redrafting the Rules
That concludes the explanations of vote
( The sitting was suspended at 12
No one will be surprised if I say that this European Commission report gave us yet another opportunity to confirm that the equal opportunities situation is totally unsatisfactory
Unfortunately , however , the European Commission report is also unsatisfactory
It is still a descrip@@ tive annual report
Of course the 2001 report contains more facts and figures than previous reports but it is still the product of a routine exercise
It fails to illustrate properly either where we have failed to achieve our targets or commitments or the real difficulties in applying our policies at European and national level
Although it refers to future developments , it fails to set specific commitments or timetables
Turning now to individual issues , the European Commission is clearly finding it hard to apply equal opportunities and is failing to do so adequately
Some Directorates-General are not making commitments in this area
At the same time , action to encourage more women to apply to participate in applications has been unsuccessful
The same applies to the Member States , which are having trouble understanding gender equality and implementing it in practice
Where there are no central or regional political support mechanisms , equal opportunities programmes are not being applied
During the forthcoming year , 2003 , the European institutions and Member States will need to act boldly and decisively
We shall be preparing for the first European elections to include the candidate countries in 2003 , and for national elections in various Member States
The Council recommendations on the equal participation of men and women have not brought about the expected results
Nor does the Council have a competent agency to help improve the coordination of equ@@ al@@ ity-@@ related issues
All of this , you will say , has been said many times before , and you would be right
Numerous people have commented , both inside and outside Parliament , that we women and some of the men working on these issues are becoming tiresome and repeating ourselves
We need to ask ourselves why they make these comments
Why does this issue not affect our society or at least not with the degree of importance we attach to it as regards both the human and economic factor ?
Why are our policies and principles not being applied directly and properly ?
I think that now more than ever we need to conduct a broad , ground-breaking dialogue with society and with those responsible for exercising European policy
What we want from the European Commission , Commissioner , are good ideas and efficient ways of applying them
Where the European Commission cannot force the Member States , it should encourage them to realise that equality brings benefits , not losses and difficulties
Very progressive and inspiring ideas have been explored , and these encourage the Commission to continue its efforts towards this objective
As we did in the last annual report , we have taken care , in the report on 2001 , to take your comments and proposals into account
I would like , at this point to enlarge on one point in particular , the evaluation issue
These efforts have to do both with the assessment of the 2001-@@ 2005 framework strategy and also with the financial plan
It is envisaged that a provisional report on these activities will appear at the end of 2003
It is precisely this to which you have just drawn attention , and we will make it our common concern to carry out an assessment in this area
Another reason why the coming year will be significant is that we will be focussing on how to balance the participation of women and men in the decision-making processes
Your report will be a very valuable help to us in doing this
In 2004 , we will be concentrating on the crucial area of combating negative stereo@@ ty@@ ped images of women
Mis@@ ogyn@@ istic clichés , being a substantial obstacle to equal treatment for both gen@@ ders , can and must be combated
In any case , misogyn@@ istic clichés should soon be seen as ridiculous re@@ lics of times that are no more
Parliament has insisted on the best possible utilisation of funds for this purpose
This communication will be a valuable instrument in the programme 's mid-term assessment
The success of European enlargement policy is dependent on the common rules being correctly applied
This resolution is of great importance in terms of the conclusions to be drawn at criminal level as regards the trafficking in human beings
Commissioner , we are dealing with the annual report for 2001 on the progress and difficulties observed in the achievement of equal opportunities
The political measures implemented are being analysed but their consequences are not being assessed
Once again we have to insist on the need to create more and better jobs between now and 2010 , in accordance with the objectives set at the Lisbon Summit
We must insist on the need to guarantee equality between men and women in all political fields , in accordance with Article 3 of the Treaty
The Barcelona European Council called on the Member States to eliminate the obstacles preventing women from fully participating in the labour market , in particular by creating cr@@ è@@ ches
Respect for and promotion of equality between men and women are part of the Community acquis and are therefore an essential condition for the new countries of the European Union
It is true that the Commission has made efforts to promote equality between men and women , but so far they have been insufficient
With regard to programmes funded with Structural Funds , it has been noted that the objective of equality has not been met , including in the Regulation referring to them
Even when certain programmes present it amongst their objectives , the results are not analysed and we know that this objective of equality is not really being met
The absence of women through balanced representation in decision-making bodies is significant , particularly social partners and other bodies
Additional efforts must be made so that the presence of women in decision-making bodies becomes a reality
It is cause for satisfaction that this issue has been included as a priority for 2003 and we hope that it yields positive results
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we have an almost balanced representation of Members here today for this debate on women 's rights
On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists , I would like to thank the Commission and Mrs Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for their reports
More rapid progress is being made in some areas
Last year , we adopted the directive on equal treatment in employment
That is a milestone , and we keenly await the first evaluation report
In other areas , things are taking a little longer
However , there are already clear pointers in the case of the Structural Funds and as regards combating violence
This House and I myself have for many years been calling for a European year of action against violence
We are also very anxious to see the proposal for a directive under Article 13 banning discrimination
There is also some delay on that
This needs to be pursued with great vigour
We also need to maintain the political will to make progress in involving women at all levels of decision making , both legally speaking and in practice
The outcome of the Convention in that respect has been very disappointing , so we need to act now
There is also still a great deal to be done in the European Parliament , and my criticisms are accordingly also aimed at this House
Let us not beat about the bush - Parliament is lagging somewhat behind the Commission when it comes to implementing gender mainstreaming internally
We need to make progress both in terms of political decision-making and as regards the administration
Bal@@ anced participation of women and men can only be achieved if a genuine political will exists , and it requires a top-down approach
We are particularly looking to the political group chairs , to the President of Parliament and to the committee chairs to set a clear example
It will be ready in time for the 2003 International Women 's Day
There are many other points appearing in both reports that I could comment on
I believe that ultimately the crucial factor will be the political will that needs to be demonstrated if the position of women is really to be improved
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , no sensible person would dare to reject the principle of equality between men and women , or in other words between human beings
In recent days , in my region , Galicia , this equality is being clearly demonstrated , through solidarity and also through pain
Yesterday as well , the media reflected the figures relating to domestic violence inflicted on women by their hus@@ bands , boy@@ friends or ex-@@ partners
In some sections of the media it was also pointed out that the great majority of victims did not recognise their situation
This is what seems to me to be the most serious violation of sex equality
And Article 21 states that all discrimination is prohibited and , in particular , discrimination on the grounds of sex , race etc
Progress has definitely been made on the question of gender equality , even if it is two steps forward and one step back
The fact that certain male colleagues have started to take the floor and enthusiastically support gender equality shows that progress has also been made within the European Parliament
It is a fact that resistance , with attitudes and structures generated by this long-standing patri@@ archy , often proves to be stronger than political will or even legislation
We are extremely worried by the fact that the European Commission keeps putting off a decision
What is the reason for this delay ?
Can the Commission tell us ?
Why is this decision so long in coming ?
Another issue is the fight against various forms of violence against women
We know that various forms of violence in the European Union have mush@@ ro@@ omed
We know that thousands of women are literally at the mercy of slave traders
Finally , I am delighted , Commissioner , that you have given priority in the 2003 programme to breaking the glass ceiling
This is a particularly worthwhile priority , because we predict that there will be an even balance of men and women in the new European Parliament following the 2004 elections
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , there are in all nine directives on equal treatment , but no measures to improve their implementation
That is why we need data and statistics to facilitate comparative assessments based on which solutions can be identified
A simple statement that men and women are equal before the law is not enough
The Commission 's priority theme for 2001 was equal pay
However , the report once again reminds us that women 's pay for the same or equivalent work continues to average only 76 % of men 's pay
The committee is actively working on the priority themes for 2002 and 2003 - the reconciliation of work and family life and the participation of women in decision-making processes
The provisions in force at present will have to be better adapted to current requirements
If women , and men too , opt for family life and to have children , that should not prevent them from participating in working life
Women need to be involved in decision-making processes at all levels
The only way to make credible progress with a policy for both sexes is by means of mutual cooperation based on equal opportunities
The objective should be to ensure that as many stakeholders as possible can participate in the relevant programmes
After all , appropriations are made available every year to support projects relating to women , for example in the Structural Funds and in particular in the 2000-2006 action programme
However , the procedures involved need to be rationalised and simplified , because they are too complicated , both at Community and at national level
I would like to conclude by very sincerely thanking Mrs R@@ od@@ i Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou for her balanced report
Unfortunately , the limited time we have available means that I can only touch on a few points
It is very important that we take equality seriously
We therefore need to take the pul@@ se of the equality policy , measure it and assess it
We therefore call for quantitative objectives for policies on employment and access for women to information , training and politics
A new stage is beginning in which we will have to be very vigilant
Equality - as many of us here know - needs to be fought for every day and every day no progress is made is in reality a step backwards
Many women are looking to the European institutions
Many of them live far from our prosperous Europe
For them , the progress we can make here is absolutely essential
We often say that there is no discrimination worse than that which comes from happening to be a woman
One does not choose to be born a woman
One is born one and , from that moment , one faces a huge number of obstacles which would not be there if one were a man
We are also talking about the expectations , the rights and the defence of equality for the majority of women in the world
This Parliament 's Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities has been working very intensively on all these issues
This committee has achieved , I believe , significant progress , but it is not sufficient
I believe that this excellent cooperation in our committee has borne fruit
Now that the time has come to evaluate the work of the year , we can all be pleased
Mr President , several Members have asked when the Commission will be bringing forward a proposal for a directive on discrimination based on gender under Article 13
The Commission will be presenting a proposal at the beginning of next year
The debate is closed
The vote will take place this afternoon at 5
the persistent pay differential and the explosion in trafficking in human beings and prostitution
I welcome the dynamism of our rapporteur , although I would like to make two observations
Firstly , we must remember the scale of poverty amongst women
Most of the 60 million people living beneath the poverty line in the EU are women
Secondly , we must remain vigilant over Europe 's desire to protect the equality of the sexes
In fact , the first preliminary draft of the constitutional treaty presented by the Convention in October 2002 causes me some concern
The Convention 's work programme , which is now dedicated to social issues , will enable this oversight to be corrected
Equal opportunities , addressed in Article 23 of the Charter , are a fundamental right and a value that we hold dear
Since 1975 , the date of the first directive on equal pay and treatment , progress has certainly been made , but a great deal remains to be done
Statistics broken down by gender and the gender dimension that is included in all our policies are essential prerequisites
This also requires a common effort to be made with the social partners to ensure that this fundamental principle is applied in every company and in all collective bargaining
Equal pay is only one issue within equality between men and women; let us not forget domestic violence , sexual exploitation , etc
Europe has a duty to set an example
I thank Mrs Krat@@ sa for having pursued this approach
The next item is the Commission statement on sustainable development in mountain regions
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Parliament is right to be taking an interest in mountain regions
The EC Treaty does not refer to the concept of mountain regions as such
It could be argued that specifically incorporating the concept of mountain regions into the Treaty would better reflect stakeholders ' concerns
For example , 95 % of mountain regions come under Objective 1 or Objective 2 of Europe 's structural policy
Compens@@ atory payments for less favoured regions made under the common agricultural policy also benefit mountain regions in many cases
The Commission has commissioned a study in order to assess the strengths and weaknesses of mountain regions more effectively
This definition is being drawn up on the basis of topo@@ graphical criteria , and in some cases climatic criteria are also taken into consideration
At the beginning of December 2002 , the contrac@@ tor carrying out the study presented the Commission with 16 possible definitions , and these are at present being examined in detail
A decision will be taken at the end of December as to which definition can be used
On the basis of this process of defining regions , a start can now be made on collecting statistical data
We expect that the process of collecting and analysing data and the presentation of the final report will be completed by September 2003
Under the CAP , mountain regions are chiefly supported by means of compensatory payments for less favoured regions
Consideration is at present being given to the future of these policies
The Commission 's proposals on the future of the regional policy are to be presented at the end of 2003 as part of the Third Cohesion Report
It would therefore be premature to prescribe at this early stage how mountain regions are to be taken into account in the forthcoming 200@@ 7-@@ 2013 planning period for regional policy
Under the current mid-term review of the common agricultural policy , the Commission 's proposal places particular emphasis on strengthening agri-@@ environmental measures , which often benefit mountain regions
As regards measures in favour of mountain regions under other Community policies , I would like to say a little more about competition policy and about general interest services
However , this article also specifies cases in which grants of state aid may be approved
Certain other areas may also be covered by this exemption
Furthermore , the Commission attaches great importance to services of general interest , as demonstrated by its communication of January 2001
However , as you know , maintaining and developing services of general interest is solely a matter for the individual Member States
The Commission can only offer encouragement in this field
In addition , the new Article 16 of this Treaty specifically recognises the important role played by services of general economic interest in promoting economic , social and territorial cohesion
The importance of these provisions was also emphasised by the Heads of State and Government at the Lisbon Summit in March 2000
The final point that I would like to mention is the Alpine Convention
Although this convention only directly affects four Member States , the Commission was involved in launching this initiative
It was not until summer 2002 that a sufficient number of signatories to the convention had ratified the various protocols so that it could come into operation
For its part , the Commission is investigating the various options available to it for more active involvement in the context of the Convention
The Commission has already presented its proposal for signing the transport protocol to the Council
However , I have to report that this proposal has so far not made much further progress within the Council
As you know , several states participating in the Alpine Convention have not yet ratified the protocols
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission will continue to pay close attention to issues concerning mountain regions
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for your statement , which suggests that mountain regions will perhaps no longer be entirely overlooked in European policy
Until now , unfortunately , mountain regions have rarely been a subject on which we have made observations or recommendations
And yet these regions warrant particular attention
Moun@@ tain areas offer a huge variety of riches
They are usually exceptional areas , which must therefore be managed in a very specific way , within a global policy of sustainable development of the mountains
These are complex areas due to their geography and their climate
We must therefore strengthen and update provisions to benefit young farmers
Lead@@ er and Interreg , inter alia , as you mentioned , Commissioner
The same applies to tourism
We must therefore give priority to structural projects aimed at promoting forms of transport that respect the environment and probably at giving a greater role to the railways
In mountain areas , this is , of course , more difficult , but , in the Alps , we have first-hand knowledge of these problems
We must also give priority to renewable energies such as water and wood and increase research into the prevention of both natural and material risks
In conclusion , the sustainable development of mountain areas can only be achieved if all partners are fully involved
I would also like you to know that we firmly intend to work together to ensure that our areas , which have very well-defined handicaps , can be effectively protected
I shall therefore dwell on a few points that complement what has just been said
We must also put in place economic and financial support and tax concessions of a structural and sustainable nature
Such measures are essential if we wish to combat the desertification and the ageing of these regions because , at the moment , these developments appear to be inevitable
I also wish to reiterate the importance of the EU 's environmental policy
Very often , when regions with a geographical handicap are forced to apply this regulatory approach , they find themselves totally dis@@ empowered
I would even say that they suffer genuine deprivation
Furthermore , in its work , the Convention must address our set of problems quite specifically
This concerns the territorial coherence and the cohesion of the European Union
Mr President , I would first like to say that we are at the end of the International Year of Mountains , which was organised by the United Nations
I think it is very positive that Parliament is able to discuss Europe 's role in this matter , particularly at the end of the Year of Mountains
I would also like to welcome , along with the Commissioner who is present and those who are absent , the fact that we are witnessing a change in perspective
Over the years , my colleagues here and I have criticised the Union 's lack of interest in the problems of mountain regions
I appreciated your speech , Commissioner , because you succeeded in summarising the various issues
I would like to briefly go back over a few matters
I think that we should take into account the important role of the Convention in this
I therefore think that progress should be made in this respect
Having said that , we should also look at the prospects for regional policy for 200@@ 7-@@ 2013
Why not consider a specific structural fund for mountain regions ?
Or , better perhaps , for areas that are geographically or naturally handicapped ?
I will not add anything regarding agriculture
Agriculture remains essential for safeguarding mountain regions
The same can be said about tourism , which Mrs Grossetête discussed in detail
I would like to add a few words on the International Convention on the Protection of the Alps
Unfortunately , I do not think that the Commission has sufficiently monitored the work of this Convention
Mountains are areas that contain some of the few remaining wildlife sanc@@ tu@@ aries left in Europe
They need special status as sensitive areas
There is a clause in the Treaty for ultra-@@ peripheral regions that provides for flexibility in adopting EU policies for special needs
This is what the Commission should be doing
It should declare mountains to be sensitive regions and then adopt legislation accordingly
It is disappointing that the Commission had no initiatives this year concerning mountains - not even a communication or a White Paper
We also need conventions for those areas to protect them
In relation to priorities , there is a conflict between the trans-European networks and the needs and concerns of people
It is quite clear that the people who have opposed trans-European networks have voiced real and true concerns
Their concerns have been ignored to prioritise the trans-European networks
This is a conflict
I urge the Commissioner to put pressure on the Member States
Mr President , mountain regions are proclaiming themselves as areas of economic , social and cultural life , but they are seeking recognition
Firstly , they are seeking recognition of their handicaps
Regions can only be classified as mountainous on the basis of their al@@ titude
Difficul@@ ty of access , harsh climate and dec@@ li@@ vity should also be taken into account
Moun@@ tain regions are also seeking recognition for the quality of their products
They do have a reputation for high quality , but that can only be valued if consumers can identify the products
Steps are being taken on this and we should support them
In promoting the mountain economy we need to take into account the fact that it is developing in a fragile environment that needs to be both preserved and developed
It is therefore difficult to find the balance , which needs to be supported by coherent legislation , which is not currently in place
I am thinking in particular of legislation on bringing livestock rearing and shep@@ herds ' hu@@ ts up to standard , which is difficult to implement in some mountain ranges
Conservation programmes , such as the LIFE and NA@@ T@@ UR@@ A 2000 programmes , for example , also have damaging consequences for economic activity
Moun@@ tain@@ ous regions will only remain open if everything possible is done to offer those who have chosen to live there prospects for the future , particularly young people
Agriculture , pa@@ stor@@ alism and forestry play an essential role in mountain regions
Not only do they generate quality products , but they are also the only means of maintaining sites and keeping them secure
In certain mountain ranges , however , pa@@ stor@@ alism is being put at risk by the reintroduction of predatory species , and the poor management of their populations
mountain regions are and must remain diverse
We should not make them into sanc@@ tu@@ aries , or into deser@@ ts
Up to now , the European Union has viewed its policy on mountain regions as part of agricultural policy
I believe that this issue needs to be seen as a whole and not just sector by sector
Moun@@ tain regions account for over 50 % of the total surface area of Member States such as Austria , Italy , Spain and Greece
I am delighted that the Commissioner has been able to inform us that a positive solution to the problem of creating a definition has now emerged
I think that in the final report to be presented in September 2003 this will provide us with a foundation on which we can build
The suggestions that it is too soon to be specific about financial issues may reflect an unavoidable degree of caution , but it is certainly not very satisfactory , Commissioner
I myself come from a mountain region which is in a relatively good position by virtue of its autonomous status
We have had some degree of migration , but only a low percentage in recent years
One possible measure would be for short-term changes to be introduced in competition policy
Cl@@ assi@@ fying mountain regions as sensitive zones in the treaties would also give a strong signal with this in mind
In my view , both Parliament and the Commission have treated policy on mountain regions rather sha@@ b@@ bi@@ ly
This conference was held in Brussels in October thanks to the efforts of Commissioners Fischler and Barnier
By way of conclusion , let me briefly mention the Alpine Convention
The Commission has been completely inactive in this area
The picture you painted was not quite accurate
I think there is an urgent need for action here
Madam President , our hearts leap up as we talk about mountains today , although , as always , the numbers in the Chamber are on the low side
However , mountains , as we know , cover 30 % of the Community 's territory
In countries such as my own , Italy , and in Greece , Portugal and Spain too , over 50 % of the land is defined as mountainous
Why , then , has there been so little attention paid to mountains throughout history ?
Because the inhabitants of the mountain regions are few
Between 5 and 7 % of the European citizens live in mountain regions , on average
There are few inhabitants who are therefore unable to form a strong lobby in terms of either numbers or wealth
That is a shame , for this may well be a historic time for the mountains in terms of their future and prospects
it is a complex , complete economic and social system
That , Madam President , is why , if you search for a directive in the database , you will find that the most recent directive dates back to 1975
the mountains have changed dramatically in that time but we are still working with a very outdated directive
Some of the Members have already made proposals and I too would like to make some demands
We must cling to the proposals of Article 15@@ 8 , which the Commissioner mentioned just now
This article calls upon the European Union to reduce and avoid development divides between the regions of Europe
Then the same article recognises the specific situation of the Community 's islands
When a hospital closes in a mountain region a serious problem is created
When , in particular , healthcare networks are insufficient , genuine difficulties ensue
That is why the mountains need overall , general measures
Allow me to add that Swedish mountain regions too have been presented in Parliament in recent times
The debate is closed
The next item is debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law
B5-0@@ 6@@ 50/@@ 2002 by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on Article 23 of Hong Kong 's constitution ,
The strength of Hong Kong lies in its success in retaining the principle of one country , two systems
I , together with many others , fear that this change will seriously undermine that principle , something which would naturally be completely unacceptable
The fact that China is pressing for this change to take place is not reassuring
We know that China often puts pressure on Hong Kong to get it to accept legislation there that exists in China
If the change is only a technical one , as Hong Kong maintains , the point needs to be made extremely clearly
I am afraid that that is not the way it is
I hope that the Commission will look into this issue very carefully
I also wish to appeal to the Hong Kong authorities to extend the period of referral for consideration and to be extremely vigilant where these changes are concerned
We hope that Hong Kong will not adopt the Chinese system of general rules that permit the completely arbitrary persecution of political opponents
Like Mrs Malmström , we particularly fear for Falun Gong supporters , whose peaceful protest does not justify persecution in any form
Hong Kong must be allowed to remain what it is , in the expectation that China will also go down the road to democracy and human rights
Only on this basis can we maintain the dialogue and the cooperation
In that regard , Hong Kong still to this day remains a unique phenomenon in the Chinese sphere of influence
Many people in China told us that developments towards greater democratisation and human rights could be expected in the future
We therefore view with the greatest concern the creation of the law to combat subversive activities in Hong Kong
We fear that this will be at the expense of freedom of speech , the objective administration of justice , religious and artistic freedom , scientific freedom and so on
That policy must be respected
It sounds almost too good to be true for Hong Kong
Article 23 of the Basic Law , however , is a potential time bomb under all of this
This article requests the drafting of laws against a whole range of serious crimes against the government of the People 's Republic of China
The Hong Kong authorities have embarked upon the implementation of this highly controversial article at a most inopportune moment , and in a manner that lacks transparency
That is why the residents of Hong Kong came out on the streets en masse at the beginning of this week
Does Hong Kong really give Peking reason to fear treason , secession , unrest , subversive activities , theft of state secrets or dangerous foreign political activities or connections ?
Yet the Chinese authorities are insisting on the implementation of Article 23
Mark you , this is an article that was given its current form only after the blood@@ bath in Peking 's Ti@@ en@@ an@@ men S@@ qu@@ are
Article 23 therefore reflects Chinese Communist parano@@ ia , both past and present
The same can be said of Hong Kong 's citizens ' fears then and now
While Hong Kong is going through a difficult economic period , Peking is making matters worse with its crippling political uncertainty
Even the business sector in Hong Kong is reacting negatively , and that speaks volumes
It reflects the broad dissatisfaction amongst the popul@@ ace with a de@@ sul@@ tory consultation process on the legal implementation of Article 23
What is lacking is the publication of the exact draft laws
Madam President , since July 1997 , the European Parliament has been a staunch defender of the autonomy of Hong Kong under the ' one-@@ country two-@@ systems ' policy
It is therefore appropriate that we should continue to monitor developments which could in any way undermine the autonomy of Hong Kong and threaten fundamental freedoms
En@@ ac@@ tment of legislation under Article 23 has raised such concerns
Last weekend , a large demonstration in Hong Kong illustrated the genuine concerns that Article 23 laws could undermine existing human rights and civil and religious liberties
I share these concerns and I urge the Hong Kong SA@@ R Government to address them in the final proposals that they bring forward
The re@@ interpretation of the Basic Law by the Standing Committee of the National People 's Congress during the right-@@ of-@@ abo@@ de case is still fresh in many people 's minds
There must not be a repeat of this with regard to Article 23 issues
My second point is that all countries need security legislation
I would argue that even what is proposed is milder than the recent H@@ om@@ el@@ ands Security Act passed in the United States , without much obvious protest from this House
We asked the Hong Kong authorities to ensure that the Article 23 proposal would not be used to silence opposition
I shall give a couple of quotes
A few days ago on 27 November , Mr Anton@@ y Le@@ ung , the Financial Secretary , was in the European Parliament
That was in front of our Members very recently
I put it to you that there is concern
I also look forward to having a clear and detailed provision and would like to see a draft bill for us to debate
But let us concentrate on getting good legislation , and not fall victim to those who want to campaign against the PR@@ C by pro@@ x@@ y
Madam President , in September the Hong Kong Government tabled a proposal for a new law threatening freedom of expression , of the press and of religion in the region
In that way , organisations and movements banned in communist China will also be banned in Hong Kong
The law would increase the authorities ' powers to control and thus to cen@@ sor everything printed in newspapers , as well as other media and other published material
Such material as was considered damaging to the region and to China as a whole would therefore be censored , and it would be a punishable offence to possess it
The vote is planned to take place in Hong Kong on Christmas E@@ ve
Let Christmas be celebrated through the withdrawal of Article 23
The Commission is conscious of the enormous significance and political sensitivity of this initiative , especially as regards the development of Hong Kong and China as a whole
That will probably happen in February 2003
The European Union is carefully monitoring developments in this area through its ambassadors
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at 5
B5-0@@ 6@@ 5@@ 2/@@ 2002 by Mr Trentin and Mr van den Berg on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the destruction of cultural heritage in Hebron ,
Madam President , the destruction of their cultural heritage is an open wound which ble@@ eds constantly for the Palestinians
Between 1948 and 19@@ 52 , the Israeli Government destroyed 4@@ 20 Palestinian villages , as documented by Israeli histor@@ ians
Some of the Arab districts of J@@ aff@@ a were destroyed
Throughout these years of military occupation , permission was never granted for restoration of the historic parts of the various cities
After the Oslo agreement and the creation of the Palestinian Authority , a very enthusiastic start was made on restoring the Old C@@ ities of N@@ abl@@ us , Bethlehem and Hebron
In the past two years , with the re@@ occupation of the autonomous territories , the destruction caused by the Israeli tanks and bombings has been huge
Six@@ ty-six palaces built between the thir@@ teenth and eigh@@ teenth centuries have been destroyed , including the car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ ai , the Turkish bath and the old so@@ ap factories
Moreover , their numbers have risen to over 15 000 in the past two years
The official justification given by the Israeli authorities in the military decree providing for the demo@@ lition of the houses in Hebron talks of security and military grounds
Nothing could be further from the truth
Ariel Sharon has clearly said that there is a need to build a link between the settlement of Q@@ i@@ ri@@ at Ar@@ ba and the Tom@@ b of the Pat@@ ri@@ arch@@ s
This is annex@@ ing of territory , for the Q@@ i@@ ri@@ at Ar@@ ba settlements are illegal
Over 2000 houses have been demolished in these past 2 years and 20 000 people have been wounded
I am sad to say that there have been many Israeli deaths too - over 600 now
The first illegal fact is the military occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip , which has now been in effect since 1967
Israel can no longer be allowed to continue to violate all international legislation , inflicting pain and suffering not just on the Palestinians but on its own people too
We must send out a signal to the Palestinians to give them hope of justice and to enable them to prevent the growth of fundamentalism
human rights and the right to life are equal for all people
the demo@@ lition must stop
Ladies and gentlemen , the Middle East has a unique heritage , rich in symbols and history
But that heritage , which for too long has undergone the colonial conflict ravaging Palestine , is in danger of disappearing
Many age-old historical centres have been devastated , destroyed by the Israeli occupying forces
In Hebron , the army is preparing to destroy around one hundred houses bordering the prayer route
Hebron is a blatant example of apartheid
The town is separated in two by a large road used only by Israelis , and some streets are entirely forbidden to Palestinians
This is a symbol of a downward spiral that can only lead to an escalation of violence
During the conflict , Palestinian heritage has become a major political issue
Is that not true terrorism , military terrorism , state terrorism ?
Israel is thus clearly showing that a Palestinian identity has no place in its plans to extend the settlements
This idea of eradicating the history and memory of the Palestinian people is a result of the Israeli State 's quest for legitimacy
Through their action on the ground , they are carrying out citizen 's diplomacy where our international diplomacy is unable to intervene
Things really have come to a pretty pass , all as the result of indifference or negligence or fanaticism
A few part-sessions ago we were passing resolutions to protect infrastructures in Palestine , because they were infrastructures built with European Union money
In this sense , we now need to realise that the resolution system is too limited to bring in results
In Copenhagen a few days ago , the European Union showed that it can act decisively and intervene when it has to
We now need to apply a different policy , a different sort of decisiveness , in order to stop this endless , stalemate of a crisis
Today the same is happening on our very doorstep
It is not our job in these circumstances to stand and watch
It is not our job to complain
Our job is to intervene
And an end to terrorist action
We need to keep to the policy decided years ago by Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin , God rest his soul
The@@ rein lies the way forward , therein lies the solution
No other policy makes sense
Having said which , a European Union of the twenty-five which wants to play a political role and intervene in international affairs needs to change its tactics on this issue
It is no good being in the audience
It needs to play the lead role and now it has the chance to play the role which it should have been playing for years
Thank you for listening and Merry Christmas
Madam President , it is with the utmost care that I take the floor once again on the painful issue of the Middle East
Madam President , the destruction of cultural heritage in Hebron is very symbolic
The power of oppression originating from it is not only destroying houses and ston@@ e; it is destroying people and their existence
The State of Israel is op@@ pressing the Palestinian people , with the clearly displayed or hypocritical collusion of all the major powers
The French army is not protecting the population against ethnic and xenophobic kill@@ ings; it is protecting the clique in power that is carrying them out
The rebels are undoubtedly no better , but it is not for the French army to act as arbit@@ er or policeman
By protecting the government in power , it is mainly protecting the French corporations that have major interests there
So yes , the Israeli army should withdraw from Palestine and the French army should leave Côte d' Ivoire and Africa
This time , the world 's protests should be as voci@@ f@@ erous as they were following the barbaric destruction of the Budd@@ ha statues in Afghanistan
The destruction of these cultural trea@@ sures has nothing to do with security and self-defence
More than three hundred homes face destruction
The historic town of Hebron , with its unique architecture and religious importance , will never be the same again
It is a disgrace , and the EU must call upon the world community to accept responsibility for stopping the destruction
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission is deeply concerned about the planned destruction of Palestinian families ' homes in the old town of Hebron
Not only are these buildings of cultural and historical significance , but the planned action will also add further to the suffering of innocent Palestinian civilians
The European Union has condemned the attack by Palestinian militants on 15 November in which 12 Israeli soldiers were killed
The Commission considers that the destruction of historic Palestinian d@@ well@@ ings is in breach of the Hebron Protocol agreed by Israel and the Palestinian Au@@ tonom@@ y Authority in 1997
That protocol commits both parties to preserving and protecting the historic character of the town , so that no part of its heritage is damaged or changed
It called upon Israel as a matter of urgency to reverse its settlement policy , to freeze settlement construction and halt the confiscation of any further land
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at 5
B5-0@@ 6@@ 4@@ 2/@@ 2002 by Mr Andreasen , Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel and Mr Van den Bos on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party on Tibet ,
B5-0@@ 6@@ 5@@ 1/@@ 2002 by Mr van den Berg on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists on the human rights situation for Tibetans in S@@ z@@ ech@@ u@@ an Pro@@ v@@ ince ,
Madam President , Commissioner , we have discussed Tibet many times here in this Chamber
This will certainly not be the last time , either
There is a very great deal of solidarity with the Tibetan people here in the European Parliament
The Tibetan people have for many years been exposed to appalling treatment by Beijing , and this is continuing
There are , however , many more prisoners
I do not believe that this development indicates any fundamental policy change on the part of China
I do not , however , believe that that is the case
It is , at any rate , a step on the way
It is all the more worrying , therefore , that the two Buddhist Tibetans , Ten@@ z@@ in D@@ ele@@ k and Lob@@ san@@ g D@@ hon@@ du@@ p have now been sentenced to death
They were in the wrong place at the wrong time and have now been branded as terrorists
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party demands a fair legal process in accordance with the rule of law and treatment in accordance with international conventions
As always , we condemn the death penalty wherever it is practised
That is not how matters should proceed
The fight against terrorism must always be combined with the rule of law
Tibet is an area with its own culture , its own religion and its own political traditions
It is also a so-called autonomous region in China , however meaningless this autonomy is in practice
Political opponents are simply treated as common criminals
The struggle against terrorism provides yet another excuse for this
The death sentences against Ten@@ z@@ in D@@ ele@@ k , an influential Buddhist lam@@ a , and his assistant , Lob@@ san@@ g D@@ hon@@ du@@ p , pronounced on 3 December , are a sad illustration of this
These death sentences must not be allowed to be carried out; the verdicts must be reviewed on the basis of a fair trial
They pay a great deal of attention to what we think of them , but we must not allow ourselves to be blinded by diver@@ sionary tactics
We must see what is actually happening and bring about change judici@@ ally and in practice
I had gained the impression that a real opening up , a genuine dialogue on human rights was actually going to take place
So I too very much welcomed the release of both N@@ g@@ aw@@ ang S@@ ang@@ dro@@ l and J@@ ig@@ me S@@ ang@@ p@@ o
We regarded that as a sign that pledges were being honoured and promises were being kept
We regarded these as two very positive signs
This is totally contrary to the constitutionality that we naturally expect and demand from a people or from a government
We understand very well that the fight against terrorism is important , but that means combating genuine terrorism , not dissidents
The fight against terrorism must of course also respect constitutional criteria , otherwise it cannot be justified
Madam President , things did indeed get off to a promising start
In September an official delegation from the Dalai Lama visited China 's leaders
In October , the nu@@ n N@@ g@@ aw@@ ang S@@ ang@@ dro@@ l was released after decades of imprisonment , following massive international protests , including those from the European Parliament itself
A considerable number of Members of this House had repeatedly nominated her for the Sakharov Prize
Will the path to constructive dialogue now pe@@ ter out again in the aftermath of the Communist party conference and the far-reaching changes in personnel brought about by it ?
Are the hard@@ liners getting the upper hand ?
We have heard some alarming reports recently
They were accused of owning illegal weapons , of separatism and of taking part in an attack using explo@@ sives carried out in Ch@@ eng@@ du in April
One of those involved is the Tibetan T@@ ul@@ k@@ u Ten@@ z@@ in D@@ ele@@ k , who has a death sentence hanging over him with a two-year reprieve
He has been committed to preserving Tibetan culture , language and religion for decades
He founded new monasteries and championed the social well-being of the public
His colleague Lob@@ san@@ g D@@ hon@@ du@@ p also faces a death penalty , without reprieve
It is evident that neither of the two defendants received a fair trial
International standards were breached
The authorities demanded the payment of bail equivalent to EUR 120 000 before a proper trial could be initiated
His students were arrested when they tried to raise the money
This is a flagrant violation of international human rights
It is imperative for the Chinese authorities to maintain legal standards
It is totally unacceptable for the peaceful struggle to practice Tibetan religion and culture to be treated as an act of terrorism
We must prevent unlawful sentences from being executed and the grant of financial aid must be made dependent on improvements in the area of human rights
The first step must be to lift the death sentence
Madam President , as others have already said , these death sentences have absolutely nothing to do with the war on terrorism
However , that also demonstrates that we have a responsibility to wage that war
The United States also bears that responsibility within the international institutions , the United Nations and under international law
We were talking earlier on about mountain regions
There were even extremist movements in our European democracies
That sounds unlikely today , because by granting autonomy we have ensured that no one takes separatist or terrorist action
We now feel comfortable in the greater community of Europeans and regard ourselves as being at the heart of Europe
' Give the Tibetans autonomy , give them democracy , and give them human rights
That is the way to fight terrorism and separatism
Of course , in comparison with China 's massive population , we are all minorities
However , what we are talking about here is the great Tibetan people with its ancient world culture , which is a valuable heritage for mankind
We appeal to the Chinese to respect this people and its culture as full partners , just as we treat the Tibetans and Chinese as equals
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Posselt is quite right , this is about a Tibetan majority within Tibet
Also , Mrs Maes , the problem raised today by these two death sentences reveals changes in the borders made by the Chinese
The Tibet of the autonomous region is one third of Tibet
There is also the province of S@@ ic@@ hu@@ an , a large proportion of which is part of the historic Tibet
Meanwhile , a small change has taken place in the People 's Republic of China
H@@ u J@@ in@@ ta@@ o has become the new President , the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party
Obviously , Mrs Gebhardt , there could be better signs emerging from this dialogue
I think that we should seriously ask that question
There is a risk of ex@@ o@@ ticism , and a risk that the peaceful struggle of our Tibetan friends will not be capable of achieving the objective of freeing Tibet
This is an objective for the Tibetans , but also for all free men and women across the world
The President of the exiled Tibetan Parliament , Professor Sam@@ d@@ h@@ ong R@@ in@@ po@@ che , has asked for restraint until June
I will restra@@ in myself until June , but I think that from then on we should reconsider our entire approach to supporting the battle to free Tibet
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission welcomes Parliament 's initiative in presenting a resolution on the human rights situation in Tibet
We are deeply concerned about the death sentence passed on Lob@@ san@@ g D@@ hon@@ du@@ p and Ten@@ z@@ in D@@ ele@@ k on 2 December
You may recall that Mr D@@ ele@@ k was on the list of individual cases that we handed to the Chinese authorities under the human rights dialogue between the EU and China
The Commission is also concerned because these death sentences are the first to be passed against Tibetans because of alleged political crimes for some years
Furthermore , the troika reaffirmed that the EU rejects the death penalty and its use in China in general , referring to the ongoing campaign of ' drastic action '
The executions can therefore not be carried out until the People 's Court has re-examined the case
The European Union is also continuing to put pressure on China to guarantee the cultural , linguistic and religious identity of the Tibetan people
Against this background , the Commission is encouraged by the positive news conveyed by the two envoys of the Dalai Lama who visited China in September 2002
We hope that this will be a first step towards the establishment of a more regular dialogue between Beijing and the Dalai Lama
The Commission intends to continue to take only such cooperative measures in Tibet as will directly benefit the Tibetan population
The debate is closed
The vote will take place directly following the debate
We shall now proceed to the vote
Madam President , we suggest that because of the way the debate developed , the title here should be changed
Madam President , I would simply like to say that , in the interests of consistency , the same wording should also be used in Paragraph 7
I therefore request that this should be used throughout the resolution , in the title and in Paragraph 7
That is a good point
Madam President , I am wondering whether you have just held a vote by roll call
My voting card was somewhere else , so I voted too late
Please will you note that I voted in favour ?
We have noted the fact
The vote is concluded
It is a matter of justice that no one should be discriminated against because of their gender or for other reasons
Any form of oppression , discrimination or stereo@@ typing must be combated , and the opportunity of everyone to make free choices promoted
We do not therefore believe that the proposal in the report indicates the right road to go down
We oppose those parts of the report that recommend the adoption of quotas and what is termed positive discrimination
It is not the task of politicians to determine how private employers take their recruitment decisions in the light of these considerations
Ma@@ the@@ matical redistribution does not mean justice and does not lead to genuine equality
S@@ election procedures for recruitment and admission to higher education should , however , ensure gender neutrality as far as possible
We believe that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs should have responsibility for those issues now being dealt with by the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities
We voted in favour of it , of course , because of what it stands for , whilst being aware that it will not actually change anything at all
The European institutions could take strong political measures by making women 's rights a condition for membership of the Union
We wish you , and of course all the staff who have remained with us until this evening , a very Happy Christmas
I would thank you all and wish you a really mer@@ ry Christmas and a happy New Year
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned
( The sitting was closed at 5
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday 19 December 2002
I must apologise for the late arrival of Mr Pat Cox , our President , but he is currently on his way rather slowly from Frankfurt
The House will recall his four years as President of the European Commission
During his ste@@ war@@ d@@ ship he launched the European Monetary System , the fore@@ run@@ ner of the single currency
He was an outstanding and committed European and statesman , and I invite the House to observe one minute 's silence in his memory
For the first time in the history of this particular Parliament an alternative resolution to the S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel report on fundamental rights is being proposed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro
Mr Ribeiro e Castro unfortunately cannot be here because of the weather conditions , since he has had problems travelling here
But I want to request that the S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel report be postponed to a later date
You are too late to change today 's agenda
That should have been notified by 4 p
I will just clarify for the House that you are proposing that North Korea be taken in the second part-session this month
In the event of further discussion of this issue becoming necessary , we will sort that out at a future date
We are therefore against the topic of North Korea being removed from the list of topical and urgent matters for debate
in Europe we are abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ists and this is an issue which is even proposed as one of the Copenhagen conditions
Mr President , I am delighted with the support we have received from Mr Barón Crespo and the PSE Group
I can assure you that my group is deeply concerned about the situation in Chechnya and it is something which must command the attention of this House
However , it is something on which we have frequently expressed ourselves and there is no particular urgency
The action of the Governor of the State of Il@@ lin@@ o@@ is in the United States is something we very much welcome
It is for that reason that we maintain our request for an urgency on this subject
As Mr Barón Crespo has already expressed his opposition to the deletion of Chechnya from the agenda , I will not speak further on the subject
I am very much in favour of our also discussing Chechnya
Whilst being friendly towards America , we very definitely oppose the death penalty
Mr President , I fully agree with Mr Barón Crespo 's proposal and Mr Poettering 's clarifications
I would simply like to say to Mr Watson that one minor event is actually due to take place in his own country
At the end of this month , a British court will have to rule on the request for the extradition of the C@@ he@@ tch@@ en Deputy Prime Minister
I consider that to be anything but insignificant , and I am amazed that the President , who ha@@ ils from Britain , has forgotten about it
On the subject of the death penalty , I would like , if I may , to ask the President to send another letter
This case concerns some bad news - 26 Congolese people have been sentenced to death for the assassination of Laurent Kabila
That is hardly a matter for the agenda
It should be raised at another time
We will , however , take note of your comments
Mr President , I feel it is extremely important that we speak out on serious matters which do not depend directly on the policy of the Member States
We have learnt something , however , since the agenda was drawn up
We have learnt that the British Government is taking part , almost on a daily basis , in aer@@ ial attacks on Iraq
I believe this is a matter of great importance that should be of interest to Parliament
The American Government , however , has admitted that the United Kingdom took part in aer@@ ial attacks in Al Qa@@ sid@@ i , Al K@@ ut , Al Bas@@ ra@@ h , ?
You are beginning to get into a very political matter
We are dealing with the agenda
I will inform you , if you listen , that the Iraq question will be debated at the Brussels part-session , at the end of January
You will have the opportunity to raise the matter then
Mr President , I would like to start by telling Mr Posselt that my group voted against reducing the number of topical and urgent debates
Moreover , I believe that it was practically the only group to do so , for his group certainly acted differently
This is why we asked for the item to be included on the agenda of the Brussels part-session
We now come to the one-@@ minute speeches on matters of political importance
The information brochure from our very own Parliament is being attacked by the chemical industry , by CE@@ FI@@ C
I have heard that our own President , Mr Cox , has decided to stop distributing this brochure , which is called Tr@@ oub@@ led Wat@@ ers
That is something we must not do
It is an information brochure and a com@@ ic strip
I have the brochure here , and everyone can see that it is a com@@ ic strip and therefore fic@@ tional
I understand that the document has not been withdrawn
It will be made available in all languages to colleagues in the House
We have enshrined European human rights in the Treaties , and human dignity in the Charter , and regard these things as binding throughout the world
This scandal in Du@@ ba@@ i , Mr President , makes it necessary that this be pointed out
I will make sure that is passed on to the President
Mr President , the news in recent weeks that initiatives to clone human beings are taking place in different parts of the world is very disturbing indeed
I very much welcome the support that has been given by the European Parliament and the European Commission to promote a worldwide ban on human cloning
We need to implement the necessary measures to stop those seeking to clone human beings in their tracks
It is an abhorrent and unethical practice which is totally irresponsible from a scientific point of view
We need to implement a worldwide convention which will ban human cloning within the next few months
The international community must act on this issue immediately
Only last November the European Parliament voted in favour of a proposal which I tabled calling for a universal ban on the cloning of human beings
We must work now towards achieving this objective via the structures of the United Nations
I would call on this Parliament and on your good offices , Mr President , to forward that immediately as a matter of urgency
This should therefore be an occasion to celebrate
You mentioned Ro@@ y Jen@@ kins in your opening remarks
He , with the late John Smith , was responsible on the Labour side for ensuring that Britain became and remained a member of the European Union
Mr Titley , I am sure you are much more eloquent in these matters than I would be
I am referring here specifically to the attitude of the Portuguese Government to the Andalu@@ sian fishermen
I would appeal for san@@ ity and responsibility in order to find a solution to a problem we have had for decades
Mr President , I represent an Atlantic coastal region in France , and therefore in Europe , which has just been affected by the pollution from the Prestige
I consequently believe that Parliament should accept the committee of inquiry that it previously rejected
Secondly , I believe we must decide what to do with the wreck
We cannot leave thousands of fishermen and shell@@ fish-@@ ga@@ there@@ rs as well as workers in the tourism sector , waiting around indefinitely , without proposing an industrial solution
That matter should and will be referred to the Conference of Presidents
And as far as I know , for my country and region at least , these are s@@ wa@@ thing cuts
As far as I am concerned , this is not just out of order; there is also a moral dimension to this issue
If the Bureau and the Quaestors wish to reduce planned expenditure , they should not tell us at the eleventh hour because we have already made other plans
I am sure a number of colleagues would express similar concerns
I can assure you that the College of Quaestors will look into the matter and will possibly come forward with new proposals
The existing arrangements , however , will stay in place until that change is actually made
Your visitors from Greece will be adequately covered
Thirty or so members of a neo-@@ naz@@ i organisation burst into a local television stu@@ di@@ o where a debate was being held and brutally attacked a representative of an Islamic community
The fact that this person was expressing very dubious , extremely provocative views did not , of course , prevent all the democratic groupings from condemning this very disturbing incident
You will understand , Mr President , that , henceforth , it will be extremely difficult for me to stay in this House if Mr Bor@@ gh@@ e@@ zio takes the floor
Mr President , I would like you to ask the Commission what measures it intends to take to demand the reimbursement of the subsidies granted to the Da@@ e@@ wo@@ o corporation
Once the money has been received , how many of these companies cut jobs , or even close factories , thereby ruining whole towns and even regions
They are all under 25 years of age
None have criminal records
This is one more example of the mediaeval methods used by Iran
I would ask you to approach the Iranian Government and , if appropriate , break off the critical dialogue until such methods are no longer used
This is a matter of great urgency
Mr President , please allow me to add something to what Mrs Gebhardt has said
The things she has described have made a deep impression on me , but , Mrs Gebhardt , there was just one thing missing
The reason why these violations of human rights outrage us is that a European woman is involved
We should , though , be aware that Muslim women - and not only in Du@@ ba@@ i - are exposed to the same violations of human rights on a daily basis
We will make sure the President draws the correct conclusions from that and takes appropriate action
We will refer that matter to the President
Mr President , a while ago , one Member quite rightly condemned cloning in this plenary and called for it to be universally rejected
What he failed to do , however , was to make a proper distinction between reproductive cloning and therapeutic cloning
With regard to reproductive cloning , I am sure we all agree that this is an inhuman or de@@ hum@@ anis@@ ing technique that must be rejected
The same cannot be said , however , for therapeutic cloning
A way must be left open for science , scientists and the scientific community to experiment in innovative fields that have enormous potential for medicine
The dogmatic individuals who are opposed to any type of cloning are the staun@@ chest allies of those who would allow secrecy , char@@ lat@@ anism and trafficking to flourish in this field
That concludes the item
The reasons for this initiative and its goals are not difficult to understand
The regional and local authorities have taken on a more important role in transposing Community legislation within the individual States and in running Community programmes
They should therefore feel involved in the preparatory work on the Union 's policies and acts too
In this regard , I would like to stress the criteria I adopted as rapporteur
Firstly , we need to consider all the autonomous territorial entities which operate within the Member States as a single unit
I have therefore not proposed in my draft report to sub@@ divide regions or local authorities into different categories
In conclusion , I trust that the Members will reflect on the points I have made and that there will be broad consensus in tomorrow 's votes
There will be cultural and political diversity , but also territorial diversity
As he said , we shall hold a sitting specifically devoted to this subject within the Convention on 6 and 7 February
It is therefore with this restriction in mind that the Commission is able to approve the main points of the report presented
We are in favour of a more prominent role for the Committee of the Regions provided that the interinstitutional balance remains as it is today
The Committee 's right to recourse to the Court of Justice deserves consideration , if necessary , in order to defend respect for the principle of subsidiarity
We are in favour of what your report calls ' new participatory methods ' so that regional and local authorities might be more directly involved in Community procedures
We are in favour of adapting the implementation of EU legislation to take account of individual local circumstances and needs
The Commission will thus try out a pilot scheme of tripartite contracts , involving Brussels , the national capital and the region
Above and beyond this , generally speaking , the Treaty already provides us with plenty of room for manoeuvre through framework legislation
The three institutions responsible for legislative activity share responsibility for preventing these framework laws from entering into too much detail
We must , however , take care to preserve the uniform , and therefore equal or fair , application of European law
We must not weaken the rules we adopt here , through democratic debate , by allowing the territorial authorities vari@@ ab@@ le-@@ geometry application , even on an exceptional basis
I have talked about what happens initially , when drawing up Community texts , and what happens downstream , when they are implemented
It concerns the opportunity for certain regions alone , those with legislative powers , to defend their rights before the Court of Justice
Furthermore , I spoke very frankly to these regions with legislative powers a few weeks ago in Florence , at one of their meetings
I believe it is neither realistic nor desirable to establish this kind of distinction between European territorial authorities
For example , how can we confer important , individual rights on these regions , while not all the current and future Member States are organised in this way ?
Our institutional system must not favour one system over another
Regions with legislative powers , however , which have their own responsibilities , are facing difficulties that we do not want to ignore
Why should access to Community justice not follow this example , or at least its spirit ?
This would consist of giving each State clear responsibility for taking cases to the Court of Justice on behalf of these territorial authorities
Ladies and gentlemen , we are not trying to pit the regions against the States or against Europe , or even less so the States against Europe
We are trying to choose a culture of cooperation rather than maintaining a culture of confrontation
The regions must be able to count on the Member States to obtain genuine political and legal representation within the Union
The regions must be able to count on the European Union to involve them systematically in all stages of the European decision-making process
It must be able to count on their contributions to the debate on European democracy
Recent years have seen an increased awareness of what the Member States ' various regional and local authorities do , and of their autonomous nature
As it is in the regions that the EU 's grass-roots democracy does its work , it is obvious that the regions have to be involved in European policies
Democracy works only when everyone is involved , and that means women and men equally
The European Union 's regions are significantly handicapped in their cohesion and in their development as democracies by the continuing under-representation of women in decision-making processes
It is vital to work towards the development of new social policies , and this includes , in particular , assessing support for equal treatment and its implementation
This report must therefore form the basis of that debate
I would like to congratulate the Chairman , Mr Napolitano , on the good sense , which is the least common of the senses , of his proposal
Mr President , in this case you have done justice to your talent and reputation
Our European Union is not just a union of states , it is a union of citizens
The Treaties have always conferred certain rights directly on citizens and therefore on the way that citizens are governed within Member States
It is right that we should look at how our regions are involved in the running of this Union
What rights should we give to our regions ?
What responsibilities should we give them in the Treaties ?
Nonetheless the Union must recognise the fact that many of our Member States are organised internally in a way that gives substantial responsibilities to regions and other sub@@ national authorities
On all these issues there is consensus
On the one hand there is an argument to say that they too should be able to defend their prerogatives
My group is offering a compromise on this question
Regions should be able to bring a case either via their national governments or via the Committee of the Regions
The committee would therefore be a sort of filter
It would check what level of support there would be for a court case
I commend our amendment on this point to the House
We appreciate that such a direct relationship post@@ ul@@ ates the federal nature of the integration process in a fairly dramatic form
It is appropriate that the treaty provisions on subsidiarity should be re@@ formulated to reflect this
Liberals believe decentralisation is essential if the Union is to manage its common policies more effectively
More of a relationship with provincial politics will improve the quality of our supranational democracy
This report provides many of the answers , but the issue of the approach to the Court of Justice is still controversial
The Liberal Group wishes to improve access across the board for the citizen , to improve citizens ' approach to their constitutional court
This implies clear lines of approach for all democratic representative bodies , especially regional authorities with parliamentary powers of law-making independent of their Member States
Mr President , I am sorry that , because my train was delayed , I have only just arrived and have not therefore been able to hear the previous debate
I have asked to take the floor because , last year , I was rapporteur for a report dealing with the local dimension of the European Employment Strategy
I believe , in spite of everything , that the national democracies themselves form the democratic basis for the European project
I therefore believe that this local and regional development should take place within the framework of these national democracies
The nations , and above all their governments and parliaments , must be the link between the local , regional and European levels
To circumvent the national level would be completely reprehensible
It could not lead to anything other than a weakening of European democracy , and that is something which none of us could wish to see
Mr President , I also want to express my gratitude and satisfaction that the Parliament is today debating this report on an initiative which came from Mr Napolitano himself
No doubt that will be where the votes will be concentrated on Wednesday
However , it is a matter of common consensus that democracy in the European Union is necessarily democracy at many levels
There are other points that have been raised which we think are vital as well
The regional authorities should on occasion be able to take matters to the Court of Justice
Why should it be left to the fishing people to test that ?
Why cannot the regional authority responsible for enforcing the law test it itself ?
Many other such examples spr@@ int to mind
There should also be opportunities to take things into account during the legislative process and before it
The EFA parties which I represent here do not just represent regions
Of course the countries we represent are regions in the technical constitutional sense
Often we forget the role and relevance of local and regional government
It is the closest level of governance to the people of the regions
It implements many of the policies and legislative processes agreed by the European Union
A prime example of this , in the Irish context , is environmental legislation
We should therefore enhance the role of regional and local government in responding to and developing European policy
It is my belief that the European Charter for Local Self-@@ Government has many merits
It commits the parties to applying basic rules guaranteeing the political , administrative and financial independence of local authorities
Consequently , the Charter considers that public responsibilities should be exercised by the authorities closest to the citizens
In many cases these are the local and regional authorities
It is by embracing our cultural and linguistic diversity that we enhance the understanding of Europe , its diverse peoples and its many different regions
L@@ ingu@@ istic and cultural diversity is not about defining or redefining bound@@ ari@@ es; it underpins the cultural strength of our enlarging European Union
It is my belief that the work of the European Committee of the Regions is important
It has become more focused in its opinions and it has to be further recognised
A region is not about its boundaries , it is about its cultures and its languages , and , even more so , it is about its people
Mr President , if I a@@ x my mates back home where they come from , they would say Dev@@ on
Not Cor@@ n@@ wall , across the river Tam@@ ar , which is foreign parts , nor Z@@ um@@ mer@@ z@@ et where all they to@@ ffs live
That 's too close to L@@ un@@ non for my liking
They 'm even going to throw in they fol@@ ks up to G@@ lou@@ ce@@ ster@@ shire and other foreign parts
We 'm are all going to be part of the south west region
That is going to bring Europe much closer to our citizens , so we will be all right then , w@@ o n't us ? '
This cha@@ p Gi@@ or@@ gi@@ o Napolitano says we can then be an autonomous territorial entity
Then the likes of me can be on the Committee of the Regions which has recently affirmed its exclusive legitimacy as an institutional discussion partner
' says my m@@ ate
That is the reality of bringing Europe closer to the people
It is a price not worth paying
It is difficult to imagine the European Union maintaining direct relations with 250 regions or more , or listening to all their opinions
In any case , national identity and the peoples ' right to organise themselves as they see fit must be respected completely
The European Union has no supreme power to intervene in these matters
The many amendments tabled here and in committee testify to the topic 's capacity to engage our emotions
Whilst the EU is being enlarged , that process also demands internal integration
This gives these local structures crucial importance when it comes to impar@@ ting the tradition of European thought and implementing European legislation in practice and on a day-to-day basis
The fact is , though , that the Member States ' constitutional arrangements also differ to an extremely wide degree
It is not intended that Europe should tam@@ per with this autonomous approach to national structures , which has the deepest of roots in the nation state
Ladies and gentlemen , it is the European Parliament that , alone , possesses the power to integrate Europe
We , its Members , represent the people for whom ' home ' means their regions and their communities
Mr President , the future European Constitution must lead to a more democratic and effective Union , that is , one that is closer to the citizens and their concerns
In this regard , the role of the regions is quite simply essential
What the Convention must do is formalise something which is already a reality
How is it possible that the regions are applying Community legislation and that this is not formally recognised in terms of rights within the institutional framework of the Union ?
How is it possible that these regions transpose Community legislation but their situation is clearly undervalued in the Treaties in force ?
If somebody has to apply and transpose legislation in accordance with this principle , then logically they must also be able to defend their prerogatives and rights
Also in the European Union the courts are there to ensure the better legal operation of the institutions and policies we have decided on jointly
The Spanish Socialists voted in favour of the Napolitano report in committee and we will do so again tomorrow because it represents a step forward
What will be approved will probably be somewhere in the middle
Indeed , it is the territorial authorities - the regional and local authorities - alone which give substance to the democracy of proximity
It is they that make it possible to strengthen the roots of genuine democracy and to bring the citizens closer to the institutions , including the European institutions
The Convention is the forum which has been assigned the task of resolving this thorny issue
It started off focusing its attention solely on the first level of subsidiarity , the subsidiarity between the Union and the States
My hope is that the Convention will succeed in recognising and endorsing the right to local and regional autonomy
It may be that the idea of strengthening the link through the Committee of the Regions is the solution we all need
Mr President , it is not only dictatorships that traditionally evoke resistance from many of their inhabit@@ ant@@ s; centralised states and multiethnic states do so as well
Centr@@ alisation means arrogant governments that think they know better than the people who are experiencing the regional problems and who choose solutions for them themselves
Democratic government in Europe cannot exist if cultural diversity and regional differences are not taken into account
The existence of the European Union is resulting in the power of the governments of the Member States growing in comparison with their national parliaments and their regions
Moreover , I feel that the compromise put forward has two major shortcomings , for it proposes two filters , two filters which are themselves inadequate
This equality cannot exist because the regions have different powers , and that is just as it should be
Serbia and Montenegro are using the principle of self-determination to try to reach a definitive settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia
The European Union itself , on the contrary , lacks a comprehensive approach to the issue of stateless nations
That means that those stateless nations cannot claim the right of their peoples to exist as such
How can the European Union ignore the principles of universality , indi@@ visibility and interdependence of human rights proclaimed in 1993 by the Vienna Declaration ?
Could that be possible in an area of freedom , security and justice ?
Self-@@ determination is the key to peaceful relations between nations because self-determination equals democracy
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Napolitano report addresses one of the most controversial issues facing the Convention
I believe it is right for the proposal on the Union 's powers not to interfere with the systems of the individual States
Europe 's roots lie at local and regional level
That is where the European lives and work@@ s; that is where most of the policies that we make in Europe are carried out
I think that Mr Napolitano has made a number of very good proposals for improving the involvement of regional and local entities in the European policy process
The rapporteur says that there is no need to establish differences between the various regions
But in his country there are still regions a statu@@ to speci@@ ale , which have different prerogatives
Today in Europe there are certain regions with legislative powers which are genuinely Stat@@ eless nations , such as Catalonia , or , as the next speaker will surely say
Finally , cross-border cooperation is also an essential element in European construction , and we are pleased that the Napolitano report recognises this
Mr President , Commissioner , I am saying nothing new when I insist that diversity is one of the characteristic principles of the united Europe we are building
In our Union there are still many deficiencies which we must clear up
These constitutional entities must be empowered to bring cases before the Court of Justice if Community decisions encroach upon or undermine their competences
And it cannot be said that there are too many regions , since there are not so many entities with exclusive legislative powers
I do not agree with those people who have said that this is a responsibility of each Member State , which is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity
The Napolitano report attempts to define the role of local and regional powers in the Union 's decision-making process
Mr President , there are many areas in which the Convention is meant to move European policy into a new stage
This topic , the position of the municipalities and regions and their involvement in European policy , is one of them
It is my belief that both local self-@@ government and regional identity are fundamental principles , and must be reflected as such in the European constitution
I also wish to thank Mr Napolitano , whose task was a difficult one in view of the concepts involved being very much a matter of dispute
To that , we all say ' yes ' , yet there is division in this House when it comes to the regions
I think that further thought needs to be given to this
This diversity must also be reflected when it comes to the right to appeal to the Court of Justice
Commissioner Barnier has proposed the application of Article 20@@ 3 in the event of us not succeeding in this
That may perhaps be a way ahead , albeit only the second best
It may be that a further stage is needed to enable us to find the best way forward
There is something else of great importance that I would like to mention
Commissioner Barnier , you have been to the border region that is my home
Re@@ ality has already burst the bounds of the legal framework , and to a substantial extent
That is what European added value actually amounts to
There must be room in the constitution for this sort of statute on cross-border cooperation , which will then benefit many millions of people
I hope that a large majority will endorse the Napolitano report
Rather than being in competition with them , Parliament exists to be the regions ' and municipalities ' natural partner
Mr President , ' The states are the skele@@ ton of Europe , and the regions its flesh and blood '
That is the view expressed by the Catal@@ onian President , Mr Pu@@ jo@@ l
Moreover , it is regional and local authorities that implement a large portion of EU decisions
It is therefore only fair that they should be given a strengthened role to play now that we are reviewing European forms of governance
These bodies must be involved at an early stage in some form of consultation procedure when proposals are formulated
It would therefore be excellent to incorporate , for example , the statute on local and regional authorities
I should like there to be as few changes as possible to this report
I am convinced that it will form an excellent basis for discussion in , for example , the Convention
There are even signs of a counter@@ move in the European Convention now
The draft constitutional treaty put forward by Valéry Giscard d' Estaing causes me great concern in this regard
It does not contain any references at all to sub-@@ state governments and is a step backwards in many respects
All this is happening against the background of enlargement
Many of the states that will soon be acceding are smaller than the existing regions and nations with legislative powers
The candidate Member States will soon be participating fully in the European structure
It is therefore only fair that nations such as Flanders , the Wal@@ lo@@ on provinces , the Basque country , Catalonia , Wales , Scotland and Galicia can do that too
The report by Mr Napolitano has arrived at an opportune moment , a few weeks before the debate on this in the Convention on 6 and 7 February
I fully support the strengthened version of the Napolitano report that Mr MacCormick mentioned
Commissioner Barnier and Mr Méndez de Vigo have just commented on the proposal to offer constitutional regions direct access to the Court of Justice
If I understand correctly , they are arguing for controlled access under the authority of the Member State in question
This little trick , however , is rather too transparent
As far as the regions ' right of appeal is concerned , I am glad that we have already come to an understanding about so much
We have agreed that the situation demands that the regions should have the option of laying claims before the European Court of Justice
We are also as one in believing that , on the other hand , the Member States must have some sort of monitoring role in this
In practice , this means that all that remains to be decided is what the role of the Member States is to be
The fact is that the regions can of course do that already
This would leave room for flexible solutions in all the Member States , solutions that might be different in Germany from what they are in Great Britain
For this reason , I really do beg you to reconsider this
The European Union should not interfere in any way with the territorial organisation of its Member States
Furthermore , the Member States are completely free to organise , each for their own part , the participation of the regions in their decision-making processes
It should be the role of the Committee of the Regions to consult the regions at Community level and defend their interests
This process should also apply to monitoring the principle of subsidiarity
Contrary to what Mr Wuermeling has just said , the Committee of the Regions did not until now have the right to involve the Court
Any other solution would inevitably lead to an inactive and ineffective Union
Yet , although it is not an easy issue to resolve , the rapporteur addresses it in a commendably balanced , not to say quite pragmatic way
Thus , a sort of grey area has been created , there have been injustices , if we consider what has happened in recent years
We have witnessed a process of Europe@@ anisation of powers conferred on the regions by Constitu@@ tions
We have witnessed a complete lack or only relative participation of the regions in the Community decision-making processes
We have witnessed the transfer of responsibilities from the States to the Community and thus the loss of the interactive powers conferred on the regions by national Constitu@@ tions
The Länder participate in the federal legislative process through the Bundes@@ r@@ at and the Italian regions have powers of initiative at national level
Then the regions are further penalised in that they no longer have any guarantees as regards jurisdictional protection in the event of encro@@ ach@@ ment on their competences
I feel that the Napolitano report endeavours to provide a very interesting legal response to all these concerns
It is the basis for a debate which will take place formally in the Convention , probably at the beginning of February
Mr President , we are all familiar with the historic en@@ treaty ' Si@@ re , grant us the freedom to think
Today , and when voting on the Napolitano report , we would have to amend that and say , ' Si@@ re , grant us the freedom to vote
But who is the ' Si@@ re ' in this instance ?
It is not of course by chance that , happily , no compromise motion has so far been tabled by those who have again been away pon@@ dering these matters
' Si@@ re , grant us the freedom to vote
' - there is no democracy without transparency and voting that is open and fair
Commissioner , Mr President , I would like to speak out in favour of the equality of the regions with each other
Even if some have legislative competence , this would not give them greater or additional rights in relation to other regions
Otherwise , we would be establishing two-speed citizenship with first - and second-class Europeans
It falls to each State to give power to its regions if it wishes to do so
The matter is being debated in many of our countries , and in particular in my country , France , but not only there
It falls to each State to consult its local authorities and its regions within the context of European policies and their transposal
The Member States do not necessarily do this well , and could do better , but this is a good start
I would point out that the European Union is not the sum of its regions
It is a Union of States and peoples
Each State must remain master of its internal organisation , both at institutional and territorial level
That is laid down in the Treaties in their current wording and we must retain both the spirit and the letter of the Treaties
No country can claim to have a better system than another
No country can impose its system on another
Europe is a contract , not a constraint
Mr MacCormick has the floor for a point of order
Just for confirmation , according to the final draft agenda , the vote is not tomorrow as Mr Méndez de Vigo implied , but on Wednesday
It has been changed back to tomorrow ?
Right , we need Amendment No 24 very quickly then
Yes , Mr MacCormick , because according to my information , the plen@@ um of this Parliament has decided that the vote will take place tomorrow
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
There are two problems causing this
Secondly , until recently it was unclear which human rights these reports were actually supposed to be about
What is the yard@@ stic@@ k@@ ; what are the terms of reference ?
In the past , various rapporteurs have made their own selec@@ tions from the problems , and that has not always benefited continuity and credibility
The European Parliament 's control function is of a political and not a legal nature , however
For the purpose of these annual reports , therefore , we must view the Charter as a political reference framework , a sort of table of contents
Human rights are universal , indivisible and interrelated
The human rights discourse is by definition global
The European Union 's human rights policy is therefore only credible if human rights violations at home are measured against the same yardsticks as failings elsewhere in the world
The European Parliament speaks out against specific human rights problems elsewhere at every session , and correctly places great store on human rights in discussions about the candidate countries
We must , however , take an honest look at ourselves as well
That is why I have consciously chosen the naming and sha@@ ming approach in my report
The European Union is a community of values
We hear that ad nause@@ am
What are the main human rights problems in the European Union ?
I name some of them and I pose a number of specific questions relating to them
First and foremost , there is the risk of civil rights being compromised in the regrettably necessary fight against terrorism
It is therefore important to couple specific legislation with a sunset clause and to list and evaluate these anti-terrorism measures
are the Commission and the Council willing to list and evaluate them in this way ?
Internal correction mechanisms are not particularly effective
will the Commission investigate the opportunities for doing so ?
I would like to see a coherent and uniform European strategy of equal treatment
will the Commission take the lead in this ?
We need to clarify how these treaty obligations in the social sphere relate to the same Member States ' obligations under secondary Community legislation
will the Commission take the lead in this as well ?
The Commission and Parliament itself should in fact also be able to answer this question
If you would allow me to make a final comment on Mr Ribeiro e Castro 's alternative draft proposal , I must say that I find it rather fun@@ ny
You would have to be a true optimist to put forward that proposal
Anyone who supports this resolution obviously wants to shut their eyes to reality
It is a nice example of wishful thinking , but it is too good to be true
This is the task of the Network of Experts on Fundamental Rights
This network will enable both Parliament and the Commission to remain vigilant and to ensure that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is complied with and given due consideration
The European Union is an area of freedom , security and justice which fails to provide a rigorous protection of fundamental rights
At the same time , however , a pragmatic and effective assessment must be made of the quality of protection of fundamental rights
I therefore believe some humility was needed to accomplish this painstaking task
There are other means of action , resolutions , on occasion , directives , etc
We can also call a new Convention , as I have just said
We can also protest in our own countries since each Member State is free to go beyond the minimum standard constituted by the Charter of Fundamental Rights
I ab@@ h@@ or this , because by acting in this way , it has accepted things that are not found in any programme of any socialist party in any country
Mr President , in brief conclusion , I would like to express my regret
This has historically been a conflic@@ tive report , to the shame of this Parliament
The charter should be a good instrument for measuring them
We are moving in the right direction , formulas are developing so that we can work jointly with the Commission
While this is happening , while we are evolving , we should have the generosity to do it together and to do it well
I would point out to Mr Cornillet that this report has always been controversial
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party supports Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel 's report
We think that the report provides an important and useful survey of the situation regarding fundamental rights within our own European Union
Certainly , the issue can be raised of the scope of the report as regards both choice of subjects and political content
We can also dispute a number of the wordings and examples , but I believe we can probably learn from the work in time for next year 's report
We do not therefore agree with the basic criticism made of the report
We require many other countries to comply with the demands concerning fundamental rights
That is why it is all the more important for us to examine what kind of order our own house is in
It is good to look elsewhere , but sometimes it is good to look at one 's own situation
Unfortunately , there are all too many indications in this report that the situation could have been significantly better in our own countries
We all agree about the importance of doing everything in our power to combat those who would use violence and terrorism to damage the foundations of our society
There is of course a broad consensus on this issue
There is perhaps , however , cause to stand up and ask ourselves whether the end always justifies the means
The question deserves to be asked
We Liberals also welcome open discussion of the inadequate conditions in many EU prisons , as well as of action by the police
It is my conviction that the democratic institutions are sufficiently robust to cope successfully with such a discussion
Our democracy is also strong enough to enable its expedi@@ ents to be discussed openly
My own country too is criticised in this report
Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel 's report is important , and it is important that the debate on racism , xenophobia and anti-Semitism be conducted here in Parliament
Let us not therefore turn the discussion into an internal and national affair
It is about something much larger
Allow me in conclusion to emphasise asylum and refugee policy within the European Union
Many crimes against fundamental rights have taken place , and continue to take place , in these spheres
In particular , the children of refugees have a bad time of it , something which should cause all governments to feel ashamed
If we cannot agree on anything else , we ought in any case in this Assembly to be able to agree that all children require additional protection
Opinion forming is important
Let us perhaps look at what happened at the weekend in the United States as evidence of the fact that opinion forming can in actual fact also be effective
We have amendments by the ELDR Group on the subjects of family relations and the concept of the family
These are by way of clarification
I will only comment on certain aspects , Mr President , given the time available
The UNHCR also expresses its concern at the increasing tendency to link asylum seekers to possible crime and terrorism , particularly following 11 September
I believe that a common asylum and immigration policy that respects human rights is essential , as the rapporteur also points out
The repercussions of anti-terrorist measures on the Rule of Law and human rights should be assessed , above all in terms of the rights of asylum seekers and immigrants
Mr President , every day in Spain we see a horrendous tragedy involving people who come looking for a better life
I do not understand the proposals of some Members of this house which discredit the essential nature of this report
Mr President , my group certainly welcomes this report and will not be supporting the alternative resolution
We are critical about the human rights records of other governments , but seem very unwilling to criticise when it comes to the European Union itself
I want to pick out some examples , such as the treatment of the Roma people
My country sees no problem in sending the Roma back to their countries of origin
It threatens to break up families
And yet we have criticised accession countries heavily for their treatment of the Roma people
Mention has already been made of the asylum issue
When you read the comments in the explanatory statement , about my own Member State and others , many of them are critical
The UK Government , for example , recently introduced a human rights act
All proposed legislation is to be bench@@ marked against that act
Yet virtually everything that comes through is stamped as being fully compatible , even though it is obviously not
Mr President , as Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel said in a Dutch newspaper , if Europe imposes stricter standards on others than it does on itself it will lose credibility
Indeed , we should take a good look at ourselves before we point a finger at others
In the light of the situation the world is in , however , this statement is a long way from reality
I do not want to play down the violations of human rights in EU Member States
We need to remain vigilant so that the relatively good human rights situation in the EU does not deteriorate
In Pakistan people are being sentenced to death for belonging to a religion
This kind of occurrence cannot be compared with the others
At present , the reality is that Europe is imposing stricter standards on itself than on others
The very suggestion that it might be the other way round makes us lose credibility in the eyes of the outside world
The S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel report ple@@ ads for a clear framework , preferably a constitution , as we would otherwise not be able to arrive at an independent , unambiguous assessment
In fact , this report reveals a clear political colour and the ' values and standards ' tag that goes with it
A constitution of our own would be undesirable and unnecessary
The EU consists of solid nation states with their own perfectly good constitutions
These are contained in an existing democratic order with a process of judicial review and an involved civilian population
If the European Union were to get a constitution of its own , this would at most be able to supplement the national Member States ' own constitutions
What is more , in Europe we have the excellent ECHR and the Court associated with it
So now we are supposed to go and review ourselves when the need arises ?
Europe is a community of values , not only an economic community , as Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel rightly says
The review framework and the review process already exist
We do not need a politically tinted report from the European Parliament or a European constitution for that
Well , it seems that not everybody enjoys this freedom
What crime has Mr Plan@@ tin committed ?
He ed@@ ited a jour@@ nal
A jour@@ nal that does no harm to anyone
I cannot accept that histor@@ ians today might be imprisoned , as in other European countries , for their ideas , their beliefs and their analyses
This situation is absolutely intolerable , as is the withdrawal of the university degrees awarded to Jean Plan@@ tin over ten years ago
This unacceptable situation must not be allowed to continue
Mr President , the protection of fundamental rights is undoubtedly one of the driving forces of the current evolution of the European Union
Nevertheless , I must unfortunately acknowledge that this has not been the situation , quite the opposite
Mr President , first of all I would like to apologise to the rapporteur that I was unable to be here at the beginning
I have only just arrived in the Parliament because of delays
I welcome the fact that we are able to have a debate on the fundamental rights within the European Union
This is not an easy situation
We need to work towards a common European asylum policy
The report contains references to prison facilities in the United Kingdom and indeed in other Member States
However , it is very difficult to spend huge amounts of money on prisons when there are demands from other areas
The same is true of the police service , and the British police take seriously any allegations of malpractice or racism by police officers
Mr Cornillet was himself a distinguished previous rapporteur
Human rights issues are intensely political but it is a pity when they become the subject of partisan divisions
We are certainly not opposed to this in principle , but this really is a matter for national decision , as in the Netherlands
Why , then , does the report not propose to fight those who impose these unacceptable conditions of exploitation ?
Why does it not propose to fight the governments who deprive migrants of fundamental rights ?
You speak of rights and freedoms
For the most impoverished , however , and even for the working-class majority of the population , these are hollow words
In this society , which is based on trade , money confers all the rights , including the right to crush the rights and freedoms of others
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel for her excellent work or , at least , what we believe to be excellent work
Of the many issues raised in the report , as this debate shows , there are two which are particularly important and sensitive
In this regard , there are already people in the United States who would like to see torture legally introduced
The other issue which the rapporteur has courageously highlighted is the recognition of same-sex marriages
In our opinion , we also need to enshrine in legislation the individual 's right to freedom in a broad sense , which is true freedom
As other Members have pointed out , it will be necessary to pay greater attention to the Commission and the Council 's work in the area of human rights
To put it more simply , the principle of respect for human rights and the safeguarding of human rights are wholly theoretical
Viol@@ ations in Italy continue to be very frequent
The Italian Prime Minister himself , Sil@@ vio Berlusconi , has declared this law to be illiberal but necessary
We will discuss this matter another time , however
Meanwhile , the radical Members will vote wholeheartedly for Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel 's report
Commissioner , you described this report as very wide-ranging and ambitious
I will take these two adjec@@ tives as the basis for a number of minor points for reflection
It is certainly wide-ranging - too wide-ranging in terms of the issues addressed
It is not ambitious enough in its conclusions , which are limited to a few political objectives - the same objectives as always
The judges and police officers of some of the Member States are described as torturers , accused of beating up innocent people
Mr President , in drafting her report , my colleague , Mrs Jo@@ ke S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel , has chosen a very exacting working method
She levels her criticisms regarding failures in the area of human rights directly at countries that are mentioned by name
Unfortunately , this has not entirely been the case here
Item 27 gives the read@@ er the idea that there is no viable alternative to military service in Finland
In it , Finland and Greece are called on to recognise the right of conscientious objection to military service without restriction and without reference to any religious grounds
There has been such a right in existence in Finland , however , since 19@@ 31
Under the law at present anyone obliged to do military service can in practice choose a non-military form of service
Every year approximately 2 500 people exercise this right , which is 7 % of those liable
Around 80 % do their military service and a little over 10 % are excus@@ ed
There is also concern regarding the fact that there is a total of 20 people in prison who refuse and are unwilling to fulfil their civic duties in any way
I think that in the future it will be the task of the Finnish Parliament to get the balance right
The fact that the vast majority of young men in Finland do military service is not because there are no alternatives to it
In Finland we still remember all too well how important a cons@@ crip@@ ted army is for the country 's independence
During the Second World War , apart from London and Moscow , Helsinki was the only capital city of a country at war that was not occupied
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , in making out that it is a champion of human rights , the European Union tail@@ ors them to its needs
At the same time , it systematically encourages existing democratic rights to be undermined or abolished , using terrorism and illegal immigration as its pretext
The European Union 's version of human rights is set out in the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights which the Communist Party of Greece has denounced as inadequate and misleading
Hence my disappointment with the report that has been presen@@ ted; with its lack of balance and rig@@ or
Madam President , I personally am very happy that Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel 's report sums up the human rights situation in the European Union and even within the Member States
How can we have credibility and impose these rights in our relations with these countries , if we ourselves do not respect them ?
Some Members here will be horrified at the thought of naming certain countries in this report
As democrats , we are representatives of our citizen@@ s; we are not protectors of the policies of our national governments
Def@@ ending human rights is a duty and a right which must not be hampered by the principle of non-@@ interference in the internal affairs of the Member States
The purpose of this report is therefore to assess the situation
Mr President , in common with the EU Member States , the European Parliament has a responsibility to defend human rights and fundamental freedoms and rights
This weakens the basis of democracy
If all rights are equally important , no right is in the end especially important
An annual report by the European Parliament is of doubtful value if it is a spectrum of subjective views
Political wish lists easily result in new topics being lighted upon instead of there being a focus upon the really fundamental rights
These rights should be more to the point than many of those included in the report
It has become apparent that existing Member States too need to be reminded of them
The EU should impose sanctions on Member States that fail to uphold democratic elections and in which there is proven electoral fraud
The Convention should reflect upon these issues
There are , however , positive new things in the report worth mentioning
Data protection and transparency are included
Rights to these must be developed in the Treaty
Data protection and the right of access to documents are included in the Charter of Fundamental Rights
The time is now ripe for citizens ' right to information under Article 255 of the Treaty to be made more specific
In conclusion , the European Parliament has an important role to play in issues relating to human rights and fundamental freedoms and rights
The issue clearly needs to be explored further
Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel has made this clear
That is good , but there should preferably be a more concentrated approach next time , with the issue explored more deeply rather than just broadened out
We must clearly develop our methods for the future
Mr President , I want to begin by thanking my colleague , Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel for the sterling work she has done on this report
There is no doubt that we in the EU are well off when it comes to respect for freedoms and rights
It is an important issue that affects what is most basic to a properly functioning EU - mutual trust between the Member States
Rights are infringed , and there are failures to respect fundamental freedoms and rights , and it is not just ' everywhere else ' that these things happen
I want to make it clear that the Swedish Government had been responding to the criticism for a long time and had instituted an inquiry that was completed last year
The perspectives from which the inquiry was conducted clearly included that of citizens ' rights
Another very important issue is that of the rights of European citizens in legal processes such as arrests
There are Member States in which people are held without trial for long peri@@ od@@ s; we must debate this issue
Our young people travel throughout Europe
No one on EU territory should need to feel anxious that their personal freedom may be infringed because of inefficiency at police stations and in prisons
We must therefore emphasise very clearly that all European citizens are guaranteed certain rights in legal processes in all the EU countries
I look forward to the Commission 's continued work on this issue and to its proposals
Trafficking in human beings , particularly women and children , is a fact in this EU of ours
The EU is in many cases the final destination for people who , in desperation and confusion , are taken away from their home countries
It is a modern slave trade , and we must ask ourselves how that trend can be stopped
I am concerned about the fact that many EU countries accept various forms of prostitution
It turns the EU into a favourable market for traffickers in human beings throughout the world
There is an unambiguous link between human trafficking and prostitution
They are two sides of the same coin
I should have liked to have seen the report be clearer on this point
We must make great demands of ourselves in the EU , now that we are making demands of the candidate countries
There are many very good points in Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel 's report and a huge amount of hard work has gone into its preparation
Inevitably , it makes many of us feel uncomfortable when we find our own countries being referred to as not having ratified many of the human rights conventions
Of course , it has not been used for a great many years and was maintained on our statute books only for the killing of policemen
But I would particularly like to welcome her section on the rights of children
I have been a Member of this Parliament probably longer than most people here at the moment
However , the UN optional protocol on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography is also referred to
We did not consider any of these issues when we started discussing human rights and holding the annual discussion on human rights
For example , the issue of the exploitation of children on the Internet was not even a tw@@ in@@ kle in the Commission 's eye until relatively recently
It was not an area about which we actually had a great deal of knowledge or information
The section recognising these as important rights for children that have to be protected is to be warmly welcomed
I would like to thank Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel for making this such an important part of the report
Mr President , Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel 's report contains a couple of interesting points
I endorse what Mrs Banotti has just said about children 's rights
Exam@@ ining this in detail in a parliamentary report is an excellent idea
It would be excellent if Parliament had a role to play in this
Her suggestion that the European Social Charter be compared with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is also a very good one
I think that the Charter of Human Rights should be given priority , but it is a good idea to measure everything we do against both of these char@@ ters
That must be an absolutely basic requirement
The European Parliament would then win the confidence of the Council , for example , with a view to communitisation
The Council , the people , the Member States and the parliaments of the Member States must know that we are using our powers in the proper manner
There is , after all , no real consistency in the application of the Charter of Human Rights
You could much rather regard Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel 's ideology and views as a guide for assessing Member States
A country can easily be respectable even if it is criticised by Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel
That really is too ridiculous for words
Nevertheless , you also cannot say - to give you yet another example of slop@@ pin@@ ess - that unmarried couples should have the same rights as married couples
That is idio@@ tic@@ ; it will not make you popular with unmarried couples
The fact is they do not want all these rights
I am very much in favour of promoting gay rights , but not by saying that you will also get the rights you do not want
The report is thus riddled with all sorts of examples that are also impossible from a legal point of view
Mr President , the major split in the vote on this report in the relevant committee must mean that Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel has not sought a unifying solution
Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel , does , for example , the fact that polygam@@ y is not accepted in the European Union mean that Muslims resident in Europe are discriminated against ?
Is this a crime against human rights ?
The question no doubt needs to be answered when so many new subjects have been added to the topic of human rights
There is therefore a need to ' import ' women into a country in which prostitution is , strangely enough , considered to be a lawful and approved activity
There are instances in which so-called assisted euthanasia is abused
Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel has been very selective
We Christian Democrats will of course vote against this report , because Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel has failed in an important task of the European Parliament
The first concerns the ban on women pilgrims entering Moun@@ t Ath@@ os in Greece
This ban has been in place for 1@@ 200 years and is enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union and the Greek constitution
It cannot therefore be changed , nor should it , because to do so would be to accept that the home is not inviolable
It is a pity that we always go too far and end up ridic@@ uling fundamental rights
In fact , the Portuguese Pen@@ al Code makes no distinction in the field of sexual orientation with regard to the age of consent
This will clearly always be the case until we have a legally applicable Charter of Fundamental Righ@@ ts; only then will things be done differently
No amount of political flexibility , no interpretative criteria will enable us to un@@ cover breaches of rights where these are not considered to be breaches under the law
Nor , on the other hand , can we allow any breach of rights to be justified by political criteria
This point says ' recommends that the Member States should introduce a sunset provision in their specific anti-terrorism legislation '
I have checked the text by Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel and , indeed , ' specific ' should be replaced by ' exceptional '
Specific legislation can be common legislation which under no circumstances must be subject to sunset clauses or anything similar
It should not say ' specific ' but ' exceptional '
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
They are also the starting point for defence against such men@@ aces as organised crime , terrorism , smugglers , and illegal immigration
I welcome the initiatives taken by the Laeken European Council in December 2001 , when it mandated the Commission and the Council to take appropriate steps to deal with this
I certainly welcome the Commission proposal , congratulate the Commissioner on the excellence of his preparatory work , and welcome the Council 's plan of action
On these things there is broad agreement
I can also tell you - and I am glad to be able to do so - that these proposals met with broad consensus in the committee
I want , therefore , to express my gratitude for the close cooperation , which has seen all parties united in a concern for security
What , then , are the crucial points in my report , on which there is such agreement ?
The first is that we need to analyse and redefine the tasks involved and establish a common set of legal regulations
The Common Man@@ ual on border control should be revised to include the common standards and to take account of best practice
Le@@ ading on from that , the second priority is joint training and re-training
We must at long last give tangible effect to Article 7 of the Convention applying the Schengen Agreement
We are already engaged in drawing up a common core curriculum for border guards
The third priority is that the equipment used should be inter@@ change@@ able
In this area , there is a lack of compatibility within the Member States , and practical cross-border cooperation is made utterly impossible by the completely incompatible technical standards involved
If we go over to using shared satellite or ra@@ d@@ ar systems or start cooperating across borders , then compatible equipment becomes an absolute necessity
Fourthly , we should carry out an ongoing risk analysis
There is no doubt that this could achieve certain synergies
Parliament will give its full support to the endeavours of the Commission and the Council if they go down this road
We might also say that the two documents , the Commission proposal and the Council action plan , contain a great deal of common ground
We have the Schengen acquis , that , as Mr Pirker quite rightly underlined , is implemented very differently in the various States
Secondly , however , by also establishing a code of good practice for establishing common standards
The second objective is the training of border guards
This project is being led by Austria and by Sweden
The third objective is to use modern information technologies to improve the control of our external borders
We will similarly be presenting the first proposals on the control of the European Union 's external sea borders
The fourth objective is to define a common risk analysis model for controlling our external borders
As a result of the functioning of this new body at European level it has been possible to develop , as early as in 2002 , two practical operations
These two operations were , in 2002 , funded by the ARGO Programme and new actions for operational cooperation have already been presented for 2003
Finally , the Seville European Council supported the principle of sharing responsibilities for controlling the external borders
This is a sharing of responsibilities in financial terms , in terms of sharing equipment and also with a view to creating , eventually , a common border guard force
The Commission presented an initial evaluation of the financial situation
The Commission therefore requested further clarification and intends , during the Greek Presidency , to propose criteria for sharing financial responsibility for controlling the external border of the European Union
Mr President , I would also like to congratulate Mr Coelho
Free movement within the Union is one of the most cherished achievements for this House and for many citizens in the European Union
The rules which regulate the free movement of persons within the Union are Community rules
Many of the measures it has been necessary to establish in order to guarantee it are scattered around our legislation
To guarantee this free movement requires a high degree of trust and cooperation between the Member States , particularly in the management of external borders
We believe that the European Commission has raised the need to deal with this issue correctly and in a timely manner
Firstly , because the enlargement of the European Union obliges us to do so
Thirdly , because it presents today , with the legal framework we have - and perhaps also the financial framework - the possibility of making progress on this objective
Therefore , and despite our extremist tendencies , the Socialist Group will vote in favour of the Pirker report
I hope that the enthusiasm and broad support of this House are contagious and that the Council will go beyond its political declarations and actively and enthusiastically support this proposal
As the Commission itself says , the topic in this case is integrated management of the Member States ' external borders
Even if the motion for a resolution in this report is adopted , moreover , it will , of course , in itself have no direct legal effects
Rather , the motion and the Commission 's communication will acquire significance in the light of a series of other decisions concerning the development of police cooperation
In this context , the proposal signifies a development that , in my view , is a threat to democratic control and the rule of law
This is a policy that would considerably weaken the national authorities in favour of the EU authorities
The unmis@@ take@@ able ambition is to develop a supranational border police force in the longer term , one of several steps on the road towards an actual federal police force
This expansion of the police service is , at one and the same time , about un@@ thinking EU integration and the securing of Fortress Europe
The content of the motion is no less alarming
What does the Commission have to say about democratic and judicial control ?
What we have is a non-binding and ill thought-out policy to the effect that control must be ensured
What does the report have to say ?
Hitherto impro@@ m@@ p@@ t@@ u experiments with mixed pat@@ ro@@ ls have yielded excellent results
The section which addresses the issue of combating illegal immigration is extremely innovative
This involves a difficult , daily undertaking , particularly on the part of border States such as Spain , Portugal , Italy and Greece
I disagree , to an extent , with Mr Krarup , in that this is an issue that no one country can address on its own
It is vital that there are common policies , agreements and understandings between the 15 Member States
Having said that , we recognise the different situations in each Member State
Mrs Terrón i Cusí spoke earlier about the situation on the southern border of Spain
My own country , the United Kingdom , consists of one large island plus the north of Ireland
Greece , for example , has some 400 islands , and Luxembourg is land-@@ locked
We all have very different situations and , in their own ways , these are very difficult to monitor and manage
But we do not manage very well with 15 countries at the moment
We must make certain that we respect the rights of the individual
I agree with Mr Krarup on that
Effectively , this means border management , hand-in-hand with common policies on asylum and immigration
It means being prepared to constantly update and upgrade , and it means border management which takes account of citizens ' rights of movement
If we put those together we will address the issues for the years ahead in an enlarged European Union
The Commission has now changed its mind and presented a sensible proposal for a common framework for control of our external borders
It is to be regretted that Commissioner Verheugen has wasted a lot of valuable time by talking rubbish
Poland 's border with its non-EU neighbours is over 1 200 kilometres long and runs across fields for the whole of its length
This is where European solidarity is needed , as the defence of the external borders by a number of Member States is to the ultimate benefit of all Member States
Denmark , Sweden , Belgium , and the Netherlands reap the benefits of a high level of external border control
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I feel myself honoured to be allowed to say the last word here today
I have high hopes of them
Over and over again , they ask why we need the police so much
I become really fed up with it all and find myself thinking that the responsibility must be shouldered by us all together
It is for that reason that I hope we can all reach our objective together
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11
( The sitting was closed at 9 p
The strange thing about the S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel report is that it contains a detailed account of the reasons why the Resolution that it is proposing should be rejected
In general , I wish my report to be a progressive one
Ladies and gentlemen , this is the second stage of a prolonged process
The four proposals we are going to debate today fall within the framework of this process
The rapporteur is Mr Jarzembowski , who has done a wonderful job
Ladies and gentlemen , the White Paper on European transport policy provides an alarming description of the development of rail freight transport
Over this period , the quality of services provided to clients has not improved and in certain Member States it has worsened
This is therefore an extremely pressing issue
I do not believe we can wait until 2008 to open up international goods transport to competition throughout the European network
We must also deal with domestic transport
Ladies and gentlemen , the second proposed directive relates , of course , to rail safety
I believe that the issue of safety in transport is something which occupies and pre@@ occupies all of us , especially at the moment
I would also like to thank Mr Sterckx for his work
The creation of an internal market in rail services would not be possible without the establishment of common safety rules
We now come to the third proposed directive
If we establish the network , if we guarantee a common level of safety , with clearly defined responsibilities , it is also necessary to establish an interoperable system
Hence the amendment of Directives 96/@@ 4@@ 8/@@ EC and 2001/@@ 1@@ 6/@@ EC on interoperability , whose rapporteur is Mrs Ainardi
It is also a question of sending a very clear message about the need to standardise equipment , with a view to reducing costs
We cannot just remove administrative borders , but we must also remove technological borders in order to create this European rail network
I will finally comment on the fourth proposal , to create a European Railways Agency , on which Mr Savary has done some very considerable work
This Agency will provide technical support for decision making , without autonomous competences , and will provide the Commission with opinions and recommendations
The texts in question will be adopted by the Commission in accordance with a comitology procedure , as is currently the case in relation to interoperability
Let us finally opt for a modern railway , worthy of the twenty-first century , which is able to compete effectively with other modes of transport
This is an absolutely crucial point , because this is the only internal market that is actually still lacking in the transport sector
That is why , Commissioner , our four reports express our full agreement , in principle , with the Commission 's basic ideas
However , being a self-assured Parliament and co-legislator , we have also tabled some substantial amendments to the four Commission proposals
I hope that the Commissioner will support all of them
Why have we tabled amendments ?
By tabling these amendments we are seeking to hasten the revitalisation of the rail sector in the European Union
To achieve this objective of putting a larger proportion of the overall volume of traffic back onto the railways , we need to create appropriate framework conditions
These must be such that the rail networks really are opened up throughout the Union to existing and new railway undertakings , that is that network access is liberalised
And we need a high level of safety
Instead we need common , high European standards of safety for the benefit of passengers and railway staff
Finally , we need a European railway agency to energetically push forward all of these measures and monitor them
We have made progress on interoperability , but too slowly
Ladies and gentlemen , if we wait that long there will not be any railways left in Europe that are operated on a commercial basis
But we want to create the framework conditions to ensure that trains can compete with HGVs
I should like to make four brief comments on my report
The first , Commissioner , is one on which I think we now agree
We are against this and think that we need this special rail network on 15 March of this year so as to gain experience of cross-border freight transport
I hope that the Commission agrees
We want everyone to know that on 1 January 2006 they can be prepared for the networks actually to be opened up to freight services
I therefore hope that you will also agree to the independent rights that we want to grant them
My final point , Commissioner , relates to something that you did not address just now , but I should in any case like to make this request
You said that the Commission did not want to table proposals to open up the networks to passenger services as well until 2003
We therefore also want the rail market in passenger services to be opened up
Commissioner , it is precisely if we want to ensure that airspace is used sensibly that we need to attract more passengers onto the railways
That is why we will be fully supporting this report
It is , however , clear that in a European market such as this , where more players are entering the arena , there must be proper safety arrangements
The safety situation is satisfactory at the moment
Rail is a safe means of transport , it must remain at least as good and we must try to improve safety levels wherever possible
The directive we are now producing is an initial step towards European safety policy
At the moment there are still too many different rules and regulations which make this railway market in Europe too complex in many cases
We must therefore develop a standard procedure for the different Member States in this directive
The railway companies are naturally responsible for what they do , and as a Parliament we are adding the infrastructure managers to this
Every Member State should therefore have a safety body which operates independently and openly and is transparent
Everyone must know how things stand
Secondly , we must have a common approach to safety , a common safety goal
We will have to be as strict as possible in this regard , and the Commission must have the last word
We do not necessarily have to achieve this tomorrow , but we must at least be able to say what we are aiming for
All players must have a management system , and there must be common safety certificates for staff , for rolling stock and also for the infrastructure manager
As far as staff are concerned , I think that a European driving licence for train drivers is important
Communication is also import@@ ant@@ ; that is something I have added to my report
If you cross language boundaries you must also make sure that you solve language problems
The agency must have its say about how this is to be done
It is an important point , however
Thirdly , we must develop a common method of investigating accidents , investigating incidents , an independent investigative body and criteria that must be respected in these investigations
So you must not simply dismiss the knowledge that the old monopolies have at their dispos@@ al; you must use it to create a workable system
I am convinced that where we are now is an initial phase , that this is an initial step
We will have to discuss safety a few times more and amend and adapt directives over the next 10 , 15 and 20 years
I also think that we have achieved a good balance when it comes to the involvement of the staff concerned
It is important for the people who work on the railways to be involved in the things that concern them
Safety is also the work of man , and the people who are responsible for this work must be involved in the decision making
I think that this is in fact clearly stated in the directive
Mr Jarzembowski 's report is also a significant step forward
What we need are open , dynamic , commerci@@ ally-@@ oriented railway companies that think European , not just nationally or locally
The culture of the national monopoly is still very much in evidence and too often prevents Europe 's railways from operating efficiently
As Mr Jarzembowski and the Commissioner have also said , we need a dynamic rail industry
When you see how the transport economy has developed , you cannot do without railway companies
Rail is a sustainable means of transport and we must look after it
With our reports and your proposals , Commissioner , I think that we are taking a significant step forward , for we need to progress towards a European transport market
This is crucial to the future of European railways in the twenty-first century
Rail is a more sustainable means of transport , entailing fewer external costs than road transport
It is also more environmentally friendly and safer
Despite all this , rail freight has declined over the last twenty years
It is my view that there are three main reasons for this decline
Firstly , we have industrial strategies favouring road transport and ' ju@@ st-@@ in-@@ time ' management , resulting in a greater number of journeys and greater dis@@ persal and fragmentation
Furthermore , there is distortion of competition between road and rail transport
The level of social regulation relating to road transport is notably low when compared to that for rail
Lastly , I share the view that the development of different networks according to national specifications has limited trade and has lead to inadequate cooperation and incompatible standards
My report on the high-speed network and the conventional network respectively , therefore seeks to make standards more compatible by bringing the two existing directives into line with each other
The report also includes a series of proposals to speed up harmonisation and to extend its scope
I would like to point out that my report is closely linked to the report on establishing a European Railway Agency
Consequently , a number of decisions on points concerning the Agency are included in my report as they stand in order to ensure that the package is coherent
While preparing my report , I met with operators , experts , the Commission , trade unions and public authorities on many occasions
As a result of the meetings , I identified a number of issues to which I would like to draw your attention
Firstly , in order to achieve interoperability , I think it is absolutely essential to take full account of the skills and know-how of the professionals working within the sector
The European Union must ensure the involvement of the sector if it is to harmonise the rail system
For example , during one of the meetings I had with railway staff , they proposed a recording device
I took this on board , as I believed it to be relevant
The introduction of a recording device now has universal support and is included in my report
Secondly , further to all these meetings , it has become clear to me that harmonisation and safety rules are inextricably linked
Harmonisation in this area cannot be carried out at a minimum level
Safety standards vary across the European Union
Low@@ ering safety standards to facilitate access to infrastructure would be counter-productive and even dangerous
Reducing safety would not be in the interests of harmonisation
One question remains unresolved , namely funding
En@@ orm@@ ous investment is needed to achieve this new stage of development
No specific budgetary provision is envisaged , though this is certainly called for
I am delighted that agreement has been reached on Article 29 of the Sterckx report , which promotes social dialogue
I also consider the agreement reached on the Savary report to be very important
This concerns the participation of staff representatives in drawing up technical specifications on interoperability which are of direct concern to them
I would also like to propose an amendment on the financial questions
Whilst I am aware that not everyone will share my point of view , I hope you will all understand the importance of the issue
The package as a whole is extremely important , given what is at stake
We bear an enormous responsibility for the future , as we are planning the European rail system for the twenty-first century
I would in addition like to express my opinion on the package as a whole
The Jarzembowski report proposes the complete liberalisation of rail freight services by 2003 , and of national passenger services by 2008
I must say that I am concerned about the proposals aimed at speeding up liberalisation , following up those proposed by the Commission
The transposition of the first package is only just taking place in Member States , and an assessment of the consequences has therefore yet to be undertaken
I agree that we need to revitalise the rail system
It is my view that the harmonisation of standards is a very relevant issue , as is the need for an Agency and strict safety rules
The Sterckx report on safety is also very important since , like the Commission , it is concerned in particular about the harmonisation of safety standards
The harmonisation of safety standards should , however , take account of the real situation of the sector , especially as regards implementation time
It would be useless , or even detrimental , to attempt to apply European standards too quickly
In conclusion , I would like to reiterate my conviction that both the long-term development and the revitalisation of the sector are at stake
The players in this sector count , be they operators or railway staff
Their skills and knowledge are valuable
The European Union can and must show that it intends to involve them in the development of the rail system
I would like to express my appreciation first to the four rapporteurs for their excellent work , and to all the political groups
I think that we have all put a lot into this second package because we feel that we need to develop the European rail network
Europe needs a railway network because it will have to deal with serious environmental problems in the years to come
The public will not forgive us for not developing alternatives to road transport
Furthermore , European Union involvement in railways represents an opportunity for the sector , not a constraint or a threat
What is clear is that the rail systems inherited from the old nation states are today no longer able to meet current demands
I therefore believe that we need to commit ourselves firmly to developing the European rail system
At present there are three solutions or approaches to this problem
The first way involves national tensions or , in other words , undeclared protectionism
It also entails corpor@@ a@@ tism and national vo@@ te-@@ winning measures
I think that this approach , evident in France and Germany , is not the way forward
We should not fear opening up within the European Union
Once again , this represents an opportunity for the rail sector as a whole
There is a second way of addressing the problem
I think that the incidents involving the Prestige and the Erika should give us cause for reflection
There is a price to be paid for transport
Transport policy cannot solely involve lowering prices through unbridled competition
We must not ignore recent maritime disasters
As a result of these terrible events we are today to set new standards and doubtless increase the cost of transporting dangerous goods by sea
I think that the third way of tackling the rail sector is that of opening it up in a controlled way
This involves maintaining the culture and expertise developed by the rail sector while ensuring that networks are opened up
In my opinion , this is the Swiss way
The first way , the French and German way , is too conservative
There are lessons to be learnt regarding the second British and Dutch way
The third , the Swiss way , opening up within a framework of functional integration , should be our enduring model
If we do not adopt this model , we are likely to be severely disappointed
In particular , it should have control of the implementation of rules and European harmonisation measures incumbent on all Member States
I believe that safety must be an absolute priority , because a safety culture is crucial for the railways
It is therefore essential that we adopt this approach
I would like to thank Commissioner de Palacio for the proposals that formed the basis of these very important reports
As regards the Sterckx report , a crucial document in my opinion , we must be fully aware that safety policy must not amount to a policy for dil@@ u@@ ting responsibilities
We must not draw up a policy that will entail the level@@ l@@ ing-down of safety standards
Rather , we must have a very demanding policy that maintains functional integrity
This means maintaining the functional integration of the railway while ensuring political and judicial independence
As regards the Ainardi report , I would simply hope that the amendments compatible with those relating to the Agency are adopted
Lastly , on my report relating to an Agency to harmonise rail safety , the competent committee has already voted on 48 amendments
I thought we could have left it there , but yet another amendment has just been tabled
We hoped this Agency would be an executive Agency of the Commission , steered by the Commission as far as possible
Thus we have an amendment stating that the Commission would preside over the Agency
This falls within the scope of the executive
One would therefore assume that the European Parliament would not be represented
I would like the number of Member States not to be increased but to remain at six
I would like them to adopt an executive post@@ ure , rather than what could be termed a parliamentary or legislative one
In addition , we hoped to make the Agency a common organisation for the whole of the European rail industry
We have therefore proposed including representatives from the entire rail sector on the administrative board
Clearly , this will allow progress to be made on many issues
Lastly , we hope there will be consultative committees , inquiry bodies and safety authorities
I have to say that personally I would be very worried if Amendment No 49 were carried , as this would destroy the entire proposal
I will finish on that note
I had intended to comment on the Jarzembowski report but I have run out of time and will do so in private
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for a long time transport policy was a poor relation in European policy
In plain language , for a long time nothing happened at all
It required a judgment by default from the European Court of Justice for things slowly to start in@@ ching forward , step by step
Much ought to have been done here in the last few years and it still has not been done , including establishing genuine coordination between the Member States
Mr Jarzembowski has already pointed out that the rail sector is the only one in which the internal market is not a reality
where rail is concerned we have probably not even started to make it a reality
That is why the necessary balance between the individual modes of transport is still lacking
This has also been mentioned once already today
The results are as bad as you would expect , particularly between road and rail where the gulf is tending to widen in the absence of sensible joint solutions
All of our other neighbouring countries have continued to let road strengthen its lead over rail
Now what is at issue specifically in the Ainardi report , for which I was also responsible as shadow rapporteur ?
Interoperability should and must be made a reality across the entire network
We cannot concentrate , as we did originally , on individual parts of the network - high-speed lines and so forth - and treat them separately
What is important here are reasonable costs and a high degree of safety
Both aspects have been addressed often enough here today
Where safety is concerned , I would specifically point out that we have now tabled a proposal to extend the black box system to the railways
Mr President , firstly I would like to thank all the rapporteurs for their work in this very important area
This is a difficult and complex subject not made any easier by the position that the whole railway industry finds itself in
If you look at rail freight in Europe , for example , the drop in traffic is quite alarming
If nothing is done , then within the next 15 years rail freight will not exist
There has to be change in how railways work , both in the passenger and freight sectors
The industry itself has to recognise that its service levels have been unacceptable and Member States must also recognise that investment levels have been in decline for many years
It is the inability of a train to cross borders without changing locom@@ o@@ tives , changing drivers or even changing bo@@ ge@@ ys that is the problem for our railways
A 4@@ 0-@@ tonne heavy goods lorry is fully interoperable
A freight train is not
That is the difficulty that faces the industry
It is not an easy problem to overcome
I , on behalf of my group , have followed the report by Mr Sterckx with regard to safety more closely than the others
It is our belief that in any work in the area of safety those who work in the sector must be involved
In this regard a difference exists between us and the PPE-DE Group
Our main goals are to ensure higher levels of safety whilst fully integrating our European rail system
D@@ il@@ ution of safety standards is not an option
That is why , as a group , we have submitted a number of amendments to Mr Sterckx 's report
All of us here are supporters of railways
Indeed some of us are somewhat fanatical and are often called an@@ or@@ aks by our colleagues
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , on behalf of my group I should firstly like to thank all the rapporteurs involved in the railway package
They have done some excellent work
Development of the railways , however , was far too late in getting started
The competitiveness of the railways has seriously decreased
There has been a shift to transportation along congested roads as well as by air , because the railways have not been able to improve their services quickly enough
At the same time congestion can be relieved and short flights replaced by railway transport services , which will result in a better balance between transport operators
As shadow rapporteur , I have followed Mr Savary 's drafting of the report closely
Mr Savary has also done good work
A properly established Railway Agency would boost development of the railways and monitor and promote innovation and good practice
We have tabled an amendment on this for which we hope there is support
These days , people and goods are travelling ever longer distances
Much too much of this travelling is taking place on the motorway or by air
This can be achieved quickly by improving cooperation between national railway companies or by merging large-scale and cross-border activities into one single European operation
Liberalisation means that we will only be able to travel where entrepreneurs can expect to make a profit
This compul@@ sion to liberalise will make it more difficult to guarantee continuity and safety
Despite the European unity that has been achieved , there is currently less cross-border rail traffic in many places than there was in the time before the EU was created
In the Netherlands , which wanted to take the lead , liberalisation has resulted in a significant reduction in the quality of train services
Part of the package of four reports that have just been presented will have a detrimental effect on the railway company 's duty of service
If we do not accept that part , the future will look a great deal better
Mr President , I would first like to thank all fellow MEPs and rapporteurs
The aim of all reforms must be to create a sustainable transport policy in Europe
Liberalisation can sometimes be a means to achieving this , but never an end in itself
The extremely poor situation in respect of maritime transport must indeed be a warning to us
Fre@@ ight traffic in Europe has become a problem due to the enormous increase in the number of lorries on our roads
Indeed , we do not view liberalisation as an end in itself , and we are therefore not in favour of liberalising passenger transport
Passen@@ ger transport by rail is a public service and must remain so
Transport must also remain affordable for everyone , so it should not only be the profitable lines that are allowed to be le@@ ased or sold
The negative consequences of liberalisation are already being felt by travellers
International lines outside of the high-speed network are being cut back
That there is a problem is , however , demonstrated by the poor rail connection between Brussels and Strasbourg I got a taste of yesterday
The European Commission has done too little research into the consequences of liberalisation for rail transport
We think that an assessment is urgently needed before we go any further down the road towards liberalisation
With this in mind , we have therefore submitted an amendment to Mr Jarzembowski 's report
The three other reports closely reflect the problems and issues of the sector
Then coming up with practical ways of cooperating effectively in the Ainardi report
Finally , a Railways Agency to support the entire harmonisation process and to get it on track in the Savary report
The Sterckx , Savary and Ainardi reports place the emphasis on cooperation and consultation between different companies
These companies could naturally have done this themselves , but they seem to only spring into action when competition is imminent
Europe should naturally have organised this internal rail market much earlier
This Railways Agency should have been in place thirteen years ago
The free movement of goods was not organised in a sustainable way in the twentieth century
The twenty-first century must bring the changes we so urgently need
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are indeed some excellent sections in the reports on the development of rail transport we have before us
In particular , Mr Jarzembowski is right to be concerned about the decline of rail transport compared to road and air transport
As regards freight , the Commission has noted that the market share of rail freight transport in Europe has declined from 21 % in 1970 to 8 % in 1998
During this time , however , the volume of goods requiring transportation has increased considerably and people are travelling ever more frequently
These developments have had disastrous consequences
This increase in the flow of goods and people has disastrous repercussions for three spheres
There are consequences for the environment as road and air transport cause more pollution than railways
There are consequences in terms of increased traffic as the road network and air corridors are saturated
The higher road death toll is not down to the French being more reckless behind the wheel than their European neighbours , as the French Government maintains
The explanation lies in the fact that the major tr@@ unk routes used by lorries in France linking Mediterranean countries with Northern and Eastern Europe have now reached full capacity
These lorries sometimes ho@@ g the carri@@ ag@@ e@@ way for several kilometres and cause many accidents and traffic@@ -@@ jams
I do not think , however , that the proposals presented in the reports of our fellow Members , which the Commission supports , address the situation appropriately
In my opinion , France has no need of a European Railway Agency or more European regulation in order to free up its roads
It needs a government that will assume its responsibilities and tackle the causes of the problem
We should ask ourselves why the French Government has failed to follow the example of the Swiss Government on this matter
The government should build a pi@@ gg@@ yback rail network and oblige all lorries travelling through France to use it
One reason is that the SNCF is in the grip of the trade unions and is consequently becoming worse and worse at fulfilling its role as a public service
A third is that the car is one of the few remaining freedoms in an increasingly regulated society
Our leaders are out of touch with reality
They have official cars and dream of recre@@ ating life under Mao
Many Mao@@ ists have in fact been rein@@ car@@ n@@ ated as environment@@ alists
We must revitalise and liberalise the entire sector if we really want rail traffic to take over part of the constantly growing demand for transport
The sector has suffered years of neglect in the hands of the various governments who controlled the railways - not the big international companies , Mr Meijer
Furthermore , the sector was and still is a bas@@ tion of national interests whose main aim is to promote its own interests and not to become involved in cross-border interests
Furthermore , the rail freight sector only discovered the concept of profit about a year ago
The only thing that was important was volume
Now billions will have to be invested throughout Europe in order to get the infrastructure and rolling stock up to standard
Interoperability and the harmonisation of safety regulations have often been an uphill battle up until now
Every railway company is sticking to its own practices and systems
It will therefore be important for the Railways Agency to set a good example , play a pioneering role and at the same time act in a supervisory capacity
The Railways Agency 's expertise and clear responsibilities are therefore very important
If we are to avoid rever@@ ting to traditional national differences , these experts from the industry must therefore not express the viewpoint of their previous employers
It is therefore essential for the Agency to be able to operate completely independently and transparently
The new predomin@@ ance of historically big companies will result in few newcomers having access to the Agency
The Railways Agency must also have enough powers to be able to execute its tasks properly
In general , harmonisation of the safety regulations in Europe is very important for an efficient railway sector
Bureauc@@ ratic obstacles must be eliminated as far as possible
On this point I am still of the opinion that it is not desirable to permit worker involvement in purely technical matters
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to congratulate the rapporteurs , who have done a magnificent job
This package , building on earlier decisions , will actually take us an important step closer to establishing a European railway
The restrictions imposed by the nation-states , and the fears that they still have , will - I hope - soon be consigned to the past
I dealt personally with Mr Jarzembowski 's and Mrs Ainardi 's reports
Obviously for us Social Democrats - let me be quite open about it - this is a tricky business
Secondly , there are unfortunately a number of countries that are still very restrictive where market opening is concerned
I therefore assume that a more constructive and reasonable compromise proposal will emerge from the conciliation procedure
Thirdly , it is my view that we need to put pressure on the national railway undertakings , be they public or private
A certain amount of pressure to liberalise and move towards market opening is therefore certainly very important for the national railway companies
Turning now to Mrs Ainardi 's report , this is also a very good piece of work
I believe that it is particularly important for the workers to be included in the process of reforming the railways
I would also like to mention that the committee of which I am chairman has worked well on this matter , as always
It is quite clear , however , that the committee is concerned by certain delays in the Council and has made this clear in more or less formal terms
the use of the railways is continuing to decline , despite all the good intentions expressed
When I consider specific cases which are particularly important to me such as the trans-@@ Alpine routes , I find this totally unacceptable
I regret to say that there is no genuine European rail network
We are building it with these directives
I am not very impressed by this second rail package given that I strongly support the public services
I voted against the first rail package also
Its effects have yet to make themselves felt in practice
Nevertheless , we have already been presented with a second package , which is just as bad as the last previous one
The aim of the Jarzembowski report is to speed up the development of competition
It attempts to apply road transport standards to rail transport with disastrous consequences
It is actually stated clearly that opening up the rail freight transport market will lead to increased competition which is likely to entail job losses
In short , this report means more liberalisation for fewer jobs
As for the report on safety , its main aim is liber@@ alis@@ ation; safety is just an excuse
It is evident that the justification sections often use the safety argument to protect the internal market and exclude new players
The market and safety issues are however clearly incompatible
We would do well to remember the long list of environmental and human disasters that ensued from the complete liberalisation of the maritime transport sector
Sadly , we have already seen many examples of this , from the collapse of Sabena and that of Air Li@@ b , to the state of the railways in Britain
I remain a strong advocate for the provision of a high-quality European public service
I am for cooperation between different rail networks
I fully support the process of harmonising working conditions , safety standards , salaries and social rights
I believe that the people and those employed in the public services should be in control
In short , I am opposed to this second rail package
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first of all like to thank the rapporteurs
the railway industry drinking in the last chance s@@ alo@@ on and ceasing to exist after a certain time
Mr Jarzembowski was also talking about a balanced relationship
We also think that it is absolutely necessary to revitalise the railways , for environmental and other reasons
Interoperability must be changed , safety must be improved , we must set up a Railways Agency , and so on
Let us go back briefly to the core of the matter , however
We actually disagree strongly with regard to the package that Mr Jarzembowski is talking about
We have already had some experience with liberalisation in Europe - in the UK and in the Netherlands as well
I would like to talk about the Dutch example briefly
Mr Z@@ al@@ m , the Liberal front run@@ ner in the elections and a former Dutch minister , is now saying that it was a mistake to split up N@@ S and Pro@@ Rail
In other words , Railway Directive 91/@@ 4@@ 40/@@ EC , the original separation of infrastructure and operation , is seen as being wrong
The Dutch Minister of Transport , Mr de Bo@@ er , also came to this conclusion recently and is asking for an inquiry for this very reason
In other words , we think that liberalisation is an excellent opportunity for goods transport
For this reason we are asking most emphatically for an evaluation proposal and we hope that you will support the amendment
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as a Liberal , I am very satisfied with the railways package and our four rapporteurs ' reports
Particularly with the fact that Mr Jarzembowski has included passenger transport in his report and has outlined a plan for it
I cannot emphasis often enough that liberalisation is somewhat different from independence or uncontrolled privatisation , as was tried in the UK
It is of vital importance - including for the sector itself - that we have more providers on the European railways
Only then can we achieve a healthy railway market through genuine competition
Why not let the N@@ S@@ -@@ car@@ go@@ /@@ D@@ B@@ -@@ cargo combination compete directly with SNCF
There is nothing wrong with that
It must all be safe , so we , the legislators , must assume our responsibility for this
Mrs Ainardi 's report is based on interoperability , acknowledging each other , the international recognition of regulations , the recognition of signals and the recognition of safety standards
That is also why it is so important to pay attention to this
That is why the European Railways Agency , proposed the Savary report , is so important
Fore@@ sight is the essence of government
I believe it would be better , as is the case with motorways , to only liberalise the operation of the railways , leaving the rail infrastructures under public ownership
I would ask the Commission to inform us regularly and periodically on all these issues
It is inherent in the very concept of the internal market that freight and passenger transport should have an appeal that gains them acceptance
I can only hope that we and the Commissioner can push this through together in the Council
I can only say that the Member States should have done it long ago , and now we are going to do it instead
Mr President , I shall take advantage of this second opportunity to address the House to comment in more detail on Mr Jarzembowski 's report
This document contains two ground@@ breaking proposals
The first involves the abolition of the Trans-European Rail Fre@@ ight Network and contempl@@ ates the complete liberalisation of international as well as national , regional and local freight networks by 2006
The second involves the opening up and liberalisation of the rail passenger network
As regards the first proposal , I share the view that we need to make a strong political gesture in support of railways
I have many more reservations however about international rail passenger services
Unlike freight , I do not consider the liberalisation of passenger services to be an absolute priority
I regularly take the train and have not encountered any particular difficulties at border crossings
I am nevertheless aware that there are significant commercial interests at stake in this sector
I do not support the view that we should restrict ourselves simply to creating a rail market
Rather , I think we should work towards a European transport policy , which is not quite the same thing
If we do , we will have parts of the market that duplicate each other within the same area , and rail will constitute a substitute for road transport
Other aspects of the transport strategy therefore need to be implemented
I think that the latter should be a priority if we want to ensure that the opening up of the rail market gives the rail sector an advantage over road
We must create an investment policy , not simply a rail market
Consequently , I personally hope that this debate sends a very strong message from the European Parliament to the Council
For many months trans-European rail network funding policy has been deadlocked in the Council
It has maintained a regressive approach to the matter and does not want to consider fiscal issues , fuel taxation or large European loans
Ladies and gentlemen , this is the message I would like to send from the European Parliament to the Council
Mr President , the process of opening up the European rail network to competition , as recommended by the Jarzembowski report , is a retrograde step
It represents a serious threat to the interests of both rail users and employees
Voting in favour of this report amounts to behaving like a vul@@ gar lobby@@ ist for those private interests who want to do away with the public service railways
Everyone knows that private companies are only interested in their profits and will therefore cut back on investment or staff
Everyone is aware that the privatisation of British Rail has led to a series of disasters
Rail transport should be an integrated European public service
We reject this report and all other proposals for privatisation
I believe that this was completely the wrong attitude
We want better environmental protection , more goods to be transferred from road to rail , a better modal balance and thus better protection for consumers
We escaped an environmental disaster by the skin of our teeth
We hope that these reports - and his in particular - will mean that we can take a substantial step in the right direction
We hope that we can continue further along this positive route
Mr President , we of course support all measures designed to enhance the role of rail transport and to change the present situation , which favours road transport
That is why we particularly support the reports by S@@ yl@@ viane Ainardi and G@@ illes Savary
Nevertheless , we will not achieve the interoperability needed by liberalising this sector
In cases where this has happened , private operators have not responded , particularly as regards the high levels of investment required
Nor has the Commission told us where it is going to find the finance needed to achieve this goal
Furthermore , we are against the total liberalisation of the freight and passenger transport sectors by 2008
We are responsible to Europe 's citizens
We must have the courage to fight for a public rail transport service which is of a high standard and safe , which will encourage people to use it
Furthermore , in some cases , they propose going further and more quickly in the reform of the rail sector
That is why the majority of the proposals are acceptable to the Commission , either in their current form or in principle
they provide it with detail , they improve it and they clarify some of the specific points
Firstly , ladies and gentlemen , I am surprised that some of you are still raising the debate on whether or not the railways should be liberalised
We are not talking about privatising the rail network
The Commission is not adopting any action of this type
Secondly , we argue that there should be competition between the various operators
The only alternative to this situation of competition is to create a single European operator , operating for the entire European rail network
Do the honourable Members really believe that this can be done ?
I frankly believe not; that is not the way forward
We are talking about introducing rationality into the rail sector and turning it into a rail sector which is European and appropriate for the twenty-first century
As Commissioner responsible for transport , I would like to thank the chairman and the entire committee once again for their understanding , support and cooperation in all our work
Mr President , I will refer briefly to the amendments tabled
In this regard , all these amendments are acceptable to the Commission
I would like to thank Mr Jarzembowski for his support for the proposals the Commission will shortly present
I believe that that is the important point
We do not therefore accept Amendment No 56
This is something that we must bear in mind if we really want to achieve the objective and ambitions of the Lisbon European Council
We accept the proposal of the or@@ ange box of recorders , which will be strengthened with the L@@ R@@ T@@ M@@ S
Here also we can accept the majority of the amendments , but not all of them , since some of them are not in line with the principles
I would like to thank Mr Savary for the improvements he contributes through his proposals
We support all these amendments , in particular Amendment No 14 , which we consider to be very positive
Other amendments are superfluous in view of provisions in force or proposals planned for 2003 and we cannot therefore accept them
The joint debate is closed
The vote will take place at noon
Nevertheless , we have failed to make significant progress on rail transport
Decisions have chiefly been made at intergovernmental level , with each country trying to defend its own interests , and this has undermined the creation of a European railway market
This situation is untenable , because we are reaching saturation point in road transport , which is imposing a very heavy burden on our economic and environmental systems
Political will and an appropriate level of funding are needed to tackle this problem
There are social consequences in relation to safety in the road transport sector , and I believe we must deal with them
This proposal repe@@ als and replaces the Regulation of 1985
Its aim is to simplify , clarify and update a piece of legislation which was approved 17 years ago
This modification favours effective application of the rules and in particular the introduction of digital spe@@ ed@@ ome@@ ters
One of the main factors which has inspired this revision has been the increase over the last 17 years in the number of services offered by private companies
Furthermore , an explicit provision is introduced so that all Member States adopt the seizure of vehicles as one of the penalties for failing to comply with the law
This committee will work in collaboration with the existing European-@@ level committee for dialogue with the sector
Both documents are - as Mrs de Palacio said - obviously closely related , by virtue of their content , to this report
I should like to thank Mr Andersson , who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs
We had a number of preliminary discussions together
I believe that it was this cooperation that made it possible for a number of important compromise amendments to be adopted in the committee
The regulation on the table has to take into account and inter@@ link three different aspects
Firstly , improved road safe@@ ty; secondly , social protection of workers , and thirdly , fair conditions of competition on the European Union 's roads
I would ask you not to comply with their wishes and instead to give the proposed draft the go-ahead
What then are the most important points on which a majority of the committee has so far been able to agree ?
One , the regulation applies to all drivers of vehicles carrying goods or passengers by road , regardless of whether they are employed or self-employed
Two , the regulation also applies to vehicles from third countries when they are in the territory of the European Union
Three , the Commission is instructed to table this regulation for negotiation with the contracting parties to the A@@ ET@@ R
Five , the concept of ' driving time ' has been defined by the committee so as to create greater legal certainty
Nine , the number of proposed checks on compliance with the regulation has been doubled
Ten , the transport undertakings are obliged to take the steps required to acquain@@ t themselves with the total time worked , even where drivers are employed by several employers
That is why several amendments have also been tabled in plenary and I would encourage you to support them
We are proposing a maximum weekly driving time of 45 hours , which is still considerably more than the number of hours worked in almost any other branch of employment
Secondly , I hope , like many of my fellow Members , that the number of exemptions in this regulation will be reduced still further
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to begin by thanking the rapporteur , Mr Markov , for his constructive cooperation in preparing the report
In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we have mainly confined ourselves to health and safety , but these issues belong together
Proper driver health and safety whereby , for example , drivers were thoroughly rested when they took the wheel , would promote road safety
Minimum rules throughout the internal market would also guarantee that there was no distortion of competition
It is rather odd that there should be proposals to reject this report
The big problem , and one of the reasons why change is required , is , in actual fact , the poor compliance with the existing regulation
I myself can see that there is poor compliance in my own country
We have therefore tabled Amendments Nos 105 and 10@@ 6
We have therefore tabled Amendment No 107
This amendment has unfortunately been wrongly translated in the Swedish version , which is why the English version applies
Amendment No 110 is about the need not to remun@@ erate drivers according to a pre-@@ arranged distance to be travelled
P@@ aying drivers on a piec@@ e@@ work basis is quite unjustifiable
In conclusion , Amendment No 113 is aimed at requiring the two sides of industry at European level to carry out regular evaluations of this new regulation
With 300 amendments the work was not easy
The main issue raised in this context was the necessity of a new regulation
In principle , however , the PPE-DE Group is in favour of amendment
This was a challenge for us
There was unanimity - and I should like to underline this here - on at least two points , the first being on checks
Less than 1 % , as is the case in certain countries , is not enough
The 2 % minimum that has been suggested here should certainly be respected
We know that for various reasons companies move their headquarters to third countries , not only for economic reasons , but for other reasons too
That is why it is important over time for us to create this European transport area
We wanted to build in flexibility
Exemp@@ tions have been discussed and obviously I do not want to mention all of them
The concept of safety should not mean that the regulation imposes restrictions on the people who are actually responsible for safety
One area where we are still undecided is cou@@ ri@@ er services
We have also introduced flexibility to the breaks
We did not just want week@@ ends of between 24 and 45 hours , but also 36 hours
We do not call into question the 12-@@ hour nigh@@ tly rest period either , with the related flexibility of nine plus three hours
This also applies to the daily rest periods and the short breaks
Safety was the other aspect that needed to be brought into the equation
Rest periods , daily rest periods and weekend rest periods are issues of safety and it is not unknown for over@@ tired drivers to be involved in accidents
Nevertheless , we should not exaggerate this either
Some statistics show the risk to be very high
Overall we work on the basis of realistic statistics showing that this is the case for around 15 % of serious road traffic accidents
This is not about sing@@ ling out the roads yet again for wholesale condemnation
The initiative being taken here by the Commission and Parliament will , I believe , improve safety
As far as infringements are concerned , as we see it taking vehicles out of service is the best approach
I am referring here to the discussions that we had earlier
This does not in any way mean that if we want to bring about a modal shift it can only be done by adopting legislation on road transport
Instead this must go hand in hand with clear initiatives in the other transport sectors
Mr President , in the German press pre@@ view there was a headline that is very apt for this dossier
fresh goods need fresh drivers
We recently experienced the Prestige disaster
We should not become accustomed to them , however , because there are - as the statistics show - two main causes of accidents on our roads
That is why it is absolutely crucial for us to include these express services , this spr@@ inter class , in this regulation
I think it is sensible , if at all possible , for drivers to spend their weekly rest periods at home , where they live , with their families
Obviously it is not sensible to spend a rest time in a travelling vehicle , and we have therefore stated this in the text
For me , in any case , this is also one of the most important points
The fact that this allows a period of 28 days to be monitored in a road@@ side check will make a huge contribution to improving safety on Europe 's roads
Mr President , Commissioner , I would first like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Markov , for drawing up this report
He has done a thorough job and , furthermore , listened to those of us who have a different opinion with regard to this issue
Road safety is an important matter
From the point of view of the transport sector it is also essential to improve the social status of drivers and the esteem they are held in
The Commission proposal , however , was badly drafted
In the committee debate we were able to improve the proposal , although , in the opinion of our group , the end result is still not acceptable
The proposal would increase inflexibility and lead to practices that would be difficult to monitor and which would cause the sector to incur additional costs
Furthermore , natural breaks at work cannot be taken advantage of
The new regulation will not improve road safety either
We have also put forward important proposals for improvements in case the rejection proposal is blocked
The basic idea behind them is that the provisions on rest periods in the current regulation are adequate provided that they are complied with and monitored effectively
More effective monitoring will lead to better results than if the provisions are merely made more stringent on paper
Mr President , Mr Markov has produced a sterling piece of work
His report examines rules that will simplify a very complicated area
D@@ ri@@ ving is one of the hardest and most pressurised jobs there is
The seat behind the wheel in buses and lorries is a back-@@ breaking place of work
The simple new rules proposed by Mr Markov would ease the burden of work
It is to be applauded that Parliament can play a part in simplifying the rules
As@@ sa@@ ults are one of the major problems encountered by drivers when they take rest breaks on European motorways
It is more urgent than ever to cooperate on preventing the increasing violence on our motorways
Finally , I wish to draw attention to increased safety on motorways
This is relevant not only to professional drivers but to all of us who drive on European roads
All too often , we have seen accidents caused by tired drivers
The simple new rules would mean that no one could be in any doubt as to when and for how long drivers were required to take rest breaks
It would be easier for the police to monitor that the rules were being complied with
I very much hope that the police would also increase the level of checks they made
What the ELDR Group is displaying here is pen@@ n@@ y-@@ pin@@ ching at its worst
Safety in road freight transport concerns everyone who lives in the EU , because - and the statistics are clear about this - over@@ tiredness at the wheel kills
We Greens think that the working times in this sector , the driving times , need to be reduced
We have tabled an amendment stating that they should be reduced to 80 hours every two weeks with a maximum of 45 to 48 hours in any one week
What we have at the moment is 56 hours per week
That is only the driving time
On top of that there is loading and unloading
There is no other job in industry that presents such a high risk for which we permit such long working hours
In addition , systematic inspections need to be introduced
If you talk to police officers they will tell you that this company card is the only way of effec@@ ting systematic checks on undertakings
Obviously we will have to ensure that this European legislation is respected in the competent overarching bodies , for example in the requirements for C@@ EM@@ T licences
Mr President , Commissioner , opinions on this harmonisation proposal differ sharply
Shi@@ pp@@ ers in particular say that the existing regulation is operating satisfactorily
Changes would have far-reaching consequences for the sector
On the other hand , plenty of reports are appearing which show that the provisions of the regulation are being completely disregarded
On the basis of the first point of view , therefore , no changes are needed , although they are needed on the basis of the second
I think that both interpretations are in some sense correct
In the final analysis there is not so much intrinsically wrong with the regulation
There is , however , something wrong with the way in which Member States interpret and apply the regulation
In order to improve the situation , I believe that intervention in the existing regulation is inevitable
Two starting points are crucial here
Firstly , most of the current provisions can remain intact
Only a few provisions have proved to be open to multiple interpretations
A clear definition must be found for these elements
I therefore support most of the amendments aimed at rein@@ stating the original text
I also support those amendments that clarify the existing ambiguities , like the separate rest periods
Secondly , we must tighten the provisions in respect of control and international coordination
Different interpretations of the regulation by national regulatory authorities obstruct the creation of a level playing field for competition in the European Union
We therefore support the amendments that aim to achieve qualitative and quantitative improvement of the controls
This also applies to amendments that are intended to achieve international harmonisation amongst regulatory authorities
In short , the emphasis must lie on simple , enforceable provisions , adequate controls and identical assessment standards by regulatory authorities
We believe that the report provides a good starting point for this
Mr President , I would like to focus my contribution to this debate on the essence of what the proposal means to people in my constituency
This report , and the original proposal behind it , would have grave implications for business and individuals alike
Even though several important derogations were won in committee , the concept of the proposal remains impractical , untenable and un@@ enforceable
This is why , along with a number of colleagues , I have submitted an amendment which would have the Commission proposal rejected in its entirety
Indeed it seems to me that recent times have seen the transport industry being hit hard by piece after piece of excessive legislation
These requirements about working time prevent professionals from doing their job efficiently by imposing strict terms on when breaks have to be taken
Once again we see Europe ham@@ str@@ inging business rather than liberating it
The introduction of a common range of penalties in particular is worrying
This clearly gives licence to interfere in matters of national sovereignty and national autonomy
Indeed the subsidiarity and extraterritoriality issues apparent in this report are clear examples of the report itself being over-@@ extended
British Conservatives by their very nature oppose such restrictive legislation being piled on business
We believe that this particular piece of legislation is unnecessary , highly excessive and has little relevance to the needs of business and employees alike
I therefore have no hesitation in urging this House to support our key amendment to reject the proposal in its entirety
The fundamental axis of this report is road safety
As some honourable Members have said , lack of safety leads to 40 000 deaths and 1 750 000 injuries per year in the European Union
And there is great consensus on the part of all the groups with regard to the need to achieve the objective of safety
Specifically , we are talking about one of the factors of safety
We are also talking about a very important European small or medium-sized enterprise , the transport enterprise , which we must promote and whose competitiveness we must defend
I believe that this report has important objectives , but we must continue to work on it until we reach a consensus
My country 's geographical situation is such that it is particularly important for us that transport be efficient at the same time as being safe
That is something we must do something about
I should like to add that I very much agree with my fellow MEP , Mr Blak , that we must also look at another problem for drivers
It is important that they be safer when they take their breaks
It is disgraceful that drivers should live in fear of assault and robbery
The Council has accepted that countries must make efforts in this area , and I am looking forward to seeing some practical initiatives soon
We all know that we have had , and still are having , very great problems supervising and enforcing this
, and most particularly the regular occurrence of road accidents with all the consequences of these make it clear that we really have our work cut out
I would like to thank the two rapporteurs , Mr Markov and Mr Andersson , for their constructive collaboration on this work
Of course , this also applies to the reinstatement of a wide range of definitions so that they are not open to multiple interpretations
We do not need flexible week@@ s; difficult definitions of driving times must be replac@@ ed; op@@ ting-@@ out clauses must be restric@@ ted; and enforcement must be intensified
I would , however , particularly like to focus attention on a couple of amendments which we are in favour of
We think that this is an important safety issue
Secondly , the amendment concerning improving checks by linking the digital tacho@@ grap@@ h directive to this regulation
Mr President , in this legislation I detect a worrying and sinister extension of the scope of Community power
It seems to me that the Commission is no longer content just to set harmonised stand@@ ard@@ s; it is now moving firmly into setting standards and priorities for enforcement
Within the narrow confines of this legislation , ensuring standards for adequate enforcement certainly has its own internal logic , but there is more to it than meets the eye
Road transport enforcement is carried out by a variety of agencies , most of which have multiple responsibilities and duties
I will therefore be voting against this regulation
I would normally thank the Commission for a proposal it sends to Parliament , but this time I am not so grateful
I have objections to the proposal concerning driving times and rest periods in road transport in the form in which it was originally sent to Parliament by the Commission
It is time we became aware of the bureaucracy we are causing
Making new regulations does not mean that they will be enforced any better than the old regulations , which were satisfactory but were not enforced either
Many of the new regulations cannot be monitored at all
Other regulations are only being amended on account of the technology used for monitoring , which had worked well for 17 years
An example of legislation that cannot be monitored and is therefore poor is the new attempt to tell self-employed contractors how long they may work
My colleague Ma@@ thi@@ eu Grosch has improved the proposal a great deal , and it will be thanks to him that there will in fact be a directive
what possessed the Commission to come up with such poor legislation in the first place ?
The last thing the sector needs is more new regulations
I know that the European Commission supports attempts to create more extensive and more intelligent monitoring of freight traffic
I also know , however , that cooperation often depends on personal input and sympathies and therefore still takes place on a relatively informal basis
I am therefore grateful to all of the Members who have worked on it in the committees to bring us closer to this objective
Allow me , as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and as someone from a rural constituency , nevertheless to make a number of critical comments
At first sight , the title ' harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport ' does not appear to have any relevance for agriculture policy
However , the Commission proposal contains a number of points which are also important for agriculture
Hitherto these were excluded by virtue of the old Article 13
If cou@@ ri@@ er and express delivery services are frequently involved in serious accidents then it may well be justified to include them in the scope of this regulation
But for milk collection vehicles and tractors to be made subject to provisions of this kind as well does seem to me to be very arbitrary
Article 13 provides for an exemption for the transport of live animals within a 50-@@ kilometre radius
For vehicles transporting animal carcasses and offal there is no such exemption
I view the restrictions that are to be introduced on breakdown vehicles in a similarly critical light
The current regulation , which provided for exemptions in the areas that I have mentioned , certainly did not penalise the weaker members of society , but it was practicable
Thankfully my group has tabled amendments that mitigate some of these shortcomings in the Commission proposal
Anything else just causes bad feeling towards Europe
That would be the responsibility of Mrs Diamantopoulou rather than me
That is not my competence
I am talking about road safety
That is the objective of this proposal
If the social aspect were the primary objective , we would have to consider other issues
I am talking about safety on our roads in the transport sector and , of course , distortions of competition
I would like to make a few general comments on the most important issues which have been raised here today , however
The Commission therefore accepts the amendments - some with modifications to the wording - which clarify the text in this respect
We also accept those amendments - some reworded - which call for improvements in the control and application of the regulations
Mr President , we cannot accept the arguments that this proposal is not necessary , however
The changes therefore have to be incorporated
The Commission will ensure a balance between flexibility and the control of application
We cannot accept those amendments which ask for more controls and imply an excessive increase in administrative burdens
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at 12 noon
Mr President , there was a minor incident yesterday involving myself and the Presidency of the sitting
Pursuant to Rule 122 of the Rules of Procedure , I would like to be given the floor when the Minutes are approved
Can you confirm that the Minutes will be approved at the beginning of this afternoon , as they were not ready this morning ?
Mr Gollnisch , my services tell me that the Minutes will be tabled for approval at 3 p
( The sitting was suspended at 11
and resumed at 12 noon
I will therefore vote against amendments which seek to apply even greater reductions in driving time than contained in the Commission 's proposal
If EU regulations are to be seen as relevant , due account must be taken of the realities facing rural and island communities
The next item is the vote
Mr President , for unfortunate technical reasons the amendments I made to my report have not been tabled
There are two amendments relating to the proposed new draft of Article 3 on the Agency
There is a recital relating to the amendment of Article 29 on safety
There is also another amendment which details my wish to pose the question of funding
Ladies and gentlemen , I would welcome your views on this
Mr President , I think we can make things easier for ourselves
My group opposes the oral amendments
That is why my group opposes all oral amendments to the Ainardi report
In order to follow the procedures correctly , if 32 Members object when we come to the vote there cannot be an oral amendment
When we reach the relevant points in the vote , the House can indicate its preference
Mr President , I just wanted to point out that Amendments Nos 45 and 78 , both of which have been adopted , are contradictory
We actually intended to request a separate vote yesterday , but that all fell through
I should therefore like to inform the administration that both amendments need to be re@@ formulated
Mr President , I would like to question the order decided upon for the votes
In my opinion , Amendment No 9 is the amendment which is furthest from the text adopted in committee
However , it is for the President to decide
Given the level of en@@ tente , I shall also bow to that experience
Mr President , I indicated beforehand that I wished to raise a point of order before the vote on Amendment No 24
I refer to Rule 139 of the Rules of Procedure , which states that amendments have to be distributed and translated
I have various language versions in front of me , none of which contains this particular amendment , Amendment No 24
I would therefore firstly move that the vote should not take place
In any case , Members are free to exercise their independent judgment
I refer here to Rule 2 of the Rules of Procedure
Give us an opportunity actually to vote on the right to bring cases before the court , that is , on the original wording of Paragraph 8
That was due to an electronic problem in our system , which was rectified by yesterday afternoon
Your point does not therefore hold
You are entitled to make such an observation if some language versions are not available
However , since that was addressed yesterday , we will now proceed to the vote on Amendment No 24
Mr President , I would like to call on Mr Méndez de Vigo to withdraw his amendment
He is asking us to make a decision on a crucial issue that I know is very important to the Spanish people
We are indebted to Feli@@ pe González , the former Prime Minister of Spain , for introducing the concept of European citizenship into the Treaties
He was also responsible for developing the concept to such a great extent
I do not however consider this to be a purely linguistic or philosophical issue
It is an issue of crucial importance
It forms the basis of the legitimacy of the European Union
Does Parliament want to discard the traditional definition of a Union of States and of peoples and adopt the concept of a Union of States and citizens ?
Just to clarify matters for the House , Mrs Berès , you have requested that the author withdraw his amendment
Mr President , I do not agree with the last observation by Mrs Berès
It is not a question of having an amendment passed
The concept of the people seems to us to be an archa@@ ic one
We want to talk of citizens , because we want to bring Europe closer to the citizens
I am not therefore withdrawing my amendment and I would ask that it be put to the vote
And I would also ask the Socialist Group to take on board that this is truly the modern way to act and not the old-fashioned one
Once upon a time there was a white do@@ ve
The fairy tale told in this report would not even convince a child that the United States is the only country to subsidise its airlines
Are we to believe that the European Union does not likewise subsidise the European Airbus consortium amongst others
Are we to believe that Member States do not support their airlines , whether they are in public or private hands
The wording of this report is hypocritical and its content scandalous
We did not support it because we are opposed to the so-called compens@@ ations the report recommends
These are actually nothing more than further subsidies for the capitalists of the aviation industry
Above all , we reject your entire system based on competition and commercial conflict , which come at a high cost to society
Air travel has become cheaper and cheaper over the last few decades
In addition to the traditional national air carriers , a number of other airlines have entered the arena offering conspic@@ uously cheap rates
Some of these companies come from outside the EU
What is now being proposed is aimed at these companies from outside the EU
They are often based in countries in the developing world or countries in the former Soviet Union
These are poor countries that think that they can make money as low-cost competitors in the European market
For example , the Braz@@ ili@@ an airline V@@ ari@@ g flies people very cheaply between Amsterdam and Paris
We need to act on this , not least because these companies make unnecessary amounts of noise and apply less stringent safety standards
Bar@@ ring these companies , however , is only part of the solution
The low-cost airlines based inside the EU , like R@@ y@@ an@@ air , E@@ asy@@ jet , Vir@@ gin and Ger@@ man@@ wings have been ignored
The freedom from taxation enjoyed by the airlines , which gives them an unfair competitive advantage over international rail travel , likewise remains in place
The proposals on which we are voting today are therefore a half-@@ measure that inf@@ licts the pain one-sidedly on other countries
I am voting in favour of this proposal , but I think that it is one-sided and inadequate
When will we see the essential other part that puts an end to the risks associated with the low-cost airlines ?
In principle , I regard the Commission 's proposal for a regulation as something to be welcomed
I hope that these points can be examined closely during the remainder of the proceedings
It goes without saying that political considerations have no place in such an area '
Our response mechanisms need to be made far more flexible
Mr President , I am sleeping very well at the moment and I have had a lot of dreams
It was an anim@@ ated , very con@@ vivi@@ al game
' The railways must be developed
He was illustrating his report , pleading ze@@ alously and ast@@ u@@ tely the cause of the development of the railways in Europe
He spoke so eloquently that he convinced me to vote for his report
I will tell you what the other players were saying when their turn comes
A complete opening up of the market for national rail passenger services by no later than 1 January 2008 must take place under certain basic conditions
Moreover , there must be guarantees of safety , quality and social rights before railways can be purchased
In particular , the process would introduce instability and uncertainty into a market that requires technological solutions and a high level of long-term investment
We are aware that , on the one hand , public services must ensure that they treat all their users throughout the country equally , regardless of their individual circumstances
On the other hand , opening up the sector to competition could reduce or even do away altogether with any such concept of public service
We therefore oppose all moves towards liberalisation unless it is first proved that it will have genuine added value
The current situation in a number of Member States demonstrate the shortcomings of a system whose sole aim is to make the greatest possible profit
Unfortunately the Commission has not taken account of the consequences of such a system
They can easily be quantified but have been disguised for purely dogmatic reasons
This is why we voted against the Jarzembowski report
With this rail package the European Commission is proposing a new version of Directive 91/@@ 4@@ 40 , which seeks to increase the liberalisation of rail services , in particular for freight
The amendments of the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism broadened its scope to include the liberalisation of passenger services as well
I will vote against both these measures
We should ask why we are speeding up the liberalisation process when the 1991 directive has only just been revised
We should ask why we are reconsidering an agreement , a balanced agreement , reached with some difficulty just over a year ago
The Member States have not even finished the transposition of the revised directive of 2001
This means that we are moving ahead with liberalisation , with no going back , before we have even assessed the effects of the beginning of the process
It is simplistic to assert that the main reason why rail has become less competitive than road transport for freight is because the sector has not been liberalised
We did not have to liberalise rail passenger services to achieve cooperation between national operators in the case of Th@@ al@@ ys
What works for passenger services could be applied to and developed for freight services
The will must be there though , and European and national investment at the ready
Let us go for rail rather than for lorries
It entails the risk that profitable trans-European lines would be monopolised by a number of big operators , while less profitable secondary networks would be left to small operators
Thus far , the Commission has failed to present an assessment of the consequences of rail liberalisation and the separation of rail infrastructure and operations
This proposal for complete liberalisation is very premature
The proposals for a second railway package set in motion important initiatives towards strengthening Europe 's railway system
Opening rail freight services within Member States , and accelerating the process of opening up the international ones , represent a significant step towards deregulating the railway sector
Di@@ ver@@ ting the flow of European freight traffic can succeed in the long term only if railways are high-@@ performing and competitive
The planned harmonisation of the European railway network is therefore to be welcomed , provided that a maximum of safety in rail travel can be guaranteed
In the same dream , Mr President , still at the Pal@@ a@@ is de l' Europe cas@@ ino , another player at the table was Mr Sterckx
Now , Mr Sterckx was dressed as a cyclist
Listening to this , I could only vote for Mr Sterckx ' excellent report the next morning , as , indeed , I have done
The claim that a so-called Community safety system will be developed at best reflects your concern given the likely scenario
Private interests will be concerned with maximising their profits
They will not prioritise investment in human resources and materials to ensure adequate safety standards
In truth , you only refer to the issue of safety to ensure that ' additional national requirements ' cannot ' restrict market access '
The safety standards you refer to are minimum standards , which will lead to disasters on the railways
We rejected the report and we maintain that the public service ethos of rail services should not be altered
We are also opposed to the concept of public service being lost in the pursuit of profit
I am delighted to see what excellent safety indicators the European railway system has
The report before us describes a package for the liberalisation of railway services , which is intended to take place by 2008
It is my belief that liberalisation would leave us with nothing but a ceme@@ tery filled with passengers
The Jarzembowski report advocates speeding up the liberalisation of both freight and passenger services
The report 's lack of realism and its relentless pursuit of ideas despite the evidence are frightening
In outlining his vision of liberalisation , the author has overlooked the time needed to alter structures and has totally neglected both the social and the human factors
D@@ reams outlined on paper , especially those concerning liberalisation , often turn into nightmares for those who have to implement them
The Sterckx report presents a vision of a standardised safety system achieved through harmonising rules and procedures and so on
Although this would be useful , unfortunately the report makes safety standards subject to profit imperatives and completely neglects the issue of working conditions
To prevent the liberalisation process leading to communication problems , railway@@ men must communicate in terms everyone can understand , as is the case for air transport
I would have no objection to this if railway@@ men were selected and paid in the same way as pilots are
This would actually be good news for all rail workers , but I doubt it could really happen
This being the case , I cannot support these two reports
She was extremely elegant and beautiful and surrounded by many young admi@@ rers , but when it came to her turn to play , she always said , ' Pass '
See how much less time the game takes if there are no breaks
Of course , therefore , I could not fail to vote for the Ainardi report
We do of course support the interoperability of the trans-European rail system and some of the measures proposed in this report
The measures relating to interoperability are however contained in a rail package which prop@@ ounds extending competition to the rail transport sector and opening it up to privatisation
The report stresses long-term profitability and is expresses concern about a reduction in the competitiveness of rail transport
It does not however take a clear stand against privatisation and competition or against the consequent dismantling of a public service
In essence , this report reflects policies that seek to do away with public services
We therefore abstained from the vote on this report
I must congratulate Mrs Ainardi on her excellent work
Her report is part of a ' rail package ' that seeks to promote the development of the rail sector through the creation of an integrated rail system
This would involve achieving the interoperability of the trans-European rail system , crucial to ensure that international traffic can flow freely
Until now , the fact that different countries have very different specifications and technical standards , that are often incompatible , has created difficulties in using rail transport
As a strong supporter of the railways , I think this is a deplorable situation
It has repercussions for both the protection of the environment and passenger safety
I therefore very much welcome the Commission 's proposal to attempt to coordinate the different TS@@ Is
That said , safety standards must never be harmonised to a lower level
Advoc@@ ates of the concept of public service must keep an eag@@ le eye on these issues , given the prevailing philosophy on this subject
My name is Savary , as derived from the words ' safe ' and ' save '
I am in the best position to make the railways safe
The Markov report organises , inter alia , the working hours and rest periods of drivers engaged in the carriage of goods and passengers by road
Well then , my proposal is as follows
My figures might not be exact but I believe the concept is clear
I welcome the opportunity given to us at first reading to make a sensible contribution to a regulation on social provision that is clearer , safer , and more controllable
I hope that , from 2004 , the digital tacho@@ grap@@ h will prevent black sheep from finding new bol@@ th@@ ol@@ es
This measure might consequently considerably reduce social dumping while encouraging third countries to strengthen their national legislation to improve working conditions for their drivers
It is sickening , however , that a text entitled ' social legislation ' would allow drivers to work 5@@ 6-@@ hour weeks
Furthermore , we feel it is unacceptable to make the situation worse in countries with higher levels of protection in order to improve it in others
The only acceptable form of harmonisation would standardise social protection and working conditions to the highest level
Whilst this proposal was submitted in the name of safety and simplification , its contents provide for little more than further bureaucracy and regulation
We are particularly concerned about the effect that these measures would have on mini@@ buses operated by the voluntary and non-commercial sectors
Changes to rest requirements and driving times will severely reduce the ability of schools and co@@ ach companies to offer trips abroad at an economically viable rate
These proposals impose further burdens on an industry that is already heavily regulated , yet the Commission fails to provide any cost-benefit analyses to justify its arguments
The British Government has described many of these proposals as being either unnecessary or disproportionate to any benefit
We are happy to support this line and trust that they will act accordingly when these measures are considered by the Council
This proposal also aims to make the current rules compatible with the use of new digital recording equipment in order to improve compliance with the rules in force
The rapporteur , however , has also succeeded in introducing amendments which I consider to be crucial
On the other hand , the rapporteur did not achieve a vote in favour of the amendment rightly proposing to reduce the working week to 45 hours
We fully agree that there is a need to harmonise social legislation on road transport
Our concern is not to prevent distortion of competition with third countries , but to guarantee lorry drivers the best pay , status and working conditions
We cannot be content with half-@@ measures in this sector , which has been abandoned to capitalist brutality
It is right to oppose the flexible week , restrict working times and specify the minimum age of drivers engaged in the carriage of goods
We need to increase controls , penalise employers who fail to comply with the provisions of the regulation and increase the participation of the social partners
The Markov report , however , does not go far enough with regard to weekly driving time and the possibility of dividing breaks
It is insufficient to reduce the weekly driving time , which is currently set at 56 hours , to 45 hours
It is unacceptable to authorise the division of rest time
These two measures perpetuate the fact that drivers are employees who are forced to break the law for greater market profits
That is why , although we are in favour of progressive social measures , we did not , in the end , vote for this report
Decisions on safety are usually preceded by fatal accidents
Other considerations are all given priority until regulation becomes unavoidable , and then the emphasis is on freedom for business , limiting costs and free competition
Yet everyone knew beforehand that allowing professional drivers to drive too long would result in accidents
Unfortunately that has never stopped people in this industry from being allowed to work for longer consecutive periods than in other industries where less harm can be caused
Businesses want to avoid taking on a second driver and avoid waiting times at all costs , as these measures cost money
What is more , drivers want to be protected against over@@ working and over@@ tiredness , but they also want to get home quickly after a long trip
Self-@@ employed drivers even believe that they are exempt from the regulations , and businesses who want to exploit this have sold their lorries to their drivers
If we give in to such counter@@ forces , honest hauliers and the railways will be driven out of business
We were happy to vote for the Markov report
These measures deserve our approval , given that they will make a serious contribution to improving road safety
However , we very much regret that a majority of Members of this House did not support the rapporteur 's proposal to reduce weekly driving time to 45 hours
We nevertheless hope that the Commission and the Council will be sufficiently open-minded towards the amendments that have now been adopted
The Convention has been rather silent on this point
Given the phenomena of region@@ alism , devolution and decentralisation present throughout Europe , the importance of the regions is clear in practical terms
These are issues to which the Convention will have to return for the good of region@@ alism
I did so because local authorities in regions play a vital role in implementing European law
Given that role , I felt it was right that they should have a say in the adoption of European law
The Napolitano report takes that principle and moves it forward in the context of today 's Europe
I welcome what Mr Napolitano has argued for in terms of the higher status of regions and local authorities in European decision-making
But I also accept that he is right to do that in a non-@@ prescriptive way that does not interfere with the internal constitutions of the Member States
By making a case for the regions but leaving it to the individual Member States to decide how to implement his recommendations , he has struck the right balance
For example , we have just heard an argument for regions to be involved in the Council of Ministers
I support that argument , but each Member State must do that in the context of its own constitution
Finally , the one weakness in the Napolitano report is that it has not given enough emphasis to the role of regions with legislative authority
I hope that the Commission will look at that and find a way of engaging them more coherently in EU activities
Mr President , like other speakers , I am glad that in relation to the Napolitano report we have moved forward on some important points
It is recognised that , in appropriate constitutional circumstances , regions will have access to the Court of Justice
There are some points I regret
I particularly regret that the opportunity was not taken to comment about the odd composition of the Committee of the Regions
This is not a satisfactory situation
The Committee of the Regions is supposed to counterbalance the Parliament
The balance of populations and regions on the Committee of the Regions is not at all a reasonable one
Mr President , last night , I dreamed about Mr Napolitano too
I therefore voted for the motion
Unfortunately , numerous votes in plenary have damaged this remarkable work
Mr Méndez de Vigo replied that the concept of ' people ' was outdated
That , in fact , is what the right has continually repeated in Europe over previous centuries and it is not convincing
I feel that this is an area in which , in any case , it is for the Member States to decide
Mr President , I knew that Mr Méndez de Vigo was reactionary on issues of European diversity , but I did not know that he was so ignorant
Mr Méndez de Vigo 's statement conflicts with the constitution of the United States , and also with the views of his bos@@ s , José Maria Aznar
What we ask is why Malta and not Galicia ?
Stat@@ eless nations very often have a history , a political will and a demo@@ graphy that justify this participation
Naturally , the committee members who voted for these provisions were then dis@@ owned by their groups , and Parliament has just made corrections in plenary
It has only , however , ironed out the most obvious problems
The rest , which by@@ passes the Member States more insidi@@ ously , has been retained
These mistakes have simply brought to light the direction this report would take if it were implemented
This kind of development would change the nature of the Union and make it more similar to a Nation@@ -@@ State
We have therefore voted against this report
We would point out , however , that the content of the amendments must not be included in a possible future European constitution but be included in a future treaty
The June Movement does not , in fact , wish to see a European constitution that will take precedence over the national constitutions
The Member States are not homogenous
They range from federal states to centralised unitary states
The Committee of the Regions lacks democratic legitimacy , and we believe it should be phased out , not developed
With the democratic deficit in today 's EU , it is more important first and foremost to develop the role of the national parliaments
It is in actual fact states , and not regions , that are members of the EU
The Socialist amendment , proposing that the case should be presented through the intermediary of the State , was not much better
The Napolitano report , however , still contains some very positive aspects and I have therefore decided to vote in favour of it tomorrow
For that reason , we support those aspects that the report emphasises in this respect
We cannot agree with this , because internal organisation is a matter for the Member States alone , especially when it comes to how decisions are made
I would like to congratulate Gi@@ or@@ gi@@ o Napolitano on his excellent and timely report on the role of regional and local authorities in the building of Europe , which I support
Nevertheless , I believe that these links should be established at the level of individual Member States
I very much support Mr Napolitano 's desire for consolidation of Article 299 of the EC Treaty , which concerns the outermost regions
The argument put forward , that of bringing the Union closer to the citizens , is misleading
One of the key questions addressed in this report is , quite rightly , the role of the Committee of the Regions
The report stresses the legitimacy and the vital role of this committee as an institutional partner for regional and local authorities within the framework of the Union
I accordingly voted against the report
However , one important positive point in this report is the recommendation that Article 299 of the EC Treaty , which relates to the outermost regions , should be consolidated
I have voted in favour of this report
The Minutes of Monday 's sitting have been distributed
Mr President , allow me to reassure you right away
I , like other Members , asked to speak in relation to the setting of the agenda
This speech does indeed , therefore , concern the agenda
Mr Provan cut me off before I could finish my one-@@ minute speech , which prevented him from understanding that this speech was indeed about setting the agenda
I can , at a pinch , understand how Mr Provan could have misunderstood me on this matter
In particular , I think I was the first to want to speak on the proposal made by one speaker with regard to setting the agenda on North Korea
Mr Provan conspic@@ uously disregarded my request for the floor , even though I was the first to make such a request
Lastly , pursuant to Rule 1@@ 21 of our Rules of Procedure , I was also entitled to speak for one minute
I had an assistant check that I was indeed listed
I find this interpretation to be somewhat offensive
The next item is the Council statement on the work programme of the Greek Presidency
I thank him and his ministerial and public service colleagues for that meeting
We look forward to working closely and productively with the Greek Presidency
It gives me great pleasure to call upon the Prime Minister to make his opening statement
The Greek Presidency plans to cooperate with Parliament to the maximum possible extent at all levels
It plans to cooperate not merely as a formality , but because cooperation is , I believe , a necessary and fundamental factor in achieving our joint objectives
We shall grab every possible opportunity for fruitful cooperation between us
Greece is one of the countries which believes that developing the European Union will help to strengthen the role and authority of the European Parliament
Ladies and gentlemen , this is an historic phase in the ongoing development of Europe
All of us , the Council , Parliament , the Commission and our citizens , are expected to help with this phase
A Europe which creates the potential for everyone to grow and prosper , which strengthens every country 's society , and which promotes cohesion and solidarity
A Europe which , in a multipolar global system , works for peace , cooperation and justice
Working in this direction is not our only responsibility
At the same time , we need to turn our attention to the international crises that create insecurity
International crises which originate in the fragile states on the fr@@ inges of the Union , international crises rooted in the Middle East , international crises caused by international terrorism
What we need is a Europe which has a constant presence and speaks with one clear voice on the international stage
We did precisely that and I should like to comment on our five main sets of priorities
It goes without saying that our first priority post Copenhagen is enlargement
We need to continue with all the basic , procedural arrangements so that the accession treaties can be signed in Athens on 16 April
Your role is paramount in these arrangements because the European Parliament has to assent to the accession of the new Member States
At the same time , we shall continue negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania in application of the new pre-accession strategy for these two countries
Our aim is to keep to the timetable for their accession in 2007
We shall be actively working on Turkey 's progress towards accession
Greece believes that Turkey should take its place in Europe on the basis of the decisions already taken by the European Councils
We must give Turkey the opportunity to carry out the reforms its country needs
That is why the Copenhagen European Council decided to follow a strategy , a plan aimed at starting accession negotiations with Turkey
The next two years will be crucial here
I should like to comment at this point on the question of Cyprus
We want Cyprus to join the European Union as a united country
We want it to overcome and resolve its political problem
We want the two communities to share a common future and enjoy the benefits accession has to offer
We felt right from the start that the Annan plan gave Cyprus a chance to resolve its political problem
We have been working along these lines and we hope that a solution will be found by 28 February
Our second priority is to reform the European economy and promote social cohesion
The spring summit in 2003 will be held in a political and economic climate beset with both problems and opportunities
The introduction of the euro last year was an historic process
We believe that , although progress has been made , the Lisbon strategy is now more topical than ever
We need to implement the economic decisions taken over recent years which we have not done enough to promote
This is a vital opportunity to update the European economic and social model
Ladies and gentlemen , we shall be working on six issues
First , macro-economic policy; we want a reliable European economic policy , an intergovernmental economic policy in Europe
Secondly , we want to create more and better jobs
This will help to consolidate social solidarity and cohesion
It is important that we review the European Employment Strategy and a debate on the subject will allow us to make more of the social pillar in the Lisbon strategy
Our third aim within the Lisbon framework is to encourage entrepreneurship and support small enterprises
The presidency sets great store by support for entrepreneurship , which is important to economic development , not to mention employment and regional development
Our fourth aim is to build up the European economy of knowledge and innovation , because we cannot achieve the Lisbon objectives unless we develop knowledge and technology
As you all know , a number of issues are still pending , such as the Community patent , and we intend to try and w@@ rap them up
The presidency will also be tackling other issues , such as developing research in cutting-edge technologies , including defence research
Our sixth aim is to safeguard future prosperity through sustainability
This mainly means reviewing the Union 's strategy on sustainable development in the light of the outcome of the world summit in Johannesburg
We want to make more of the Union 's leading role in environmental protection
So much , ladies and gentlemen , for our second set of priorities which relates to the Lisbon strategy
Our third set of priorities covers the sensitive issue of immigration , illegal immigration , external borders and asylum
We all know that immigration in one form or another has now taken on such proportions that we are forced to act
And we need to act in two directions
That it becomes a multicultural area of understanding for man 's problems , that we fight the causes of problems such as poverty , falling living standards and political suppression
We hope here to adopt directives on the reunification of families of long-standing immigrants
In the asylum sector , we want to push ahead with directives such as directives on refugees
Our fourth set of priorities concerns a matter which has already taken up a great deal of our time and energy
We believe that the enlargement of Europe should go hand in glove with greater European unification
Our institutional system needs efficient , democratic functions and policies which reach our citizens
what route will the Convention on the future of Europe take and how will this fit in with the work of the presidency ?
First , we want to carry out a review without taking any decisions , because that would prejudge the outcome of the Convention
Our fifth set of priorities concerns the Union 's international profile and strengthening its role on the international stage
The European Union has proceeded in leaps and bounds with its common security and defence policy
What we now need is to ensure that we have full operational readiness in the crisis management sector by developing our military and non-military capabilities
We therefore intend to concentrate on achieving the general military objective and finalising permanent arrangements for collaboration between the ? U and ? ? ? ?
Over and above this defence policy , we need to examine relations with the Union 's neighbours in order to ensure that no new divisions are created
We may have to deal with war with Iraq over coming months
We want peace
However , we are giving this issue our utmost attention , and rightly so@@ ; it is one of our priorities
We want to work and we shall work for peace and a peaceful resolution to any differences
We trust efforts by the UN will have a positive outcome
The will and the resolutions of the United Nations must prevail
Iraq has to respect and apply Security Council resolutions
The presidency wants to speak for Europe as a union of countries with a common , strong voice and opinions
We need to break our old habit of having different countries saying different things and seeking different objectives
Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to finish by commenting briefly on two or three matters of particular interest to the European Parliament
A great deal of work has been done and we have spent a fair amount of time discussing this
I think this issue is ripe for a final solution and we shall endeavour to reach a solution at the European Council in Thessaloniki
Secondly , the interinstitutional agreement on improving European Union legislation , which has done a great deal to improve the quality of legislation
We hope that there will be agreement here too during our presidency
Thirdly , and lastly , we shall endeavour to complete the rules on European political parties , which are well overdue
I have commented on a number of central issues , although there are a great many other important issues
We want the Greek Presidency to give extra momentum to the development of the Union
Mr President , honourable Members of the European Parliament , I look forward to the best possible collaboration with you
The success of the presidency depends on it
The success of the European Union depends on it
So let us put our heads together and deal with the problems
This coming year will in many respects be equally crucial
In 2003 , we will have to prepare to implement enlargement and we will have to carry out the institutional reforms
Above all , we must provide the new Europe with much more solid economic and social foundations
This was clear throughout your speech
Of course , this does not mean that they do not have an equally strong desire to combat terrorism , to present a united front before this new threat
However , war is considered to be the last resort and our peacekeeping measures must therefore be strong and unified
There can be no objection to that and there is no need for clarification
I would like to thank the Greek Commissioner , Mrs Diamantopoulou , wholeheartedly , for she really has done some absolutely first rate work in this area
The Spring Report is a general report which does not just outline our programme but enters into specific aspects of it
The Lisbon strategy seeks to achieve far-reaching economic and social renewal by the end of the decade and will be the right course for an enlarged European Union too
That means - and we must not forget it - that it does not lose any of its value with enlargement but actually becomes more important
We must not be discouraged by these challenges
The Lisbon process is already starting to bear fruit
This time last year , I laid stress on the unsustainable delivery gap between agreement on policy and action to turn policy into legislation
Thanks to the combined efforts of Parliament , the Commission and the Council , this gap has now been reduced
However , a similar gap is now forming in the area of the transposition of Community directives and decisions into Member States ' law
Thus , the problem of the practical implementation of these decisions is still partly to be resolved
Moreover , many of the national policy reforms which are necessary for the achievement of the Lisbon objectives still remain to be implemented
On the other hand , it is encouraging to see that there are Member States meeting and even exceeding many of the Lisbon objectives
Progress has not been uniform throughout Europe , however
The unsatisfactory performance of some countries is holding back the overall development of the Union
They will all benefit from macroeconomic stability , growth , more jobs and social inclusion
We will make a good team
Ladies and gentlemen , the Lisbon strategy is an integrated strategy for sustainably boosting the European Union 's economy and meeting the major medium and long-term challenges before us
This is why , today , in the context of our strategy , I want to highlight the importance of investment in knowledge and innovation
We have made it our priority for this year
we must help each other to avoid making this mistake
I am speaking so emphatically , if you will , because remarkable things are happening in the world
Thus , knowledge and innovation are the driving force of sustainable development
Without investment and innovation , we will not achieve growth and we will not be able to maintain our present levels of prosperity
computers in our schools , lifelong learning , skilled , flexible employment
It is vital that we promote research into world-@@ beating products and clean technologies , and we must help businesses turn knowledge into commercial opportunities
In my opinion , it is at precisely this last step - converting discoveries into innovation and exploiting them commercially - that European businesses fall down
We still have far fewer researchers than the United States or Japan
Lev@@ els of public expenditure on education and research and development vary too greatly throughout the Union
Businesses need a dynamic environment that will stimulate this economic activity
Today , in Europe , such conditions are not widespread enough
This is critical , for it means that researchers and resources are staying outside the Union
Clearly , we must invest in the future
The accession of the candidate countries with their strong skills base will offer the Union enormous opportunities
Yet this represents a 25 % increase in applied scientists and engineers
In many cases , they are working in specific sectors , but once part of the European circuit , they will genuinely be able to give us great impetus
In this connection , the Commission will be launching an action plan for research and development
Before I conclude , I would like , if I may , to make another personal observation
The United States are succeeding by using human resources from all over the world
Ladies and gentlemen , we have clear responsibilities towards our present and future citizens and towards the whole world in this field
We set ourselves the target of creating a competitive , knowledge-based society based on sustainable growth
On our success will hang the future of the European social model too
Mr President , Prime Minister , time and time again , the European Union has conf@@ ounded the most sceptical critics with bold , resolute initiatives
Quite frankly , the present generations have fewer opportunities , fewer options than most of us sitting here had
I believe it is our duty to restore to them these options , these opportunities , for they are entitled to them and we need them too
No , I said you were the bourgeo@@ is party
Look , whenever Mr Cohn-Bendit but@@ ts in , we lose time for debate
I want to make it clear that I say this with the agreement of our Greek friends , and Mr Trakatellis will speak immediately after me
We wish to strongly encourage you to seize the initiative in relation to the Mediterranean region and the Barcelona process
Governments themselves must also help , of course
Any initiative by you in this area would meet with our full support
Speaking on behalf of the PPE half of our group , I can say that we want a European constitution
We want a European constitution , we want European democracy , we want Europe to have capacity to act , and we want it to be transparent
And such a Europe must rest on the foundations of the Community Europe
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , we are sure that you support that too
Let me move on to the Lisbon process
Such a Europe must become more competitive , and so working in it must again be made worth the effort
So let your coordinating efforts be directed towards tax cuts for businesses , reform of the labour market , and reform of our social security systems
There are two important foreign policy issues , Mr President-in-Office of the Council; Iraq is one of them
We support your efforts towards a common European position on this issue , on the basis of action by the United Nations
No , any European policy must be a responsible one , and I would encourage you , and us , to go about it as Europeans , and together
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you mentioned cooperation with Russia , and in May of this year you will be travelling to a meeting in St Petersburg
Ap@@ p@@ alling things are currently happening in Chechnya
The Russian Government 's unwillingness to extend the OSCE mandate in Chechnya violates the humanitarian principles that we share
That is why we have to speak in a loud voice , and I would encourage you to do just that in St Petersburg
Two inventions dating back 2 500 years which are foundation stones of the current Europe
And the Olympics were the first organised system of peace
All they need is access to the airport , but work is being done on that
And you have also mentioned some other important challenges
We entirely support any action you may take with a view to supporting the policy of Kofi Annan and we believe this is a very decisive step
We are counting on your intelligence and flexibility
You have also held the Presidency of the monetary union since the middle of last year
In this regard , I would like to say that it is important that we increase our economic coordination
This is one of the Greek Presidency 's responsibilities
I would also address the President of the Commission
Mr Prodi , why do you not propose a world-wide Socrates in order to attract brains ?
This falls within the competence of the Commission and of course we in Parliament would support a proposal of this nature
You have more than half the Community 's gross tonnage and plenty of experience
You have spoken of sustainable development and the protection of the environment
All of this must be integrated into a European maritime area , which could be one of the Greek Presidency 's great pieces of work
Under the Greek Presidency , we want the Convention to prepare a draft Constitution
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you must defend the Community method , which has allowed us to come this far , and which can inspire and organise our future
In this regard , Mr President-in-Office , and I will end here , please also continue an active policy in the Middle East
It is very important , everything is related , and you are our border with that region
It is essential that we are able to re-launch the Middle East peace process
I wish you lots of luck
Mr President , I have heard it said that there is nothing left for the Greek Presidency , other than providing the after-sales service for Copenhagen
Nothing could be further from the truth
The Greek Presidency will have a key role in the birth of a reformed and enlarged European Union
But to ensure a smooth birth a good mid@@ wife is essential and I am pleased to see that the Greek Presidency seems well prepared to play that role
With regard to the reform of the Union , the Convention is due to report in Thessaloniki
It is also important to ensure that the baby is not strang@@ led at birth by Member States fearful of an ambitious constitutional Treaty
I would therefore take issue with the President-in-Office and say we should not have a lengthy interim period
We need a short IGC , which should be a ti@@ d@@ y@@ ing-up exercise to ratify quickly the outcome of the Convention quickly
2003 will be the year when politicians must sell enlargement to the voters
Nine out of ten of the new countries will have referenda between March and September this year
We hope in particular that the Greek Presidency can use its privileged relationship with many on the island of Cyprus to ensure that a united island joins our Union
I welcome the generous aspirations that you have expressed today in that regard
If the European Union is to succeed , however , for its current citizens and its new ones , it will need reform
The continued economic slow-down is making structural reform more , not less , urgent and governments should not be def@@ lec@@ ted from the goals they set themselves
That is something we would do very well
Europe is of course though far more than a common market and your presidency recognises this
The Amsterdam and Nice Treaties have created a Community of values
I welcome the emphasis in your presidency 's statement on the values of a generous , outw@@ ar@@ d-@@ looking and civilised society
You speak in your document of a planned legal immigration policy
Ex@@ posed as you are on Europe 's southern and eastern f@@ lan@@ ks , you see the importance of understanding a little more and condemning a little less
We need many of them to deal with the problems of an ageing population here , or the brain drain problems the Commission President referred to
Let us work to close the back door to illegal immigration more effectively by offering legal opportunities to those wishing to settle here and integrating them properly in our society
I had a great deal to say about Iraq and the Middle East peace process as well , but my time is running short
I would , however , say that the Greeks are well acquainted with what we in the rest of Europe understand by the word ' marathon '
We wish you good speed in the marathon that you are running on our behalf
There must be no war with Iraq
Fortunately , the Greek Presidency of the Council is taking the opposite line
You have our entire support in your efforts to prevent war , in the teeth of the Bush administration 's declared intentions
Most of all , the Member States must be willing to counteract the looming economic crisis in Europe
It is willingness to reform the Stability Pact that we regard as the litmus test in this regard
Be bold enough to do it
In conclusion , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I wish to endorse your objective of speeding up the Convention 's reforming work
This is another area where the public interest demands that tangible progress be made , especially towards creating social Europe
Let us begin with the Iraqi crisis
No , Mr Poettering , you are wrong when you say that we cannot do this or that
To date , there is no proof of renewed aggression from the dictator Saddam Hussein
If the secret services have proof , they should announce it in all the newspapers
If they have proof of what Saddam Hussein possesses , he must also know
If that is the case , therefore , it is not a secret from anyone in Iraq , nor from Saddam Hussein
I do not , therefore , understand this strategy
We must have the courage to say what we expect from the Security Council and I believe the European Union has a decisive role to play in this regard
We said ' yes '
One part of my group was in fact against this , but I have always said ' yes ' , to the need for military intervention in Afghanistan and Kosovo
Today , however , all those who said ' yes ' to intervention in these two cases must say ' no ' to pointless intervention
We must tell the Security Council this
France and the United Kingdom have a right of veto which would prevent this intervention
That is the Plat@@ onic logic currently being applied by Washington
I would ask Athens to say ' no ' to this completely crazy thinking
I would now like to address the matter of the Spring Summit and sustainable development
I agree , but what are the relevant indicators with regard to the environment , the economy and social issues ?
These indicators must be equal
In Sal@@ on@@ ika , we therefore need to draw up a genuine list of indicators and a strategy to assess and put into perspective sustainable development
That would truly be an historic initiative , a first
There are numerous proposals here and there , but nothing more
You spoke of maritime safety - fine
Where do the responsibilities lie , however , in environmental terms ?
Who will pay for the Erika ?
Who will pay for the Prestige ?
EUR 11 million were paid out by those responsible for the Erika
It is scandalous because those responsible for maritime disasters should pay for everything
They must take on the entire risk and until they are forced to shoulder their responsibility , all the responsibility , they will do whatever they like
You know what I am talking about , since Greece is one of the countries that has the most responsibilities in this sector
Lastly , you spoke of Cyprus
Naturally , you want a united Cyprus
In that case , however , both Turkey and Greece need to approach the problem of Greek and Turkish nationalism
The Cypriot people , the populations of the north and the south , do not want the same thing as their representatives
I therefore believe that together we must all have the strength and courage to provide a future for people who want this future
In conclusion , you would truly be Socrates and P@@ la@@ to combined if you succeeded in solving the problem of the status of Members of Parliament
If you achieve this , you may be my guest at the Par@@ is@@ ian restaurant of your choice , as you will have become a grand master in politics
The Greek Government is assuming the presidency of the European Union at a time of great international uncertainty
It is very important that the United Nations is the organisation that deals with international security issues
This is certainly a very ambitious political objective but I fully support it and I am sure the majority of Members of this House do as well
The European economy is not performing very well at present and the Greek Presidency is correct to accelerate the Lisbon Process
We need to make European businesses more competi@@ tive; more support mechanisms must be put in place to assist small - and medium-sized enterprises
The Greek Presidency is also making illegal immigration in Europe a priority
When it comes to protecting the borders of the European Union , a common approach is needed at EU level
Certainly we are going to have to reform under the EU Convention how we legislate for issues such as immigration , asylum , refugees , displaced persons and European visas
As has been mentioned , the Convention will now be reporting to European governments during the Greek Presidency of the Union
These treaties are being prepared and referenda will then be held in the applicant states
It is very clear that there are wide-ranging and diverse issues that will have to be addressed by the Greek Presidency of the European Union
The spectre of a conflict in Iraq hangs over us all like the sword of Damocles and that is something that we all need to have in mind
Mr President , k@@ alis@@ per@@ a , the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities would also like to welcome the Greek Presidency
Greece was the cradle of democracy
That means you have a special duty to give the EU a democratic overhaul
This is our advice
Open up all meetings in which you debate laws
Give the European Parliament and the national parliaments access to all papers from the Council 's working parties
Intro@@ duce public access to documents according to the principle of best practice among the countries
Pl@@ ace all agendas and minutes from the Council 's working parties on the Presidency 's web site
Give the Ombudsman a new statute , giving him or her access to everything for monitoring purposes
Give the Court of Auditors the access required for monitoring both the Commission and the organisations that use EU funds
Re@@ tain the rotating Presidency so that each country has six months in which to pull out all the stops
Keep the EU and the military separate and prepare reforms of agriculture , the structural funds and the budget so that we are ready to receive the new countries
The next few years , and certainly the next few decades , will be of great significance to all European people , but primarily to the European Union
The Greek Presidency must therefore not simply be allowed to be the umpteenth routine presidency
To give this country a prospect of acceding to the European Union is , however , complete madness
The Greek Presidency is being given an historic opportunity here
Take the initiative , for example , or suggest holding a referendum on Turkey 's candidature in all our European countries
Why should the electorates of democracies not have their say on something that is so crucial to our very existence ?
If you do not , my party in Flanders will turn the European elections in 2004 into a referendum on Turkey 's accession
It is striking that the German Christian-Democrats are also more or less announcing the same thing
Mr President , I would like to welcome both the President of the Council and the President of the Commission here this afternoon
I want to talk specifically about jobs , competitiveness and the internal market
Both of the Presidents have a crucial responsibility to the global economy over the next six months
You do not need to wait for the Commission to take that initiative to create jobs and move the European economy forward , we look to you to do it
Mr President , my thanks go to Greece for an excellent presentation and for highlighting some delicate matters
Recently , actually since the autumn , it has been mainly the issues of enlargement and the Convention that have been the focus of attention at EU level
In its presentation Greece mentioned some well-@@ chosen issues it intends to address over the next six months
Unfortunately , however , we cannot cure all the ills of the world even though we might want to
We should also be as good as our word with regard to improving European competitiveness , something that was endorsed at Lisbon
Things have , however , gone the opposite way
The United States of America has rushed off even further into the distance
There is barely any eye contact anymore
If there is , the Americans come whist@@ ling past one lap of the circuit ahead of us whatever the event , to use a sports image
These steps must be based on a new UN resolution and must concentrate on eliminating any problems encountered
At this historic moment our Group of the Party of European Socialists is asking the Greek Presidency to clearly state that this is also the position of the European Union
We are now asking for leadership from Europe , so that Europe speaks with one voice
We must do our utmost to prevent war in Iraq and at the same time engage in serious peace negotiations in the Middle East
The two-@@ state solution must really be carried through now
Europe must not hesitate to deploy all its diplomatic and economic resources to achieve this
We pride ourselves on our capacity for conflict prevention and humanitarian aid , and rightly so
We operate with a broad security concept , and rightly so , and realise that prevention is much better
Time after time , Europe has emphasised the importance of the multilateral approach via the Security Council
Con@@ fron@@ ted with incessant statements about a war that is all but unavoidable , it is of great importance that the Council and the Commission side with Parliament
Ma@@ x@@ imum pressure should , of course , be brought to bear on Saddam via the Security Council , but we must also make every effort to prevent war
Nor , would I say , is it divided in the United States where , as we know , two-thirds of the people oppose this war
We are talking about a war which is both pointless and destructive , as members from all sides of this House have pointed out
However , the main brunt of any military attack will be borne by the Iraqi people themselves , who have been suffering under the economic embargo for years now
The twel@@ ve@@ -year embargo has itself operated as a weapon of mass de@@ struc@@ tion; it has cost the lives of one million people , half of whom were children
Anyone in any doubt need only visit the hospitals in Iraq , where children are dying of malnutrition and a lack of rudimentary medical care
I have seen them with my own eyes
I am positive that the Greek Presidency will meet the challenges and play its historic part
Mr President , I should like to welcome the Greek prime minister and wish him every success
We all know that Greece is a relatively small country
No one expects any miracles
But they do expect the right approach
This is not the first Greek Presiden@@ cy@@ ; there have been two previous presidencies , both of which left themselves open to a great deal of criticism
As the chairman of the Greens quite rightly said , you cannot hide behind the Security Council
With four members in the Security Council , the European Union should be fighting to block a war
I listened very closely to the prime minister 's speech and I should like to comment on three points which worry me
First , the fact that the prime minister said that this is a joint annual programme of the Greek and Italian presidencies
I expect him to refer to this at greater length in his next speech
And the third point has to do with social issues
Mr Prime Minister , I am waiting for Greece to apply Directive 70/@@ 1999 on fixed-term work
It should have started applying this directive on 10 July 2002 but has yet to do so
Please do not put Mrs Diamantopoulou in the un@@ enviable position of having to institute proceedings against Greece before the European Court
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I would like to raise two points which , I would say , concern me , in your statements
The first , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , is that you have not really developed your project on maritime safety
Would it impose the designation of ports of refuge ?
I shall stop the list there , Mr President
The second subject that concerns me is the Spring Summit
The summit you are preparing for is nothing unusual , and yet there is urgency
will the Union continue to provide financial aid to multinational companies with nothing in return , without ensuring sustainable employment for employees ?
This is the opposite of sustainable development
This leads me to put two questions , the first of which has to do with how this defence policy is to develop in future
That would be an expression of confidence when we take joint action
Do you share the view that a common market in defence needs to be created ?
I might add that this threat is not justified under the UN Charter
You can count on the support of the Group of the Party of European Socialists in this House
Mr President , in wishing the Greek Presidency well , I appeal to it to make every effort to address the grave problem of falling farm incomes
I make this appeal as someone who has spent his whole life in agriculture and rural development in one way or another
We have here in Europe a unique model of family farming which , with falling incomes , is now under serious threat
The reluctance of young people to take up farming as a career is evidence of the problem within agriculture
The five priorities that you have enumerated and set yourself are , politically speaking , not merely a matter of logic but also of necessity
My second question has to do with enlargement , and , in particular , with your strategy in relation to Turkey
This is a considerable obstacle to surmount , and it is at present far from clear that Turkey will be able to meet these conditions
The question I have in this context relates to Greek strategy towards Turkey
There is a third point , and this is something to which I would like to give favourable mention
Your declaration of belief , in the chapter on energy policy , in the establishment of common rules on nuclear safety is something that I very much welcome
Do you think this has a real chance of being more widely accepted in the Council ?
Even today , there are manifestations of crisis , and there has been a recent recurrence of gun@@ fights in Sand@@ z@@ ak
We know that neither the situation in Yugoslavia - now Serbia and Montenegro - nor that in Kosovo have really been resolved to the satisfaction of all parties
We must be guided by the need for adaptation of the mechanisms for encouragement and support
The next , post-@@ 2004 , Commission will have to give consideration to how to allocate responsibilities for the Balkans within itself
If , though , unmis@@ take@@ able signals go out from Sal@@ on@@ iki , even the Commission will be able to adapt itself as necessary
There is also a need for annual progress reports
Let the signal you send out be a bold one , one that is readily understood , and one that also awak@@ ens a sense of responsibility in these countries
I certainly support what the chairman of my group has said
Before coming here , I asked the Greek Presidency if it would give priority to the issue of international maritime traffic in dangerous goods
I subsequently noted that the President-in-Office of the Council did in fact refer to this question
Maritime traffic is an important issue for Greece and it is to be expected that the Greek Prime Minister should give it priority
Mr President-in-Office , like those I have quoted many of the names are Greek and most of the shipowners were or are Greek
The sea is now ruled by illegal and lawless mafias
The Member States have neither implemented the ' Erika ' legislation nor set up the compensation fund
What does the Greek Presidency intend to do along these lines ?
I believe it should distinguish itself by taking action in this area
On the contrary , growth is very weak and the political will is lacking
do you intend to apply policies that will help achieve the Lisbon objectives in all the Member States of the European Union , especially Greece ?
What is certain is that the post-war world order and its institutions will be the victims of the conflict and a different world will emerge from it
The European Union needs to have a view and an opinion about this new world
Only with this priority will a presidency be successful and worthy of the times we live in
Sittings come and go
However , the times we live in call for a return to the values of the people of Europe , as is only proper when we are fighting for peace
Mr President , Mr Prime Minister , Mr President of the Commission , I have listened very carefully to the priorities you set out
I wish there were six instead of five , but I think that the sixth will be added in due course
I refer to the mid-term review of the common agricultural policy
The final proposals are due before the end of January
The European Union is already taking on ten new members
The rural population of the European Union will rise by 1@@ 65 % and rural land by 43 %
C@@ ul@@ tiv@@ able land will increase by 55 %
And yet the budget up to 2013 , in the best case scenario - with minimum inflation - will remain the same
I was both interested and delighted to see that entrepreneurship and small enterprises are one of your priorities
Today you announced this in an ambitious voice
We shall be here in about five months ' time , to@@ tting up the accounts to see what has been done
I noted that you intend to continue the enhanced pre-accession strategy with Bulgaria and Romania , Mr President-in-Office , and rightly so
But we must not forget the southern Balkans , where rapprochement with the European Union started up some time ago under the stability and association process
On the Lisbon strategy , I should like to focus on sustainable development
The need to promote a sustainable development strategy within the framework of European integration is even more urgent today , what with the pressure of enlargement and increasing globalisation
That is why I think it is so important for us to adopt a step-by-step procedure for monitoring policy in practice at the spring European Council
The difficulties in getting the Kyoto protocol signed make it even more imperative that we step up dialogue and collaboration with the USA , Japan and developing countries
Obviously , the European Union cannot deal with this as an internal problem
So it needs to shoulder its responsibilities at international level , which means pioneering efforts to achieve sustainable development through technology and science
As far as defence and immigration policy are concerned , I agree
As you know , we have been calling for an immigration policy in the European Union for years , without any concrete results
We expect an integrated policy to be developed and an integrated policy on illegal immigration to be developed
I think the Thessaloniki Council needs to push on with the reform of the Treaties of the European Union
Finally , in foreign relations , I think that you need to encourage Euro-Mediterranean cooperation , basically under a long-term Euro-Mediterranean policy
Italy is to follow Greece , giving two countries with excellent knowledge of these problems the chance to draw up an efficient Euro-Mediterranean policy
Cooperation is not enough
We need a long-term policy
I wish you every success
May I wish you every success
We are on the brink of the biggest enlargement in the history of the Union , an enlargement which puts an end to a division which has lasted fifty years
The Convention has called for more Europe on numerous occasions and the Greek Presidency will put the finishing touches to this structure in Thessaloniki in June
Europe is also in the middle of a very serious downturn in the economy
The global economy is in recession , but that is nothing new
The economic de@@ pression in Europe has lasted at least ten years
Europe has resisted an inspired strategy , the Lisbon strategy
And now this strategy is also in danger of being washed away by the recession
These creative prospects cannot be reversed
We are not going to cancel enlargement and we are not going to stop drafting a European constitution
Their beneficial results , however , may be delayed if we have to deal with war with Iraq
I agree with my honourable friend Mr Poettering that nuclear weapons cannot be left in irresponsible hands
But nor can they be left in responsible hands , Mr Poettering
There are no hands responsible enough for these terrifying , apo@@ c@@ aly@@ ptic weapons we have armed ourselves with
We do not know what is going to happen in Iraq
He managed to avert that war
I trust the experience he gained will help him do as much for the war which is threatening the entire planet as we speak
Mr President , I am grateful to have the opportunity to respond at the end of the debate
Members have raised very interesting points
I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will have taken careful note and will be keen to take on board as many of them as he can
On behalf of the Liberal Group I welcome this closer working relationship between Parliament and the Council
We see it very publicly , particularly in the Convention , and also in the number of very successful negotiations through the codecision process
Mr President , unfortunately , circumstances prevent me from being in celebr@@ atory mood
It will step up the attack on employment , insurance and pension rights
It will wipe out even more small and medium-sized farms during the mid-term review of the CAP
It will promote mechanisms for de@@ porting immigrants and strict asylum laws
Using terrorism as a pretext , it will promote the transposition of anti-grass roots European legislation into national law and the abolition of democratic rights and freedoms
That is why the people of Europe who , unlike big business , have nothing good to expect from the Greek Presidency , should not be complacent
The only way out is for them to join forces and step up their fight against this policy
In Greece , demonstrations are almost a daily occurrence
They will culminate with demonstrations in June , which we invite the workers of Europe to attend
As far as the Communist Party of Greece is concerned , it will be right on the front line of this fight
Mr President , I wanted to pick up on a couple of the points raised by Mr Prodi and by the Greek Presidency
Firstly , on the research and development policy of the European Union , Mr Prodi talked about the need to develop and invest in clean technologies
Obviously our group agrees with this
I note that the Greek Presidency has identified cutting-edge technologies , in biotechnology and defence , as research priorities
That begs a few questions about how we are deciding what we wish to invest in , with whom we are wishing to compete , and for what purpose
I am interested in understanding how this links to the current treaty requirement in Article 6 to integrate the environment into policies and practices of the European Union
Mr Trakatellis made some very important points on this
We are pleased that in future we are going to be monitoring policies in terms of a social sustainable development emphasis
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Greece has changed a great deal since its last presidency , as it has become a staunch supporter of Turkey 's candidacy
Greece 's position with regard to the institutions surprised us a little
On studying this statement carefully , we learn that , according to the Greek Government , the Commission should possess greater decision-making power than even the Council
That is indeed far removed from an intergovernmental Union , but it is also far removed from the traditional Community model
I hope that the Prime Minister will contradict me later on
We would therefore ask the Presidency to show greater firmness in these matters , and in particular in the fight against illegal immigration
This summary would have been fully justified , since Greece has presided over the Eurogroup for the past six months
there is no such summary
With regard to the past , how has the euro favoured growth , or , on the contrary , has it had an adverse effect ?
With regard to the future , how , for example , does the Greek Presidency intend to contribute to making the Stability Pact more intelligent ?
We would have benefited from some clarification on all of these points
Mr President , allow me to start by thanking all the members of the European Parliament
Their interventions will help the presidency enormously in outlining its policy and taking decisive action
This has been a most useful debate
Mr President , after Prime Minister Sim@@ itis ' exhaustive reply , I wish only to add a brief comment and response in order not to prolong your suffering
The first question concerns the proposal to create a worldwide Socrates programme
I believe that this is the way to go
We have already created an Erasmus World based on the same criteria , save that the financing is such as to restrict us to minor projects
We , with our costs , with our social structure , with our diversities - if we do not take a great leap forward we will be lost
I will give you just one example , by way of a practical illustration
At present , it costs three times as much to transport a container from China to Amsterdam as it does to transport a container from Amsterdam to China
Such are the market forces on both sides
I can give you another figure
In the past month , there have been 8 million new subscri@@ bers to mobile telephone networks in China - in one month
We are deluding ourselves
My response to the second question is this
We have been accused of not mentioning the benefits of the internal markets
these are the basis of all the measures we will take this year
Su@@ ffice it to say that our future depends on the competition the internal market can bring
That concludes the item
The next item is Questions to the Commission
The Commission has just informed us that , due to unforeseen circumstances , Mr Vitorino cannot attend Question Time
He will be replaced by Mrs de Palacio , who will reply to Question No 18 by Mr Papayannakis
Mr Posselt has the floor for a point of order
Mr President , I realise that this is rather out of the ordinary , but might I not be permitted to take over Mr L@@ age 's question ?
I wanted to put a supplementary question in any case
Supplementary questions must be just that; supplementary questions
The protracted war in Angola has brought about a severe crisis and a calam@@ itous economic and social situation
Thousands of people , children included , are dying of hunger
The Lu@@ anda Government has been appealing again and again for emergency aid
Given the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Angola , international aid , not least from the European Union , has to be stepped up immediately
Is the Commission monitoring developments as regards hunger in Angola , which , according to the most recent figures , is now bese@@ tting four million people ?
What steps is it taking to minimise the immense human suffering ?
Mr President , the Commission is committed to addressing the dramatic humanitarian crisis in Angola effectively and without delay and to supporting the peace process
The Commission is constantly monitoring the situation in Angola , as we have done for many years , in order to get a clear picture of humanitarian needs
On that occasion I will be signing the EC-@@ Angola cooperation strategy for 2002-@@ 2007 , including the plan of action
emergency humanitarian aid and a longer-term strategy based on cooperation
This is funded by ECHO and by EDF funds
Last year Angola was among the top ten recipients of ECHO funding , receiving a total of EUR 14 million
This year , an initial decision has been taken to provide EUR 8 million funding , due to be adopted soon
Mal@@ nutrition is one of the main targets for our support in the humanitarian area , particularly in forgotten regions where no other donors are present in the country
These funds are targeted at medical assistance , the distribution of seeds and tools , food aid and the resettlement of former UNITA soldiers and their families
D@@ e-@@ mining is also important
We tried to do all this as quickly as possible last year
The decision on all this will be implemented through different UN agencies , Eur@@ on@@ Aid and FAO for the food security component and different NGOs for the de-mining operations
Proposals for EUR 16 million have been signed and the remaining proposals are awaiting approval by the Angolan national authorities
They are expected to be finalised within the next few weeks
We are therefore calling upon the government of Angola to make more efforts in addressing the critical humanitarian needs of the population
These are times of great change and challenge for Angola after many years of conflict
The emphasis now will be on progress , economic growth , stability and governance
That will change the whole mood of politics in the country and I am looking forward to the dialogue we shall be participating in next week
I totally agree that the best solution for Angola is to take advantage of this country 's enormous potential
Angola has been generously endowed with resources by nature , but unfortunately it has also been the victim of acts of madness by mankind for decade upon decade
Thank you very much , Commissioner , I think that the Commission should continue along the lines you have just informed us about
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to add something to what has just been said
There are three questions I would like to put to you
Firstly , what actual agricultural programmes is the Commission implementing ?
That , in my view , is the most important thing , that the country can again be self-supporting and export agricultural produce
Secondly , what is the state of the infrastructure that is needed to distribute the food ?
And thirdly , what is happening about educational and training programmes ?
These are , I believe , the three most important issues that are at stake here
In cases like this almost everything is important
I would say to Mr Posselt that consolidating peace , to give people the confidence that it is irreversible , is most important right now
This is extremely high on the agenda
For humanitarian reasons , for political reasons and for economic reasons , opening up and creating a normal flow is absolutely essential
There is an increasing number of accidents due to landmines because things are starting to move now
It is therefore enormously urgent to accelerate that effort
As regards agriculture , as defined in the country strategy paper , we will be focusing on agricultural development
This is essential both for the survival of the people and because of the enormous potential that Mr Posselt rightly pointed to
Angola is more than diamonds and oil
It is also a country that has great potential for a much more diversified economy
As the author is not present , Question No 16 lapses
I would apologise to the Commissioner on behalf of this Parliament
Mr President , on 3 December , the Commission approved a communication on the measures to be taken as a result of the accident involving the oil tanker Prestige
The Transport Council of 6 December supported the majority of the initiatives proposed by the Commission
The European Union has not waited for the recent events to happen to implement an agreed maritime safety policy
There was already a wide range of measures for guaranteeing better protection in this field
In relation to the Prestige , responsibility and liability were disputed
This delayed action and the absence of a coordinated EU response aggravated the environmental impact
On top of this , we have had the subsequent incidents involving the T@@ ric@@ ol@@ or , the K@@ ari@@ ba and the Nic@@ ola
All these indicate the need not just for legislation but for the resources to do the job
Would the Commission consider setting up a study ?
They have successful experience in this field , and we have a lot to learn from them
This is what I said very clearly when I made the proposals in the Erika I and Erika II packages
I do fully agree that there are things we can learn from the United States
In the end , as the honourable Members know , a less ambitious timetable was approved
We must coordinate the European response
I do indeed have the document of 3 December , which I read with great interest
Furthermore , will Galicia be considered as a location for a European Maritime Safety Agency ?
Mr Nogueira , firstly , in relation to your last comments , I do not see that conflict between the positions of the Commission and of the Council
I would therefore insist that I believe there is considerable agreement
The Prestige tragedy has been a real wake-up call for all the Member States of the Union
This will be decided by the European Council at the appropriate time
I should like to thank Mr Cushnahan for raising this issue in the House today
Is it not time to ban all flag@@ -of-@@ convenience ships once and for all , not just from EU ports but from EU waters as well ?
You are also well aware of the problem associated with maritime traffic
With regard to flags of convenience , the honourable Members are aware that , within the International Maritime Organisation , work is being done to improve this situation
We must distinguish between these two situations
We have to make their lives difficult in our ports so that they stop coming
This type of action and control , particularly in relation to those countries and flags which present most risk , is the way to act in the immediate term
We must analyse these chains and deal with the issues in depth , and we must also deal with responsibility in the event of serious negligence
In accordance with the former , the Commission can bring a case before the Court of Justice if the alleged act falls within the scope of Community law
The majority of cases relating to the issues raised by the honourable Member relate to asylum , immigration and the protection of the rights of third-country nationals
These issues are included in the scope of the Community 's competences
Furthermore , the Community began to legislate on this issue in accordance with Articles 61 and 63 of the European Community Treaty
In any event , the Commission will closely monitor the development of the dialogue between the Council of Europe and the Greek authorities
I really do hope that you will keep an eye on this
It is a very , very serious matter
It raises questions of transparency and questions of control because , as you can see , the committee of the Council of Europe has been given false information
I hope that neither you nor the European Commission will be given false information
Form@@ al adoption is yet to take place because of the parliamentary reservations of one State of the Union
Furthermore , they will ensure that the conditions for reception are subject to appropriate monitoring and control
Finally , they will have to ensure the prevention of violence in places intended to house asylum seekers , at borders and in residential centres
Mr President , I think Mr Papayannakis was also raising the issue of control
In one Member State , Italy , Members of Parliament are able to visit prisons and similar institutions day and night , without advance warning
Is the Commission prepared to table a proposal for European parliamentarians to be able to visit prisons and this type of institution throughout the Union 's territory ?
This is a subject which I know he is very capable to deal with , since I have participated in a number of seminars organised by his services
I have two points to make to the President
Firstly , I have discussed this with Mr
Perhaps you could address that , and take it up with the services , so that in future we may be given more knowledge about these instances
Can I ask you , if we have time , to allow Mr Liikanen to answer my question ?
Com@@ pe@@ tence for and allocation of the order or classification of these questions falls to the Commission , which naturally can make mistakes , just as Parliament can
In the classification today , as you have explained quite rightly , this question is not allocated to Mr Liikanen
In other words , introducing one question means giving up another , and this sets a very difficult precedent
You , as a Brit@@ on , know better than anybody else how important precedents are
In principle , your question will be replied to in writing
It will only be possible if some of the twenty minutes remains and Mr Liikanen is prepared to answer it
In any event , Mr Liikanen can give his opinion
Since you have referred to the opinion of Mr Liikanen , I will give him the floor so that he can give his opinion on this point or order
I can then reply in that context
If it comes within the twenty minutes , without setting a precedent - and I have heard Mr Liikanen - I will allow a brief reply
Otherwise , it will not be possible and you will receive a reply in writing
As the author is not present , Question No 19 lapses
Has the Commission drawn up such a document and , if so , what are the main new strategies for promoting the entrepreneurial activities of SMEs ?
Has it already evaluated the participation of SMEs in existing Community support programmes for SMEs ?
The Commission is committed to improving the environment for small businesses
This is a policy line that we have followed for many years
The European Charter for Small Enterprises has been a valuable instrument focusing and reinforcing this work
Many of the Charter recommendations address issues that fall under national responsibility
Much of the Commission 's work aims to help Member States to improve the business environment for their small businesses
The Commission welcomes the request of the Barcelona European Council that Member States speed up the Charter implementation
This has contributed to keeping small businesses ' concerns high on the political agenda
Better regulation is at the heart of the Commission 's concerns at the moment
A detailed review of all Community measures benefiting small and medium-sized enterprises will also be published next week when the Commission reports comprehensively on entrepreneurial and SME activities
At the same time I hope we will be also able to adopt in the Commission the Green Paper on Entreprene@@ urship
how to produce more entrepreneurs ,
how to get more firms to grow
The Green Paper defines entrepreneurship as a ' mindset ' and focuses on the role of policy on entrepreneurial behaviour among both new and existing entrepreneurs
It also considers the influence of society at large on entrepreneurial initiative and risk-@@ taking
The Paper suggests a coordinated approach , involving policy-makers in different services at European , national and regional level , to provide a coherent response to the needs of entrepreneurs
The Commission can help the Member States to share experience and compare performance
firstly , bringing down barriers to business development and grow@@ th@@ ;
secondly , balancing the risks and reward of entreprene@@ ur@@ ship@@ ;
and thirdly , a society that values entrepreneurship
For each of these , the Green Paper raises a number of questions for debate
The European Commission is currently working on a new approach to the CE marking system and the future strategy for that system
From the point of view of European SM@@ U@@ s , it is particularly important that European third-party certi@@ fi@@ ers should continue to be able to place their own marks on all products
How does the European Commission intend to incorporate these considerations regarding the strengthening of the position of European certification undertakings into its new approach to the CE marking system ?
CE conformity is one of the main points that have been identified as requiring strengthening
The communication will also address the issue of the relationship between the CE marking and voluntary markings
The Commission has conducted an on-line survey of new approach stakeholders
They also often provide added value for consumers , users , public authorities and all those being addressed
Third party certi@@ fi@@ ers are in some sectors already involved in the conformity assessment procedures leading to the CE marking
It is also quite often stipulated that the identification number of the item should appear next to the CE marking
The CE conformity marking does indeed confirm that the product complies with all rules within the European Union and is legal here
I believe that such upward gra@@ dation of quality would be of great importance to consumers and the public
I thank Mr Rübig for his interest on this issue of conformity assessment
Con@@ formity assessment new approach directives are not usually included among the major policy issues which reach the front page
On the other hand , they also enable the proper weight to be given to the interests of the consumer
I hope Parliament will create a system to deal properly with the communication which is coming in fairly soon
First of all , I should like to refer to the reply that the President will give today
For the first time the Commission has made a proposal that has undergone this broadened impact assessment , concerning employment policy guidelines
It is very important for our internal work that we stick to this impact assessment system
I hope that Parliament will take advantage of this too
When dealing with legislation Parliament will be able properly to assess the Commission proposal
The next challenge is how Parliament and the Council will assess the changes they might make to the Commission proposal
That is the issue for Parliament , the Council and the Commission in forthcoming discussions
Ref@@ erring to the President 's reply , we will have opportunities to discuss the matter further
Mr Rübig , in any event you will receive a reply in writing as Question No 52
I can dispense with a description of the dire economic situation in Kosov@@ a , well known as it is
Kosov@@ a needs urgently to be enabled to pursue an imaginative policy in order to attract investment
The big problem is that the Kosov@@ an authorities are prevented by the statute in force from pursuing any such policy
Kosov@@ a is , in particular , not at present in a position to conclude any international trade agreements or to contract loans with international financial institutions
Kosov@@ a needs a clearly autonomous statute
I therefore ask the Commission what future prospects it can hold out to the Kosovars of that happening
Specifically , can Kosov@@ an institutions count on very wide-ranging autonomy in the future ?
Kosovo 's current economic situation is clearly a product of past political and economic neglect and oppression before 1999
This demanded major economic efforts from the United Nations interim administration , and especially its European Union pillar , in the last three years
A war-torn region has been economically stabilised , basic infrastructure has been repaired , the euro has been introduced and the legal framework for a market economy is being laid
A new customs service is collecting much-needed revenues for the Kosovo budget
There is still a long way to go but we should not forget from which level we started
UNMIK is also currently consulting with various international financial organisations on how to give Kosovo access to their funds in the absence of a decision on its final status
In short , we have gone a very long way to find creative ways to improve Kosovo 's economic situation and we will continue to do so
I would like to thank Commissioner Patten wholeheartedly for his answer
It was a very elaborate answer which took account of reality
They are asking us to make serious efforts to enable them to contact international financial institutions despite their current status
The war took place almost three and a half years ago
This is a question from the people on the spot
First of all I am glad that technology eventually brought us the honourable Member 's supplementary question
I have two points
The status issue has raised some problems in that respect
Kosovo 's status is currently defined under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 of 10 June 1999
Any decision on its final status will therefore have to be taken by the Security Council
The international community has not set a clear point in time at which this issue will be debated
Consequently it is not up to the Commission to draw up scenarios for Kosovo 's future status
UNMI@@ C has set clear benchmarks concerning democratic and market economic reforms , human and minority rights , which are all necessary to prepare Kosovo for future challenges
These basic standards must be met before a discussion on status can begin
Kosovo is an integral part of the region for which we have devised the stabilisation and association process to bring it closer to European Union structures
We have made sure that Kosovo 's unresolved status does not prevent it from benefiting from the stabilisation and association process
If people cannot see what prospects there are for the country , they will carry on trying to emigrate , rather than investing their energies in Kosovo itself
is there any sort of dialogue between the European Union and the representatives of Kosovo , in which these issues are at least considered ?
Clearly we have discussed those political issues with Kosovar representatives
Mr President , Commissioner , I think that you are right to refer to the arguments of the honourable Member who is talking about standards before status
That is an ' ei@@ ther@@ /or ' approach
Should we not , however , be aiming for a ' bo@@ th@@ /@@ and ' approach ?
Should we not be working on standards - and I share your opinion entirely - and the status of Kosovo at the same time ?
I think that a ' bo@@ th@@ /@@ and ' approach is a better one , one which offers the Kosovar people more hope and more opportunities
I would not suggest that , but I think it would be better for Kosovo at the moment if efforts were to be focused on the question of standards
This does not mean that we are going to be able to put off indefinitely a discussion on the terms of the UN Security Council resolution
'@@ First things first ' is not a bad piece of advice to give to the people of Kosovo at the moment
Israeli military operations and lost EU funding
The EU has financed many projects in the state of Palestine , in particular to help develop democracy and secure human rights
The list of destroyed projects has recently been updated by the Commission office in Jerusalem , in coordination with the EU Member State representative offices in Jerusalem and Ramallah
The estimated total , as of 14 December last year , stands at approximately EUR 24 million
This assessment is limited to the costs of physical infrastructure , excluding indirect losses such as project delays or suspen@@ sions
The issue was also more recently discussed at the EU-Israel Association Council meeting of 21 October 2002
The position of the European Union in the international community is that the want@@ on destruction of basic infrastructure and facilities is counter-productive
It sets back efforts to improve the economic , social and humanitarian development in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
Poverty levels are now at over 60 % and unemployment is at around 50 %
This situation of economic collapse , and a deepening humanitarian crisis , destroys hope and destroys any prospect of stability and security for both Israel and the Palestinians
Israel , due to its relatively high average income per inhabitant , is not eligible to benefit from bilateral European Union funding under MEDA programmes
So the Israeli Government or Israeli public entities do not receive funding from the European Union aid budget
Some organisations from civil society in Israel and the Palestinian territories may apply for projects designed to support the peace process
These projects should , in our view , be pursued in any circumstances
Some organisations have advocated - and this has been debated in Parliament - commercial sanctions against Israel
Mr President , I should like to thank Commissioner Patten for a very precise and very satisfactory answer
Has it any influence , or is the EU trying to maintain the aid it is at present able to give to the development of Palestinian society ?
I should like to make two points
Firstly , all of us condemn terrorist acts
All of us condemn suicide bombing
I am not sure what damaging and almost destroying the Central Bureau of Statistics in the Palestinian territories has to do with roo@@ ting out terrorism
I am not sure what destroying the Land Registry has to do with roo@@ ting out terrorism
We have been one of the main supporters of the Palestinian authority and have been the subject of some very unfair criticism for that
However , keeping a Palestinian authority in being is an important part of holding out the prospect of a peace process
We continue to provide substantial quantities of other sorts of assistance , such as humanitarian assistance
Before Christmas we announced that we would provide EUR 30 million for those municipalities in Palestine that had been hardest hit by hostilities
We are providing a loan fund of EUR 10 million for small - and medium-sized enterprises
I can send details of all the assistance that we have given in the Palestinian authorities
I am only sorry that it has not been more successful in creating the economic and social foundations that are so relevant to a peaceful political future
Mr President , I would be interested to know if the Commission has considered the accusations from the Israeli point of view
I would be interested to know what conclusions this has led the Commission to draw
I will take two examples that I referred to earlier
How can doing a huge amount of damage to the Central Bureau of Statistics in the Palestinian territory be other than an example of needless destruction ?
It is not very sensible when most of the material contained in the Central Bureau of Statistics can be found freely on the internet
It is difficult to see how those activities can be justified
In this context it would be possible for an applicant to present a project concerning a ' Vo@@ ice of Europe '
However , this brings me to the problem of cost
Achieving the same objectives by the use of the Internet might be a more appropriate way forward
Commissioner , thank you for that response , which opens up a number of prospects
I plan to read the written version with great care when it reaches me
Thirty million is starting to look more feasible in relation to the 100 million that make up the annual budget devoted to human rights
I should like first of all to emphasise my personal interest in this subject
I understand , however , the point made by the Member
Radio Free Asia has a budget of about EUR 30 million per year
If we were to take that as the model , we would be talking about committing 30 per cent of the budget for Chapter B7-@@ 7
I suspect that the House would regard that as rather a large ch@@ unk of the available funds
I suspect that , if this were so , I would have to argue with the Court of Auditors and with Parliament
The policy on democracy and human rights that we now faithfully follow precisely reflects reports by Parliament and the Court of Auditors
It was warmly endorsed for its strategic thrust by both the Council and by the Parliament
The Member concerned has powerful powers of persuasion
His silver tongue might be able to convince Parliament to support this proposition and to change its view on strategic thrust
Do you believe that Euro-@@ News might be a means of disseminating European values and discussions throughout the world ?
Nobody should be immune from that sort of scrutiny where taxpayers ' money is involved
When I look back , I might well wish that European broadcasters had done more at an earlier stage to provide greater competition with CNN
As the time allotted to questions to the Commission has elapsed , Questions Nos 26 to 58 will be replied to in writing
C@@ lear@@ ing and settlement , essential components of all securities transactions , are therefore fundamental to the smooth functioning of integrated financial markets
The European model with as many as 20 CS@@ Ds is frag@@ mentary , benefiting from the fact that competition is only limited to securing new areas of influence
There has never been a price war , as market liquidity is controlled by a single active player
Remo@@ val of the technical barriers has to be our prime objective and can be considered easily attainable
Stand@@ ardis@@ ing information technology languages and paper@@ -based documentation does not , in fact , require a particular operational effort
There would certainly be greater difficulties in harmonising legal and taxation rules
Therefore , the creation of this code must be considered a long-term objective
In the short term , an information statement should be drawn up which would provide market participants with a guide to the differences between the laws in the Member States
With regard to taxation barriers , the difficulties do not stem only from the differences between systems but also from strong resistance to change and harmonisation by some Member States
This option would guarantee market integrity , ease of access to the service by users and effective supervision with regard to operational risks
There could not be any distortions of competition , because this guarantee stems from the fact that the services user participates in managing the body
Innovation and technical progress could also be attained since the arrangement in paragraph 11 of the report specifies that non-profit status comes after allowing for necessary investment needs
Se@@ par@@ ation of core services and value-added services is considered vital
The clearing and settlement service encompasses guarantee , margin@@ ing , clearing , settlement and regulation activities
A quick read through reveals that these are all public utility services
In conclusion , it is also vital to have strong cooperation between the States in order to ensure adequate supervision
The Commission welcomes the European Parliament 's timely and constructive response to its communication on clearing and settlement
In particular I should like to thank the rapporteur for his important report
The Commission will assess Parliament 's response to its communication very carefully and will take into account the views expressed in that report
The Commission shares the view expressed in the resolution that efficient clearing and settlement is vital for the proper and safe functioning of the European financial markets
In fact , as is often said with reason , clearing and settlement is the plum@@ bing system of the securities markets , without which nothing works
That is essential for our common goal to build an integrated EU capital market by 2005
The Commission feels that we should encourage market-@@ led approaches and solutions wherever possible
All these concerns need to be taken into account , and the rapporteur referred to a number of them
The Commission now intends to issue a new communication which will set out clear policy orientations , something which , until now , we have not been able to do
That document will serve as a basis for a second round of consultation , possibly in the first half of this year
I look forward to having a further discussion with Parliament , hopefully with the same rapporteur , on that subject
Mr President , like Mr Bolkestein I would like to thank Mr An@@ dri@@ a for his hard work on this most important of subjects
I agree with the Commissioner and the rapporteur that it is very important to remove technical and other barriers to cross-border clearing and settlement in Europe
The Commission and the European Union can play a constructive role in facilitating cross-border clearing and settlement as a vital part of creating a single market in financial services
There are certain points upon which PPE-DE Group opinion is divided , in particular point 11
It is not necessary to separate so-called core and value-added services , contrary to the view of the rapporteur
It is vital to price these different services transparently , so that when people are purchasing they know exactly which service they are buying and which they are not
I myself and many in the group therefore support a small amendment to Mr An@@ dri@@ a 's report on that point
I have reservations about the proposal that we should move to a directive at this point
We might well need to look at a directive in the future but it may be premature to decide now whether a directive is necessary
There are great merits in opting for us@@ er-@@ owned systems
We certainly should not write in at this stage the requirement that these services must be managed on a ' not for profit ' basis
It is important to allow firms to innovate and to invest , and a certain amount of profit generation is necessary to allow that investment
I welcome much of Mr An@@ dri@@ a 's report , with those three minor reservations
In particular we should not prejudge the market at this stage
Mr President , first of all , I would like to thank Mr An@@ dri@@ a for his work , on behalf of my group
This is a complex subject and Mr An@@ dri@@ a used all the means available to him to reach a compromise
Our group is highly satisfied with his working methods and the results he has achieved
The report , as voted on in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs , is very well-balanced
We would like to add two minor amendments designed to clarify the text rather than change the content
I shall not repeat the importance of our work in establishing an integrated financial market at European level
Parliament has already examined some aspects of this market and imposed some of the extremely numerous common rules which will be necessary for it to function properly
A single , transparent framework for clearing and settlement is part of these essential rules
That is why , in parallel with our work on the directive on investment services , Parliament is asking the Commission for a draft directive on clearing and settlement
In the absence of any form of regulation , the market players have organised themselves to create a system which , although it does function , is far from ideal
Furthermore , this system naturally tends towards the establishment of a private monopoly and distortions of competition due to confusion between the differing functions of infrastructures and banks
We could , of course , as some Members are proposing , allow the market to organise itself
We could also shoulder our responsibilities as co-legislators and ask the Commission to lay down rules ensuring transparency and free competition
Everyone here knows that the markets cannot achieve a healthy balance unless they are organised transparently and safely
That is not currently the case , and that is what my group is asking for
We support the rapporteur on three essential points
First , the removal of all barriers to the creation of a single market for clearing and settlement
These barriers , whether technical , fiscal or legal , obstruct the fin@@ alisation of individual cross-border transactions and must be removed
We call for open , fair access to settlement infrastructures
We believe these settlement infrastructures should be considered as a service of general interest
That should not prejudice their private or public status , but allow them to be run as non-profit-making bodies and be accessible without discrimination to all users
Lastly , we must put an end to the current state of confusion between commercial and non-commercial functions
We cannot accept that some players , driven solely by the prospect of profit , expose the non-commercial functions to the risks inherent in banking
This seems particularly relevant at a time when the United States are stepping up measures to protect their market
That is why our group will support Mr An@@ dri@@ a 's request for clear separation of roles
That way we will protect our markets and put an end to the dumping that is often concealed in the confusion
The European Commission has asked us to speak on this matter
If we are to fulfil our role as co@@ legislator , it is not enough to present the Commission with a recommendation that is devoid of any content
For this reason , our group will reject all the amendments that are nothing more than delaying tactics and will support the rapporteur in his clear , constructive positions
We have also taken the liberty of adding to the compromise adopted by all the groups on paragraph 12 our concern for transparency and the exercise of free competition
I do not think that should pose a problem to my fellow Members
Mr President , I would like to congratulate Mr An@@ dri@@ a on his excellent work , first of all , and secondly on his political courage in this difficult matter
Post-@@ market infrastructures do indeed play a fundamental part in the proper conclusion of transactions
You spoke of trust and security
System@@ ic risks are also inherent in this type of activity which therefore clearly fall within the scope of general interest
On the other hand , these activities have an increasing return
It is for these two reasons that , based on experience , a public interest regulation is vital
We know , however , that these regulations exist at national level , as well as at European level , and fragmented infrastructures and rules pre@@ dominated until recently
That is why it is time to establish a legislative act in accordance with our objective of building the internal market
Hence the proposals to separate non-profit-making activities from fee systems based on costs
In conclusion , I shall say that now is the time to legislate
We have clear positions from the rapporteur which Parliament should adopt without sug@@ aring the pill in order to achieve a positive line
We believe that the Commission should now , for the sake of the credibility of all our work , prepare the draft directive
It has recently become clear in Europe and in the USA how sensi@@ tively financial markets react to various developments
Stability in the financial markets is continuously under fire , with all the repercussions that this has on consumer confidence in the economy
Stability in the financial markets can be aided by effective management based on clear regulation
Mr An@@ dri@@ a 's report on promoting the efficient settlement of securities therefore requires our full attention
Given the complexity of the way securities are organised , there is no simple solution
I would , however , like to emphasise that a solution must be transparent and controllable
That is in the interests of confidence in the financial markets
An inquiry into competition aspects as described in paragraph 15 can contribute to creating a transparent securities market
I believe that we can look back on the way in which this Parliament worked to eliminate obstacles to cross-border payments last year
At that time too , all the organisations , rules and interests formed a complex whole
Yet it turned out to be possible to eliminate virtually insurmountable obstacles
It is therefore high time we made sure that where there is an internal securities market , the numerous settlement costs do not obstruct cross-border transactions in this market
Mr President , Commissioner , clearing and settlement are an essential element in all securities market transactions
The Commission communication on clearing and settlement in the European Union analyses the sources of inefficiency in cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements
This inefficiency is largely due to technical requirements , market practice and the fragmentation resulting from national differences and legal barriers
It is also very important that the supervisory authorities adhere to a common approach and harmonised rules
Firstly , the technical barriers should be broken down and there should be a move towards interoperability of systems
The solution chosen in drafting an EU securities code would not necessarily represent Europe 's single financial markets but the application of a national solution on a European scale
This principle is very poorly suited to the stock markets , which will still be characterised by their own national features well into the future
As I see it this is partly the situation dealt with by Gener@@ o@@ so An@@ dri@@ a in the report we are discussing today
I@@ t@@ ems 11 and 12 explore the most desirable way of organising securities trading settlement services and the relationship between the central securities depos@@ itories and the cust@@ o@@ dian banks
Unfortunately I cannot agree with Mr An@@ dri@@ a 's proposed solution on these two points
There are considerably more differences between Member States in arrangements for securities trading clearing and settlement and cust@@ o@@ dian services than in securities trading on the stock exchange
Owing to national laws relating to limited companies , the status of the German shareholder differs essentially from that of the Finnish shareholder in company transactions , for example
In the systems in continental Europe custody is nom@@ ine@@ e registered , and the investor has no direct contact with the issuer
If a directive should be issued on this matter , the Commission 's approach , which takes account of these differences in the markets , should be adhered to
In my country , Finland , for example , Finnish issuers have , in their everyday activities , had a high opinion of value-added services based on registers of shareholders
The giant No@@ k@@ ia , for example , considers them to be very important
The rapporteur , Mr An@@ dri@@ a , is trying to repair a situation here that works fine
This being the case I would like to stress the importance of accepting these two amendments , and I also hope that my group will support them
This communication builds on the Gi@@ ov@@ ann@@ ini report of November 2001 , which identified many sources of inefficiency in cross-border clearing and settlement arrangements within the European Union
It is essential to manage the potentially high risks of clearing and settlement systems effectively , to ensure the stability of the financial system
Pan@@ -European infrastructures are essential to an integrated financial market , with market participants , regulators and competition authorities all playing a role
Now the same principle must be applied to post-@@ trading infrastructure
In concentrating the services in one or two main players we must be sure that we do not risk security in the event of institutional collapse
Proper safeguards will be needed
The American model is obviously an attractive tem@@ plate
It is very efficient in its delivery of cost-effective clearing and settlement
But such radical departure from our present systems of up to 20 central security depos@@ itories and very different legal frameworks would probably make it very difficult to achieve
An early step will no doubt be the revision of the investment services directive which provides for the possibility of choice of systems for post-@@ trading activity
I find it regrettable that our rapporteur has largely disregarded this self-evident truth
We are all in agreement with the Commission that it is right to make the cross-border clearing and settlement systems more efficient and to cut their costs
It does not inevitably follow , though , that we need a European legislative instrument in order to do this
What is first required is that the technical barriers within the EU be dismantled
In this area , though , nonsense is a public menace
My hair stands on end at the sight of the proposal that core settlement services should be handled by a service subject to the rules applicable to non-profit organisations
Such a proposal simply ignores the fact that a single legal system is capable of being applied only if laws on securities and taxation have already been standardised
There are enough examples to demonstrate the fact that the achievement of profit and reductions in cost are not mutually exclusive
Indeed , if I understand him right , the Commissioner has , in this House , declared himself to be in favour of a market-based approach
There are today many sectors in which a policy of moderate deregulation is being pursued and in which the market is being opened up
Healthy competition - which already exists - has always benefited the consumer
Contrary to what the rapporteur would have us believe , that is not frag@@ men@@ ta@@ tion; that is competition
In view of these considerations , Mrs Kauppi and I have tabled amendments , and I hope that Members will support them
Both in my personal capacity and as our group 's co-ordin@@ ator , I repudiate any and every personal attack upon the rapporteur
It is a matter of political good form that opposing views are to be accepted as such and that one engages with them without simply dis@@ missing them as nonsense
The report presented by Mr An@@ dri@@ a has been passed , by a clear majority , by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs
The creation of an integrated financial market is not alone in still facing too many obstacles , hindrances and barriers , and the costs involved are still excessive
Historically speaking , we know that the settlement systems within the European Union have developed along different lines
Yes , we have excessive costs
Reference has been made to reports that make it clear that barriers are among the causes of this
A study carried out jointly by the German stock exchange and C@@ lear@@ stream has clearly shown that overall transaction costs resulting from barriers amount to some EUR 4
We all want a level playing field
We all want improved access , and many of us believe that the structures of power mean that regulatory intervention is contrary to functional approaches to regulation
There is , moreover , the desire that all these services should be able to be performed by both banks and central securities depos@@ itories
Hence the amendments , and we hope that the debate has also demonstrated to the Commission the need for the various stand@@ points to be reconsidered
We await a proposal for a directive , which will make it possible to move this debate on to a more concrete phase
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
in the European Union , the proportion of the population over the age of 65 will rise from 16
1 % in 2000 to 22 % in 20@@ 25 and 27 % in 20@@ 50 , that is a third of the population
At the same time people over the age of 80 , who made up 3
6 % of the population in 2000 are likely to make up 6 % in 20@@ 25 and 10 % in 20@@ 50
In order to meet these objectives , the cooperation of all health care professionals is required
Another key aspect to take into account is the risk of overemphas@@ ising the importance of the goal of financial viability at the expense of accessibility and quality
Well , the thorny question of ageing of the population is important in this context
Mr President , I should like to start by thanking Mr Mantovani and the honourable Members for their report
The Commission will be taking account of the proposals and recommendations made in it
The fact that the report is in favour of Community cooperation to improve health care in the European Union is very important
As you know , the Barcelona European Council called on the Commission and the Member States to work together in this sector
The Commission presented its first communication in December 2001 and this parliamentary report is in response to it
A series of questionnaires was sent to the Member States in the autumn
They have now been returned and the Commission is working on a new report which will be presented to the Employment Council and then to the European Council in 2003
I should like to point out that this whole procedure centres around social protection rather than care issues
This entire process forms part of a coordinated strategy to modernise social protection systems
The Commission proposed this strategy in 1999 as part of the social agenda under the Lisbon strategy
We are working constantly on the comparability of the data and indic@@ es needed to facilitate cooperation between the Member States
Obviously , the entire procedure comes under the Community strategy on public health and the Community action programme which has finally been approved and to which Mr Berend referred
Mr Mantovani 's report also examines a whole series of other issues relating to public health and the free movement of people and services on the internal market
These are important issues which we shall continue to work on , using appropriate political tools and bearing in mind that they need to be complementary and cohesive
I should like to finish with the candidate countries
Last year , my services started a series of studies into the social protection systems in the 13 candidate countries and they are currently examining health care systems
The conclusions of these studies , which were discussed in Brussels on 5 and 6 December , will be available to you shortly
Mr President , as has already been said , this is one of the major issues facing the European Union
As the elderly population increases , we need to work out ways of coping with it and to find a strategy across the European Union which really works
But this is ultimately the responsibility of Member States
Our challenge is to ensure that Member States carry on with their own provision , but with coordination and cooperation and the sharing of best practice throughout the European Union
We must also be aware that not all elderly people fall into the same category
So we need to find a sustainable way of keeping people active and healthy for as long as possible
I welcome Mr Mantovani 's report and the Commission communication
in fact , an ever-increasing number of nurses will be needed
In order to ensure care for all , however , the European Union Member States need to take steps to raise young people 's awareness of par@@ a@@ medical professions
The solution to this problem must be implemented quickly since it concerns all the Member States
This employment problem could be resolved in part though the transfer of qualified resources from one sector to another
The mobility and retraining of the unemployed engineering workers who hold an advanced secondary education qualification could be achieved by providing them with access to information on nursing
The rapporteur has already mentioned the percentage of the European population over the age of 65 , 16 % , an estimated 22 % and 27
5 % for 20@@ 25 and 20@@ 50 , and that the number of people over 80 is going to increase as well , from 3
The demographic situation is obviously a success for society , which can be attributed to medical care and an improvement in living conditions in general
El@@ der@@ ly people do not make up an homogenous group and their needs therefore also vary
No society - including European society - can afford not to take advantage of the contributions elderly people can make in terms of their experience , training and knowledge
These principles would be deprived of content if they were not accompanied by policies to turn them into realities
Heal@@ th@@ care systems must face a triple challenge
I believe these are three necessary , minimal and laudable objectives , and I would like to draw attention to the close link between them
This will allow a balance between the three objectives
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start by extending my very warm thanks to Mr Mantovani for his excellent cooperation
I think we have succeeded in securing a broad majority in tomorrow 's plenary for this most important report
In matters of health policy , the EU is still catching up with reality
In many fields , after all , a European health policy already exists - the E@@ u@@ reg@@ i@@ os spring to mind
New mechanisms are constantly being tried out , but , as yet , nobody has made the great breakthrough
The Commission does not , and the Council very definitely does not
The organisation and funding of health care systems is a matter decided at the national level and should remain so in future
It is far more a case of how we are to retain , in the long term , our European model of a health care policy based on solidarity
I am speaking quite deliberately in terms of a European model , as the following four principles underlie all health care systems
The first is that health is not , and must not be allowed to become , a purely economic commodity
The second is that equal access to health services is a fundamental right and must remain one
The third is that , as has already been said , all systems of health care are based upon the principle of solidarity
And the fourth is that the State has a crucial role to play in regulating , funding and providing services
Now , the Mantovani report makes quite practical proposals as to what enhanced European cooperation in health care policy might be like
These proposals have to do with methodology , objectives and specific content
Com@@ parable data are absolutely indispensable here , but to date the EU has not even had a standard measurement of mortality rates
This is where we can even now make progress by using the new action programme on health care policy
We do all , after all , want the EU to be able to keep on , in future , using legislation to supplement the Member States ' policies
Mr President , I should like to begin by thanking Mr Mantovani for the work he has done on this report
I say that , even though there are features of the report in its final form with which my group disagrees
It indicates a number of overriding goals in terms of access , quality and financial sustainability
Over and above this , it points out that , in many areas , the EU has opportunities to make joint contributions under the current rules
We therefore have a host of opportunities for cooperating under the existing rules
It is a good form of cooperation in which a number of common objectives are set that can be achieved in different ways
In some areas , open coordination is directly authorised by the treaties
That applies in the case of economic policy and employment policy
In other areas , there is a less obvious basis in the treaties , or else there is really no basis
It might be said that the Member States have every possible freedom to decide to coordinate their efforts and develop good practice
In addition , the parties concerned are very actively involved
I think it would be wrong of us to allow the use of open coordination to escalate to the point of its being used in every possible area
It is of course a basic principle of EU cooperation that we accept diversity and difference
It is an advantage that we have many different models so that we can learn from each other
We must not s@@ ne@@ ak harmonisation in through the back door in areas where national competence should clearly apply
That is not something for which we would be thanked
Cooperation will develop via the internal market , as a result of that internal market and through other cooperation , such as cooperation on research
As for a common EU policy on residential homes , however , my response is no thank you
The Commission communication on this subject , which the report welcomes despite some occasional criticisms , is indicative of the contradictions in social policies
This could lead to the liberalisation and privatisation of an essential public service , which health certainly is , whilst ultimately jeopardising equality of access to high-quality health services
The challenge here therefore remains that of achieving some coherence amongst those who say that they are committed to defending health care and care for the elderly
Mr President , I welcome the opportunity for debate on this report , on what is an important issue for all our countries
I am grateful to Mr Mantovani for his work
C@@ aring for the ageing population throughout Europe will be one of the biggest challenges facing the Member States in the future
Although , as has already been said , the organisation of health care is a matter reserved for Member States , they cannot do this in isolation
That is why my group welcomes the cooperation suggested by the Commission , in terms of exchanging information and best practice and developing common quality standards
Dra@@ wing comparisons and exploring the care systems within Member States could be a valuable way of highlighting successful solutions
The reduction in costs would not be temporary or short term , but long term
For example , we know that older women and people in rural areas experience greater levels of poverty
In my constituency in Wales , three out of five older people live in poverty
Most pensioners depend entirely on their state pension or other state benefits as their only income
More people have long-term illnesses in Wales than in England or Scotland
These facts are not unrelated
Some methods of health prevention and early detection of illness are essential
Trying to establish a free market of care and treatment and harmonising health care systems has its dangers
Meeting the Stability Pact requirements , whilst providing the necessary funding for health , welfare and social services , is a major challenge
Health care , as I said earlier , is the responsibility of the Member States
The references in this report to an internal market in health services and products reflects the move towards liberalisation
My group believes that health care and the care of the elderly is too important to be put at risk by privatisation and the GATS Agreement
The focus of this report and one of the main issues in this debate must be equality of access
This means access to care for everyone and securing a local supply of services
GATS threatens this
How we provide care and services for people is how we will be judged
Health care and care of the elderly , whilst an important part of the overall health system , does not necessarily represent the overall health system
There is a tendency in the report to assume that issues concerning health care of the elderly apply to the health system as a whole
A detailed study on the financing of long-term care for older people is being carried out in my own country , Ireland
I look forward to examining the policy proposals which this will bring forward
Particular attention has been paid in the report to meeting long-term care needs , reducing unnecessary recourse to institutional care and widening consumer choice
In Ireland we have a very active health policy to give old people a better way of life
I am able to support Amendments Nos 7 to 11 on replacing the ' open method of cooperation ' with ' cooperation '
We have been developing our own health strategy which includes payments and allowances for care@@ rs , including care@@ rs looking after two or more people
Another aspect I want to highlight is the changing role of the family and community
We must ensure that support is put in place to allow people to remain in their families and their local communities as much as possible
Shar@@ ing information in these areas can only be beneficial
These are now being included in the report by Mr Mantovani
That is a welcome move
There are many organisations that want to work in assisting the elderly
This year - 2003 - is the year of the disabled
There are many elderly people who suffer from disabilities as well
This is a Dutch expression about the consequences of getting older
After all , age generally comes with ail@@ ments
A@@ il@@ ments which , with proper attention and care , a person can live with
This proper attention and care involves people
People who provide the necessary hand@@ s-@@ on care
With the support of good policy and the commitment of politicians , this can be accommodated
Mr Mantovani 's report aims to provide the space to do so from a European perspective
He puts forward a range of proposals based on a great concern about the demographic trend towards an ageing population and the consequences this will have for our health systems
The report is bri@@ m@@ ming over with the politics of good intentions
Good intentions alone will not , in my opinion , be the main@@ spring of political and policy-@@ related activities
Certainly not if Europe would have to be given new powers on such a basis
As@@ signing powers to European institutions is a failure to appreciate the fact that care is provided between people at the micro level
Promoting good healthcare and exchanging good practices are points I endorse
El@@ der@@ ly people and patients are more than just an item of expense to society
The number of new policy-@@ coordinating proposals and inventories will not , in my opinion , promote good care and assistance but will rather impede it
In my country there is a lot of discussion about healthcare at the moment
Do@@ zens of rules , procedures and administrative obligations are impeding the work of nurses and care@@ rs
If one thing has become clear , it is that we need hands at the be@@ d@@ side and not at the computer
Although many of Mr Mantovani 's ideas appeal to me , I cannot endorse his report
The report misunderstands the position of the concept of subsidiarity when it comes to the role of Europe and the role of the Member States in these areas of policy
The report furthermore disregards day-to-day practice
Pr@@ acti@@ ce is not waiting for new rules from Europe , it is waiting for people who want to do the work
You will understand that I do not regard the European institutions and the Convention as being assigned a role in the policy areas of care for the elderly and healthcare
I therefore support Mrs Lynne 's amendments concerning scrapping paragraphs 18 and 20
This will ensure that responsibility for healthcare and care for the elderly remains with the national governments
It is there that the parameters are established and a substantive policy can be pursued that enables us to respond to the people 's demand for care
Finally , I would like to point out the importance of inter@@ relationships between people in family , church or home circles
That is where the care is provided in practice , at the micro level
It is pointless worrying about care , you have to go out and do it
Mr President , let me begin by disagreeing with Mr Blokland for once , and I will explain to Hans why later
I would like wholeheartedly to support the proposal from the European Commission , together with my colleague 's , Mr Mantovani 's , proposal
In Europe we all have the same problem
We all have healthcare that is expanding , certainly financially
Because we are dealing with emancip@@ ated citizens , citizens who have a different lifestyle , citizens who want more and who want better quality
We also have facilities that are making healthcare more expensive
Incidentally , I must now make a critical comment about the communication from the European Commission
In the Netherlands , healthcare is not financed via taxes but via premi@@ um@@ s; the situation is therefore different from what it says in the communication
That is therefore something that we can learn from one another
Firstly via the article in the Treaty in which achieving a high level of healthcare protection is stated as an objective
Incidentally , Hans , Dutch citizens benefit a lot from this
Secondly via the deepening of the internal market; we do in fact have a great deal to say about appliances and certainly also about medicines
In this case I am thinking about the whole range of medicines , for example
If we were to do something about generic medicines , we would be able to save EUR 500 million a year in our country alone
do something about it , start taking targeted action on this point in consultation with your colleague Mr Byrne
Now to go back briefly to that high level of protection
Furthermore , we cannot declare a certain treatment to be experimental
No , that has all been tested by the European Court of Justice
In any event the first reports reveal that we can learn an awful lot from one another
The European citizens are asking for it for essential elements of their lives such as health
Are these generations an asset to modern society , yes or no ?
My reply is yes , a resounding yes
In France today , 40 % of people reti@@ ring receive less than EUR 1 000 per month
Statistics indicate that by 2005 , 30 % will be approaching the poverty line
So yes , of course , funding for social protection needs to be reviewed
The problem is deciding on the principles according to which this should take place
As@@ king questions about the future of retirement and care therefore equates to making social choices
How can we address the causes of the debt , how can we increase the number of those participating in the national solidarity effort ?
By combating unemployment by means of employment policies or by making redundancies and closing businesses ?
This would open the way for the attitude of pension funds which are more interested in gaining a market share than in worrying about any kind of health policy
I personally cannot envisage care being distributed according to budget
Is there not already a risk when , for example , in the United Kingdom , dialysis is no longer funded after the age of 75 ?
On the other hand , I am sure that social benefits such as those under the French retirement system should be strengthened
In France , seven trade unions have been asking for this recently
Their joint platform demands a high-level retirement provision
They are also calling for demonstrations throughout the country on 1 February
Lastly , we have the resources to ensure a high-level retirement provision
Lastly , I would like to express my total opposition to increasing the duration of working life in France and in Europe , as recommended by the Barcelona European Council
Mr President , as a visibly gre@@ ying member of the population I have a considerable interest in this debate , as do many others in this House
I have some concern about the climate of it
One way of improving the situation is to pay reasonable wages to well-trained and qualified staff
I am aware that non-@@ medical care is one of the fastest growing areas in terms of job creation
However , it is all too often very poorly paid , it is often done by women , by migrant women , and the staff are often recruited with difficulty
It is certainly a boom area for temporary work agencies in the UK
I am not saying that women should be forced to stay at home
But it means that we must look carefully at the financial and social support for care@@ rs , which should reflect the much larger costs that society would otherwise bear
We also need to recognise that care@@ rs who are in work need leave provision , not just parents
We need to look at the employment needs of care@@ rs
I am pleased to say that the equal funding is being used for at least one such project involving the UK
Some of my other concerns also focus on the issue of discrimination in the provision of health care for the elderly
This is observed in quite a number of Member States
It is a useful area for comparison between Member States and might at some point be part of another horizontal directive for Article 13
We mentioned in the debate the issue of an adequate income for older people
It is also an issue of cross-border service providers and increasing provision from third country providers
It is certainly the view of my group that such services should not be included
It is also clear that at some point we will need a framework for the cross-border liability of service providers
I agree with Mr Crowley on the issue of risk equalisation in the private sector , to avoid ch@@ err@@ y-@@ picking of the purely profitable
We have to look further at what constitutes goods or services in health and other care
I am aware that Denmark has already introduced legislation on this
It would be another useful area for comparison in an open method of coordination
I found in the report the word ' Ü@@ ber@@ alter@@ ung '
Let us at last stop using these stupid expressions about the super@@ ann@@ uation or ger@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ fication of Europe
Even though you can read it all over the media , it is quite simply not true
Never have there been so many people alive in Europe as there are today and never before has there been such high life expectancy as there is now
As recently as 150 years ago , average life expectancy was around 40 years , and now it is 80
Any girl born today has the chance to live to a hundred
People today have the good fortune to be able , at long last , to live to an age that has in fact always been genetically possible
So let us stop talking about any ger@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ fication of Europe or about its super@@ ann@@ uation
I assume that this has simply escaped your notice
Please stop talking about people being super@@ ann@@ u@@ ated
Let me make another comment
In the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , I tabled a whole series of amendments , all of which were adopted
There is one amendment of which I am particularly proud , Commissioner , and it is one that I should especially like to commend to you
I think it is a great thing that the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy has adopted this amendment
I hope that we will do the same when we vote tomorrow
Commissioner , I commend this matter to your care
the human lif@@ esp@@ an is increasing constantly while external signs of ageing are decreasing significantly
Others find it regre@@ tt@@ able; I find it regrettable for them , because they will be old one day too
Lastly , others , myself included , think and say that we must grasp the nettle
That phenomenon is the result of low birth rates and increased life expectancy , especially amongst women
In less than one decade , between 1990 and 1999 , the number of women over 65 has increased by nearly 3 %
The effects of an ageing population are being felt at various levels
At the same time , the increase in the number of elderly persons is imposing a greater burden on health care and social services
The issue we face is a simple and in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive one
Society cannot be said to be progressing if greater life expectancy is not matched by improvements in quality of life
This will inevitably make demands on public finance , which plays a key part in expenditure on health in all the Member States
An ageing population will have a considerable impact on budgets , which will in turn increase public expenditure
Health care systems in the European Union should therefore be pursuing the objective of being simultaneously accessible , high in quality and financially viable
Each Member State is responsible for the organisation and financing of its own social protection system
Nevertheless , this responsibility is increasingly being exercised in an overall context that affects various Community policies
Beyond that , however , how can we talk about the future of health and care for the elderly without raising the problem of pensions ?
On the pretext of modernisation , numerous governments within the Union are increasingly attacking pensions and current and future pensioners
In France , just over the past fifteen years , following various reforms , the level of pensions has decreased by some 30 %
The report emphasises prevention
The first step in prevention , however , is guaranteeing acceptable living conditions for pensioners
We must not accept being told that this is impossible and that the ratio of people of working age to those of non-@@ working age does not allow it
In order to guarantee dignity for pensioners , we must agree to di@@ p into these profits or the income of the wealthy
All these serve the purpose of ensuring that our social security system continues to be financially viable , because that is what is needed
Action is needed , on the part of all of and us at every political level
A survey by Eurostat , a few days ago , showed that in 2002 there were fewer bir@@ ths , but more deaths , recorded in the EU
The number of live bir@@ ths in the EU reached 3
68 million people died in the EU , which amounts to some 60 000 more than in 2001
These figures alone show that our society faces a change which will affect policy on social security , employment , finance and the economy
There is just one aspect that I would like to pick out - that of care
In my country - Austria - alone , 5@@ 40 000 people are at present in need of help and care
This figure will increase to just over 800 000 by 2011
Only 26 % require or receive additional help or avail themselves of it
Demo@@ graphic and economic changes mean , though , that the family members who provide care are becoming fewer in number
The number of people employed in the care field has increased by 5
5 % , so the health and welfare sector is creating jobs
Under@@ development of many areas of the mobile care and support services means that far from all the sufficiently trained staff can be employed
I therefore demand certain things above all in this context
There is a need for a build-up of resources in personal environments and for more extensive support both for recipients of care and for their families
In my view , though , we also need uniform standards of training and professional development , as aid is often required across national boundaries
Care is one of the greatest challenges of our time , and we need European standards for it
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
( The sitting was closed at 11
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on Afghanistan , one year after the Bonn Agreement
Mr Y@@ iann@@ it@@ sis , President-in-Office of the Council , has the floor
Once a transitional authority and administration had been set up , an emergency Loya Jirga was convened and elected a president
A Judicial Commission and an Independent Human Rights Commission have been set up
A central bank has been established and has introduced a national currency
A drafting committee has been set up as a fore@@ run@@ ner to a Constitutional Commission
A proposal has been adopted for a national development framework , which will be used as a guide for rebuilding and improving the situation in the country
President Karzai has issued a decree creating an Afghan national army , an important step towards Afghan ownership in the field of security and stability
Generally speaking , President Karzai and the Afghan Transitional Administration have achieved substantial results and the Bonn Process is on the right track
Both the Afghan Transitional Administration and the international community , however , still have a great many challenges to meet between now and then
Progress needs to be made in these sectors in order to boost the confidence of the Afghan people , which is the key to support for the administration
The whole idea behind the Bonn Agreement was that transitional arrangements should be based on traditional , local , national and religious structures in Afghanistan
And every effort must be made to ensure there is proper representation , in accordance with rules introduced by the central administration
Security continues to be a priority and we feel that all the Afghan groups should be encouraged to solve their grievances in a peaceful manner
Re@@ building the country 's economy should also be a priority
As part of this , we need to encourage the Tokyo donors to make the promised funds available through the national investment budget presented by the Afghan administration
Naturally , Community aid to Afghanistan will continue to be provided on terms dictated by the basic principles and values we subscribe to as members of western society
Community aid must be geared to rebuilding a stable nation , improving the food supply and supporting the return of refugees and ex@@ iles
Unless democratic values , pluralism and the respect for human rights , including women 's rights , are strengthened , there can be no social or political development in Afghanistan
If Afghanistan is to enter modern statehood , it needs to reform its security , administrative , judicial , financial and social domains
We welcome the fact that a constitutional drafting committee has been set up to draft a constitution which will modernise the judicial system and protect human rights
However , we note that the Civil Service Commission is not yet fully functioning
The European Union is committed to contributing to the work of these bodies
The Judicial Commission needs to be strengthened if it is to improve the procedural system
We welcome Italy 's contribution here in organising the conference on the Afghan legal system in Rome last December
We need timetables and benchmarks here in order to ensure the provisions of the Bonn agreement are applied
2003 will be a crucial year for Afghanistan and will most likely decide the future shape of the country
We have reiterated the European Union 's continued commitment to delivering a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of Afghanistan
Mr President , I very much welcome this opportunity , with my colleague Mr I@@ on@@ it@@ sis , to discuss progress in Afghanistan over the past year
But timing is critic@@ al; there is - as the Minister properly underlined - a limited window of opportunity which we have to exploit
Unless President Karzai and his Government manage to strengthen their position throughout the country , then there is a risk that these early gains will be lost
But before turning to the substantial challenges that lie ahead , I would like to say something about the successes of 2002 , successes accomplished in extremely difficult circumstances
Only a year ago donors met in Tokyo to pledge over USD 1
Much has since been achieved in Afghanistan
The track record of the European Union and the European Commission has been , I think one can fairly say , particularly impressive
By early December , EUR 7@@ 55 million of the total European Union commitment of over EUR 8@@ 30 million had actually been disbursed
I must say that I am very proud of the quality of the EC assistance programme and the speed with which it has been delivered
It is also fair to pay tribute to the excellent staff we have at the newly set-up EC office in Kabul
I would also like to pay tribute to the Special Representative , who brings so much knowledge and so much expertise to his extremely challenging work
The Commission , along with the Swedish government and Pakistan , has already started the emergency rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Kab@@ ul@@ -@@ J@@ al@@ al@@ ab@@ ad@@ -@@ Tor@@ k@@ ham road and full reconstruction will start next year
In addition , our humanitarian aid has helped to support the return of over 1
8 million refugees to Afghanistan
Over EUR 70 million has been spent by ECHO in 2002
I do not think anybody can suggest that we have not played - or are not still playing - our full part so far in the reconstruction of Afghanistan
For 2003 , the challenge will be to consolidate this early progress
The Commission will continue to play a leading role
We anticipate total development assistance of about EUR 1@@ 85 million , and there will also be continued humanitarian assistance from ECHO of between EUR 45 and 55 million
That means that we will be spending in Afghanistan this year , on present estimates , between EUR 230 and 240 million
Colleagues will recall that at Tokyo on behalf of the Commission I pledged EUR 1 billion over five years in reconstruction assistance
Some people in the past have deri@@ ded that sort of work as nation-building or social work
Success in 2003 will h@@ inge on three key issues
First , the need to improve internal security
Second , the need to ensure human rights are fully respected , including those of women and minorities
The third key issue for us is the need for continued long-term commitment from donors and for effective coordination
Internal security is critical not only for the future of Afghanistan but also to the delivery of aid
Aid workers must be able to work without fear of recrimination
I think sometimes we underestimate the amounts of courage and commitment which are required for aid workers working in these sort of circumstances
The Government must press on quickly with the creation of a National Army , but clearly this will not be achieved overnight
The Minister has already referred to our concern about this
If you look at the present UN figures , there is very considerable reason not just for concern , but alarm
I believe that we have to give far more attention to this problem in the next year or so , a problem which directly affects political authority in Afghanistan itself
Overall , as agreed at the Bonn II meeting , we need tangible benchmarks to measure progress
These are critical not only to shape our vision of Afghanistan 's future , but to provide support to the reform@@ ers within the Government
This is of critical importance for human rights
Recent reports highlight the unacceptable situation faced by minority groups , and women , in some parts of the country
Clearly , these issues are vital in view of the general elections which are scheduled for mid 2004
We also cannot hope to deliver sustainable change without good donor coordination
I would like to finish by stressing that we must be prepared for the long haul - regardless of other events that may unfold in 2003
Re@@ building a cohesive state will take time , as will improving the unacceptably low levels of education and healthcare
I want to assure Parliament of my personal commitment to these tasks
I paid a first trip to Kabul in May 2002 and will be returning this February as part of a trip to the Central Asian Re@@ public@@ s
I intend to make one of the priorities of my visit the discussion of the better coordination of donor efforts , including the work done by NGOs
The support received from this House has been very reassuring , especially in helping to secure funding for Afghanistan for 2003
It is sometimes difficult for the international community to focus on more than one or two bli@@ ps on its ra@@ d@@ ar screen at any one moment
There is a huge job for us to do in Afghanistan
There are worrying tasks for the international community in the Central Asian Re@@ public@@ s and there are reasons for concern about the situation in Pakistan
So I hope that we can continue to focus on this work in the years ahead , whatever the tragic distr@@ actions may be elsewhere
What is the situation today ?
President Karzai 's government continues to work through the transitional administration to promote stability , democracy and prosperity in Afghanistan
Secondly , the fight against the fundamentalist fanaticism of the supporters of Al-@@ Q@@ ai@@ da and Mul@@ lah Om@@ ar has still not been won
There are strong grounds for believing that they may still be receiving support from the ' ' uncontrolled ' ' areas of neighbouring territories
We call for the creation of a proper agency to provide the necessary coordination
Mr President , to those who have been there , who have stood on the mountains , who know the people , Afghanistan is a beautiful country
The Afghan people are a strong people who deserve our support
The liberation of Afghanistan by the international coalition against terrorism , against the Taliban and against the Al-@@ Q@@ ai@@ da network has fortunately been very successful
Commissioner Patten has rightly said that this is in no small measure thanks to the efforts of the European Union
There is a new provisional government , and no fewer than 1
At the same time , this success is being threatened by the diversion of some of the very important international players to a new play@@ ground - Iraq
It would be very tragic if the international coalition against terrorism were to allow itself to become divided and diverted towards Iraq
Human rights , women 's rights and reconstruction are threatened on a daily basis in these regions
The important agreement which Afghanistan concluded with its neighbours on 22 December last year should thus also be given another chance
Only then will Afghans have sufficient trust , and only then will they have the opportunity to take the reconstruction into their own hands
Almost two million refugees have returned , and 700 000 are tre@@ k@@ king around inside Afghanistan - in other words , they are internally displaced
Free and fair elections must be held and a new constitution prepared in 2004
The preparations for these elections are essential , as this is the way to actually establish a broad gender-@@ sensitive , multi-ethnic and representative government
Tre@@ mendous steps have been taken
I therefore very strongly support the view of the Greek Presidency and of Commissioner Patten
Let us use the substantial amounts we have at our disposal for the coming year , coupled with our effort , in a focused way
Given everything that is happening elsewhere in the world , we must make a success of Afghanistan now
That will only work if we maintain this focus during the coming year
Mr President , may I first congratulate the Greek minister for taking up the Presidency
We look forward with confidence to a very successful and very effective six months
The President today commented that our aim must be to bring Afghanistan into a modern statehood
Women 's rights give increasing cause for concern , they are not improving , they are becoming worse
Fac@@ ial covering has become mandatory in many parts of the country; the movement of women is heavily restricted
Vir@@ gin@@ ity is examined on the whim of the police , women are dragged into hospitals and physically examined
In other words , women are rever@@ ting to their traditional subordinate role of being the property of the male
The Commissioner has already commented that women 's rights in certain areas of the country are under assault , but I say this is also happening at central government level
Women are now forbidden to be presen@@ ters on radio or television , which some of them were doing successfully
I have no doubt that women journalists are also under pressure in the written media
Under-@@ representation of women has been commented on already , but I would ask you to recall the famous Loya Jirga , which was almost 100 % male
The word Afghanistan translates correctly into the words ' the land of sorrow and suffering '
For women Afghanistan is becoming , yet again , the land of their deepest sorrow and suffering
Humanitarian aid undoubtedly helps , but just as obviously it is simply not enough
I warmly congratulate both ECHO and the entire Commission involved in Afghanistan , for their fantastic work
It is not so today
women 's rights are just not there
Yet if we mean business , this attitude must be tackled , and it is an attitude , a tribal culture in Bal@@ uch@@ istan , which has spread around the region
Why be so squ@@ e@@ am@@ ish about tackling women 's rights ?
Is it because Afghanistan is an Islamic society ?
I urge you , alter the priorities of the Council of Ministers , place women 's rights high on the agenda
If we fail on that , then we will have no success at all
However , values should not just be descri@@ be@@ d; justice , the fight against poverty and peace must be pursued in difficult circumstances
In reality , the more we talk about peace , the more war there is; there is talk of negotiations while troops are being prepared
I shall not give any further examples , since the world is such a big and terrible place
Is this rhetoric or senti@@ mentality ?
One year on from the Bonn Agreement and clearly many positive steps have been taken
The Commission 's facts and Commissioner Patten 's outstanding analyses , which I shall not dwell on as he read them out very clearly , are impressive
We all know that in a situation where there is devastation such as this , there are no short@@ cuts to achieving common interests without destroying specific aspects
We must therefore carry out investigations for UNA@@ M@@ A
we must give continuity to our work and our commitment
Mr President , four months ago we took part in another debate about Afghanistan in this very room , with some of the same people
To be honest , I have little to add to Baroness Nicholson 's impressive arguments on that point
I do , however , think that the time has come to do more than just acknowledge that the position of women has deteriorated over the past year
Kofi Annan has described this extension as a precondition for continuing stability in Afghanistan
If not , please tell me; then we will not have this illusion hanging over our heads
I am convinced that this is necessary , otherwise there will be no stability anywhere at all in Afghanistan
Why is it so necessary to extend the ISAF 's mandate ?
That has everything to do with what I would call the perverse return of the warlords
we must not use the warlords in the fight against Al-@@ Q@@ ai@@ da again
Some of the warlords are still being supported financially but also with weapons in the context of the fight against terrorism
This must come to an end
Otherwise everything we have been discussing here about reforms will simply have no chance at all
Take , for example , the fact that many warlords and generals are govern@@ ors at the same time
This only advances their stand@@ ing; this really must come to an end
The position of the ISAF has started to suffer , even in Kabul
There are increasing numbers of incidents , and the present Turkish comm@@ anding officer has rightly warned that this situation will only worsen in the event of an attack on Iraq
If the ISAF 's mandate is not extended , if the role of the warlords is not diminished , the reforms will simply have no chance at all
A key issue for development , in fact , is to expand agriculture , which will take land away from opium cultivation
The removal of the Taliban regime has now provided the opportunity for reconstruction
The question arises , however , of to what extent both the military victors and the present government have the authority to achieve real stability and get reconstruction underway
We cannot fail to observe that the stability needed to get real aid efforts to the whole of the country is not in place
Are we not deceiving ourselves when much of the reconstruction work is going on only in Kabul ?
The country as a whole needs aid to be provided quickly , but it must then be distributed fairly
This is also a point of view that it is not wise to express openly
Even though it is not politically correct to make this connection , I fear that this is the case or , at least , that the danger is real
Anyone who knows Afghanistan 's history will be aware that foreign troops have never felt at home there for long
Mr President-in-Office , I fully endorse your presentation of the situation in Afghanistan
I think we all feel a reserved satisfac@@ tion; we all see the continuing shortcomings in Afghanistan and we all know what has to be done over coming years
There is no need for me to repeat what we are all agreed on
I should like to highlight two points which should not be left out of any discussion of Afghanistan
One is the terrible events which have taken place in the name of the fight against terrorism
I am behind the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan or anywhere else 100 %
The warlords and the Taliban were never our allies
It was not the European Union that trained , armed and helped the Taliban through Pakistan
It was not us who created the forces we are now fighting against
I should like to add to today 's debate on Afghanistan by mentioning two very dark sides to this war
I think the UN has an obligation both to investigate and examine these allegations closely and to make known and publish the results of their enquiries
The European Union should do something about this , it is a disgrace
Together with some Socialist members of the European Parliament , I went to Afghanistan in November
That is the first thing I wanted to say because the European Commission is doing outstanding work out there
I remember Bonn just over a year ago
I also remember that in the European Parliament we produced a report on the role of women in armed conflicts , both as victims and as players
I would like to speak about both at the same time
We can speak of both at the same time today given what the Afghan population is expecting of Europe
we have a responsibility to the Afghan people , who are expecting a lot from us
Coming back to the position of women , this is a very complex problem , but at the same time what is clear is the need to be precise
In a few weeks ' time there will be an Afghan constitution
A committee was set up in November to draft one and the nine people on that committee include two women
But what exactly do we mean when we speak of the place of Afghan women in the constitution ?
We hear talk of a return to the 19@@ 64 constitution
it is extremely vague about human rights in general and women 's rights in particular
They are saying the same thing in Afghanistan
We know that no legal text , no constitution since the Second World War , fails to make specific mention of women 's rights
It therefore seems to me to be important , as you said , Commissioner , that we should ensure the Afghan constitution mentions women
In my opinion , based on the talks we had on the ground , that is not a certainty
But it is something we must press for
That is why I am stressing this point so strongly , as I did at my various meetings in the country
Women 's rights are revealing
They are revealing not only in times of conflict , they are also revealing in terms of the state of a society as a whole
Remember what Four@@ ri@@ er used to say , that freedom for women was a measure of social change
The reality is , however , rather different
Women 's rights , as has already been mentioned , are also consistently being violated
In Afghanistan , in the Her@@ at province under the govern@@ or@@ ship of Is@@ mail K@@ han , the situation has deteriorated
Whereas once there was a liberal , literary and cultural tradition , women are again being persecuted and barred from education , health care and the justice system
Even under the Taliban there was at least a semblance of central control that limited the excesses of these regional auto@@ crats
Now many regions have rever@@ ted to a quasi-@@ dictatorship and reconstruction funds are benefiting regional leaders who are committing human rights abuses politically and financially
UNA@@ M@@ A , the United Nations Assistance Mission to Afghanistan , must stop funding these offending warlords immediately
This is an atrocity that members of the American forces witnessed and did not prevent
I am glad the United Nations and the European Union have now agreed to investigate this alleged crime
Mr President , the reconstruction of Afghanistan has not , in my view , remotely begun , despite the assurances given in the House today
The warlords still maintain their iron grip outside Kabul and women still wear the bur@@ ka and have no rights whatsoever , for instance to education or primary healthcare
Much has been made of women 's rights in Afghanistan , but as I said , nothing has changed
I believe that Afghanistan is only the tip of the iceberg as far as the United States is concerned
Many commentators suggest that it is part of the strategy to ensure access to oil from the Cas@@ p@@ ian Sea
Now the question arises , how many fronts will open up after Afghanistan ?
The American administration is preparing for war on Iraq , with unpredictable consequences that no one will be able to control
They will of course have won control of the Iraqi oil wells , but Afghanistan is ignored
In a recent poll in England , 71 % were against their government participating in a war without the approval of the Security Council
The Iraqi people have suffered death and destruction for the past eleven years under the United States sanctions , as have the people of Afghanistan
We have to look clearly at our policy in the Middle East and elsewhere
I therefore welcome the way in which the new Greek Presidency has made Afghanistan a priority issue or has the desire to do so
Despite the fall of the Taliban regime and the installation of Ham@@ id Karzai as the country 's president , the battle for a stable Afghanistan is far from being won
The balance sheet of events to date can be compared to the well-known glass of water , which is either half full or half empty
This will of course also require the extension of the mandate of ISAF , the International Security Assistance Force
What this indicates in general terms is that it is only with much hesitation that Europeans will commit themselves to long-term involvement , and do so in small stages
The demand that the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force be extended , along with the area under that mandate , is a justified one
To date , alas , it has not borne much relation to reality
In addition , all the countries bordering on Afghanistan need to cooperate in preventing the Al-@@ Q@@ ai@@ da network from regaining strength in the area
A certain amount has been done about this
Nor should we entirely abandon the idea of a real reconstruction agency along the lines of that in Kosovo
That policy must include , as a priority , political help with the passing on of administrative know-how
Mr President , at the invitation of UN mediator Mr Brahimi , I had the privilege of talking to the Afghan leaders at the Bonn Conference
I was consequently able to put to the Afghan leaders the obvious demands that women be included in the provisional and permanent governments and not marginalised in the reconstruction work
Together with non-governmental organisations , the committee arranged a conference for women from Afghanistan
We then presented the joint priorities in a resolution adopted by Parliament during the December 2001 part-session
Why am I giving you this background information ?
It is because I see extremely few traces of it in the joint resolution
There is no mention of women and their human rights
It is the Afghan Government 's priorities , rather than women 's , that are mentioned in the resolution
Nor is there any requirement that all aid projects should be informed by the dimension of equality
Women 's rights are quickly forgotten in the man 's world in which we live
I want to ask the Commission and the Council of Ministers how this is to be interpreted
Have women been forgotten again ?
Are no demands concerning women being made of the Afghan Government ?
Women were victims under both the Northern Alliance and the Taliban
Women are the most important actors in the cause of peace
A policy for Afghanistan must be a policy for the majority , that is to say for women and children
Mr President , I might well continue where my fellow MEP , Mrs Theorin , left off
It is as if many of the things we take very seriously when we make speeches are not really taken seriously in practice
Women 's rights and legal position are among these things
Others are international law and human rights
When the talk turns to Afghanistan , I find myself thinking automatically of those people , including European citizens , who are imprisoned in Gu@@ ant@@ án@@ amo
What has become of their rights ?
What legal system do they come under ?
The United States does not respect international law - of that we are well aware - but nor does it respect its own law
I also find this in stark contrast to the fact that , in other situations , there is a demand that international law be complied with
A very good example is Iraq , which we demand comply with international stipulations and UN resolutions
Another area in which we face similar problems is in relation to the massacre in Ma@@ z@@ ar-@@ i-@@ Shar@@ if
There is quite a lot to suggest that there were American soldiers present
Some people maintain that they took part in the massacre
That being said , we are doing nothing to have this matter thoroughly investigated and have the people responsible brought to trial
I think these double standards are causing us problems
They make matters more difficult in relation to Afghanistan and the Afghan people
Why is it so difficult to bring about change ?
To arrive in Afghanistan or Kabul is to enter a world that is exclusively male
Men with pi@@ er@@ cing eyes sc@@ ow@@ ling at women
Some men may have changed outw@@ ardly , but on the inside they are still the same
When you w@@ ander around the famous Chic@@ ken Street in Kabul , for example , you see women in dirty old bur@@ kas be@@ gging , children be@@ gging , men standing around ch@@ at@@ ting
We must not forget that there is still a culture of men who think that women should not be educated
After all , can we imagine a society in the European Union which provides healthcare without women , where there is education without women , for example ?
This is only one of many examples
Mr President , we must not forget Afghanistan
Our states must be active in this field , which is also a pri@@ or@@ ity; they have all the necessary expertise , Mr President
It is not going to be a quick fix for Afghanistan
It is likely that the democracies will have to maintain a commitment for many years to come
There will be re@@ vers@@ es that will place this commitment under severe strain
I endorse the presidency 's congratulations to the Turkish armed forces , which took over the organisation and command of ISAF from the United Kingdom last June
The fact is that warlords continue to hold sway in many of the more remote areas , and their commitment to peaceful development and democracy is largely non-existent
They are interested in personal power and the fruits of criminal activity
They can be won over - but by anyone
This is in spite of a large Americ@@ an-@@ led counter-@@ insur@@ gency force which operates in parallel to ISAF
At the moment western military forces are operational in Bosnia , Kosovo and Macedonia , as well as in Afghanistan
There will be fresh demands , not only in relation to Iraq , but in other places as well
Afghanistan 's neighbours have been enormously affected by the refugee problem , but equally countries such as the United Kingdom have felt the impact
In recent years Afghans have been the largest single national category of those claiming asylum in the United Kingdom
In due course these people must go home
With this in mind I welcome the Council decision of 29 November to adopt the return action plan for Afghanistan , the first application of this programme
Finally , Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world
This is a consequence of activities by the former Soviet Army and more especially by warring factions over the past ten years
Land@@ mines and their suspected presence are one of the greatest obstacles to reconstruction and return to any sort of normality
We need to find more effective , quicker methods involving local people to overcome the scourge of landmines , not just in Afghanistan , but elsewhere as well
This is not just a question of funds , this is a specific practical area where the Commission has a key role to play and needs even more focus
In this sense , our objectives must be to establish a stable rule of law with stable institutions that allow democracy to function and everyone 's rights to be respected
A great deal of costly work needs to be done@@ ; more to the point , a long-term strategy is needed
do all the forces operating in the area have a common strategy ?
Are they with us or do they have a separate agenda , in which case our common objectives may not be so common after all
If this is true , the best thing we can do for institutional development , democratisation and stabilisation is to involve as many Afghan citizens as possible
Mr President , President-in-Office , Commissioner , the strategic importance of Afghanistan cannot be overestimated
A peaceful and stable Afghanistan is an important bul@@ war@@ k against the resurgence of extremism in the region
One year after the Bonn Conference , it is an opportune time to reflect on the EU 's contribution in restoring peace , stability and credible political structures
Commissioner Patten was right to emphasise the contribution that the EU as a whole and the EU Commission in particular have made during the last year
8 million or so refugees returning to the country
This in an impressive list and the Commission , ECHO and the various aid organisations involved deserve credit
The average aid pledges to Bosnia , Kosovo , East Timor and Rwanda were approximately $ 250 per person , as against $ 75 for Afghanistan
The international community should take note of this
As the Commissioner himself pointed out , investing money earlier is much more effective and more economical than spending money to pick up the pieces afterwards
Given our strong record on aid , I believe we have the moral authority to put pressure on our international partners to translate their verbal pledges into money
We should also use our influence to ensure a proper balance is struck between providing short term relief and undertaking long term reconstruction
The holding of democratic elections next year , the establishment of a national army and the pursuit of good neighbourly relations are all positive steps in the right direction
Mr President , although it was a year ago that Afghanistan 's Taliban regime was top@@ pled , there has been scarcely any improvement in the appalling position of women there
The health care system is a disaster , and an Afghan woman dies , either as a result of pregnancy or in child@@ birth , every 20 minutes
That is the highest rate recorded worldwide
The education system had collapsed utterly
Today , girls ' schools are again vulnerable to attacks by fundamentalists
Most Afghan women are barred from taking up employment , and they have little or no share in political power or in the work of reconstruction
The European Union is helping in so far as it is able
Let us take a look into the future
I urge Parliament 's Bureau to invite both President Karzai and the chair of the independent human rights commission , Dr
Sim@@ a Sam@@ ar , to Parliament with the prime purpose of our discussing with them the preparations for the elections and for the Lo@@ ja Jirga that is to produce a constitution
The clear message to a democratic Afghanistan must be that this constitution must , without reservations , give women 's rights a solid base
The subject of sexual violence is shrouded in strict social taboos
The Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities has taken up this issue on many occasions
It is unfortunate that there is still no banking system in Afghanistan , and this is another factor that continues to encourage corruption
Let us , then , set about improving the position of women , hoping for peace and stability in the region
Ladies and gentlemen , I wish to give a brief but warm welcome to the third year of the D
The main aim of this initiative is to promote the involvement of our younger citizens in the debate on the future of Europe
Mr President , I too have had the unique experience of visiting Afghanistan and seeing the situation with my own eyes
Mr Morillon and Mr Sakellariou said likewise
Women , of course , are still in a dire situation in all sectors
Bl@@ ue ghosts continue to w@@ af@@ t round the streets of Kabul , with few women daring to risk their lives by taking off their bur@@ ka
The Taliban may have lost power , but their spirit still ha@@ unts Afghanistan
In my opinion , there can be no economic or social progress as long as a culture of violence , religious fanaticism and misogyn@@ y reigns in Afghanistan
98 % of women are illiterate and economically dependent and 99 % give birth without medical assistance
This sort of soil provides an ideal breeding ground for extremist movements such as the Taliban
This fund could be used to finance new infrastructures to integrate women into public life
I also suggest , Commissioner , that we should invite President Karzai to Strasbourg to speak before a plenary session of the European Parliament
Mr President , there are so many worrying things on the international scene that ought to spur us to action that we no longer know which way to look
Let us not forget Afghanistan , which today is beginning to look like a caricature , a caricature of the US imperi@@ um
Since 11 September , the country has in fact been a caricature of a clear conscience
I say governor because Mr Karzai is clearly little more than a US governor
Mr President , I too would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten for what they have told us today
Let us not forget that we found a country ravaged by 23 years of war and years of drought
In this connection , I would like to urge Commissioner Patten not to abandon the aspect of specific personnel training , including for customs officers , which is fundamental
The European Union , which has done a great deal , must therefore persevere on these issues
We have set out a whole series of useful proposals
We have a history of respect for human rights for institutional , historic and cultural reasons
It is a tradition in Europe and we must respect it wherever necessary
We are still a long way from being able to say that the game in Afghanistan has been won
We are only a short way down the line and we still have a great deal to do over a very long period of time
Developments in Afghanistan will be influenced by numerous factors , both internal and external
Success will be measured by simultaneous progress on a number of political , institutional , social and economic fronts in Afghanistan
I will be very brief in responding to a debate which has ran@@ ged extremely wide
Mr Andrews ' contribution covered not only Afghanistan but Iraq
I would like to thank Members such as Mrs Fraisse who praised the work done by our officials in Kabul and beyond
They do have a difficult job
It is not the easiest assignment to manage our programme there
I will certainly pass on the commend@@ ation of Members
I would also like to express once again my agreement with Mr van Orden that we are in this for the long haul
There are no quick fi@@ xes in Afghanistan
We cannot simply call what we have done so far success and move on to the next failed state
So I can assure Mrs Fraisse that we shall continue to give proper attention to support and training for public services
We have , more than most other donors in Afghanistan , provided budgetary assistance for the ordinary business of government
It is not a very attractive , or sex@@ y thing for donors to do
Donors typically like to have projects and like to have blue pla@@ ques on walls and flags over buildings
So I continue to defend the priority that we give to that
One would have to be deaf not to recognise the concern the House has expressed about women 's rights as part of a general concern about human rights
I fully agree that development aid to Afghanistan must be used to maximum effect and that effective coordination is critical
The Afghan Government has now put in place the structures to coordinate donors
We strongly support this initiative
It should ensure that donors are well-@@ coordinated and that funds are targeted to the priorities agreed by the consultative group
Through ECHO , the Commission has had extensive experience of operating in Afghanistan over the last ten years and has established close working relationships with non-governmental organisations
So we are aware of these concerns
I have received six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure
These areas have been the subject of the most controversy , and , indeed , still are
Contro@@ versy continued to rage around the issue of whether a product that had been tested on animals could still be sold
That was one of the points on which this House made proposals at first and second reading
These proposals were what , in essence , our second reading was about
All of them gave rise to controversy
Although they passed through second reading by a very large majority , the Commission did not exactly welcome us with open arms
Today , though , at third reading , we can permit ourselves some self-congratul@@ ation , because the conciliation procedure was , I have to say , difficult
Over the years , I have had direct or indirect experience of many conciliation procedures
In this one , I started out uncertain as to whether we would achieve a compromise
The outcome is that a ban on testing cosmetics on animals will be in place - six years after the legislation is adopted
There will be a sales ban on most of the products still containing ingredients tested on animals - six years after the legislation is adopted
We have also said that there will be a derogation for three tests , the development of alternatives to which is not yet in sight
The cosmetics industry is not entirely bl@@ am@@ eless in this
That so little has been done to develop these tests is partly due to the cosmetics industry having been , in the past , what we might call do@@ zy
But we are now giving them an incentive , and a certain amount of time , to come up with alternatives
Let me make it clear that what we have achieved is a compromise , a compromise which , like all others , is not ideal
I am aware that the cosmetics industry finds it less than ideal , and also that the animal welfare organisations are convinced that more could have been achieved
Mr Liikanen , I wish it had done so a bit sooner , but at least it was never too late
I will also express my thanks to our colleagues in the Conciliation Committee , and to all those with whom we dealt during the conciliation procedure
This all adds up to one of the reasons why I love this Parliament so much , and why I would not wish to be a member of any other
It was a joy to work through the night with you until twenty past four in the morning
It was a joy to achieve this outcome and to have been allowed to be your rapporteur
Because the conciliation is about be concluded successfully , the Commission welcomes this agreement which provides a clear framework for tests on animals in the cosmetic sector
The solution found offers a genuine benefit to animal welfare whilst safeguarding consumer health protection and our international commitments
For the Commission , one of the key elements is the incentive to be given to the development of alternative methods , and the improvement of the validation process
On that subject , the European Union has to play a leading role in promoting the development of animal testing at international level
This will be done with due regard to the development of validation within the OECD
Let me point out , however , that many other important aspects are included
Firstly , the provisions aiming to improve health and consumer protection , in particular through more relevant information to consumers
All those aspects are clearly of benefit to the consumer
I genuinely believe that there are no losers in relation to this issue
Madam President , I should like to add my congratulations and conclude with a warning
I congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt , who has achieved so much over this long process
Perhaps if she had known at the outset the scale of the obstructions and difficulties , she would not have achieved so much
It helps sometimes to be a little ignorant of the difficulties
This proposal puts animal welfare above human van@@ ity , but never above human health
It sets time limits , graduated in accordance with the difficulties involved , and it sets new standards of reference which should and will be respected
To come to this final conclusion is an enormous satisfaction for all of us
My colleagues on the Conciliation Committee expressed the long frustrations of this process in that last marathon session
It was literally at the eleventh hour that we achieved the result that all desired
A new model strip carto@@ on has just been distributed to Members showing how exciting the work of the European Parliament is , with gl@@ am@@ orous young male and female characters
If there is another edition of this series , it should deal with the long night with Mrs Roth-Behrendt at the end of these proceedings
I also want to thank the Danish presidency
One often sees a presidency looking at a problem firmly in the eye , and then running away
The Danes knew that they could get a deal and they got it - through great skill in my opinion
This was a deal - I want to say this before going on to a word of warning - that meets Parliament 's principal concerns
It is a signal for action , and not an argument for delay
The animal welfare organisations which campaigned tirelessly for this outcome should not complain about the compromise that we achieved
The spotlight is now on compliance , with a provision to find alternative tests , especially in the most difficult areas of toxicity
None of us should make any apologies for how we came to be in this place today
We are today drawing a line that must not again be shifted
Animal welfare groups are unhappy with the outcome of the negotiations between Parliament and the Council , but I hope they recognise that real progress has been made
Mon@@ th after month , ministers told us that such a marketing ban would be contrary to WTO rules , but these objections were at last overcome during our midd@@ le-@@ of-@@ the-@@ night negotiations
There are practical steps now to be taken
In particular the authorisation procedures for new testing methods must be accelerated
Pres@@ sure to develop alternatives must now be put on the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries , which use the same tests
The cosmetics industry should recognise the strength of feeling in this Parliament
The agreement we reached has encountered criticism from many quarters
Animal protection organisations , in particular , have criticised it on the grounds that it will take too long to implement the ban
I agree with that criticism
I think we could have made faster progress
It is , however , important to criticise those who deserve criticism
The fact is that the body that should be criticised in this case is the EU Council of Ministers
Certain Member States , in particular , did everything to delay the ban
It is the European Parliament that should have the credit for the ban 's being introduced
The person who definitely deserves most praise in this context is our rapporteur , Mrs Roth-Behrendt
I should like to thank her for her brilliant efforts
Madam President , the prohibition of the use of carcinogenic substances in cosmetics in the future is a great success for this Parliament
We Greens have campaigned hard for this
So a great deal of gratitude is owed to Mrs Roth-Behrendt , particularly for this position , one that was of enormous importance to us
It is my belief that the Council at first attempted to wait for a risk assessment , in order thereby to leave carcinogenic substances on the market
Not only is it obvious and a matter of common sense that nobody wants carcinogenic substances in face cre@@ ams , but that is also the view of the Scientific Committee
Madam President , conciliation has brought a result which , in the end , satisfies no one
It is generally accepted that few alternative methods will be found within 10 years but that the total replacement of animal experiments might be possible within about 15 years
Madam President , my dear Dag@@ mar , I have to tell Mr Barnier that , when I came into the plenary , I was still in a good mood
No doubt it is my fault that I have been unaware of your existence in recent years
My dear Dag@@ mar , a veritable fan@@ fare of compliments has been sounded in your honour today
Every directive has , of course , its pros and cons
Today , industry will go away and take on young people - researchers , doctors , engineers - whose job will be to look for alternatives
That is precisely what management needs , and that is why this is the right way to go
Mr Liikanen , you know that , much as I respect you , your office sometimes puts forward we@@ aris@@ ome proposals
And stand firm you certainly will , for you know that the whole ser@@ ried ranks of this House are behind you
That means , I believe , that another solid success will be ours
Ladies and gentlemen , I have no need of three minutes
Europe and her people 's representatives have grasped that animals are to be valued in a different way
I cannot but go along with that , and we will do everything to ensure a respectable and credible reduction in the number of experiments on animals
The victory is yours , Mrs Roth-Behrendt - congratulations
Madam President , I want to begin by saying a big thank you to Mrs Roth-Behrendt for her skilful and very consistent work on the directive
I certainly also enjoyed working into the night with Dag@@ mar
It looked very difficult at the beginning
There were a number of Member States and also parts of industry that did everything to block decent rules concerning animal experiments
Thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt 's and others ' stubbornness , however , acceptable results were in actual fact achieved in two areas
The first of these was in relation to animal experiments
We are now to have bans imposed on animal experiments and on the marketing of new products developed by means of animal experiments
It might of course be said that both deadlines are too far in the future
It is now crucial that the Commission be consistent in following up the issue
I am able fully to endorse Mr Davies 's observation
Compliance with the current directives has not been sufficiently well monitored , and this has inflicted quite unnecessary suffering upon millions of animals used in experiments
There has most definitely been an acceptance of la@@ xity in developing alternative methods , and that la@@ xity must cease with this directive
The second major result concerned ourselves as consumers
First and foremost , we are obtaining a ban on the use of a range of carcinogenic substances and on the use of substances that impair our reproductive ability
Overall , this is a constructive outcome , and I would once again call upon the Commission to be consistent in following up this matter
I also believe that it is necessary for ourselves in Parliament to monitor such follow-up from the sidelines
Madam President , I would add my voice to those praising Mrs Roth-Behrendt
Thank you for your work , your efforts and the character you show
It only remains to observe that a compromise is a compromise
In spite of that , I am pleased that we nonetheless arrived at some sort of milestone , or something to grasp and hold on to
On the subject of animal protection , I should like to look ahead and broaden the debate a little
We keep seeing these appalling films of animal transportation and slaughter , revealing how we in Europe treat our animals
Imagine if Parliament had influence and the right of codecision on issues relating to agricultural policy
Imagine the situation , given the attitude and views on animal protection of an incredibly large majority in Parliament
Madam President , there were three goals that were important to the Greens
That has succe@@ e@@ ded; congratulations to Mrs Roth-Behrendt who negotiated so excellently
The second point , which was given less of a chance , relates to dangerous substances
D@@ ang@@ erous substances must not be allowed to be used in cosmetics
We also won on that point , so compliments are due to Mrs Roth-Behrendt in that regard too
Some cosmetics still contain allergens
There are already signs that quite a few big companies will be removing these allergens from their cosmetics
So we have also won on that point
I really cannot understand the criticism from the animal protection@@ ists
We have achieved the most we could achieve , and we commend the rapporteur and the whole negotiation delegation
Madam President , current policy whereby industry has been given time to develop alternative methods of experimentation has not produced results
It is essential to impose bans on experiments and marketing
Animals should not suffer through its being possible to develop new van@@ ity products
I should therefore like to congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the outcome of what will soon have been a long fight
Even if the conciliation text turned out not to be as restrictive as Parliament had wished , it contains the right principles
All substances , including those in category 3 , must be covered
Children too use products , such as sham@@ po@@ o and show@@ er so@@ ap , containing these substances , and no type of risk should be taken
The conciliation text is along the right lines , however , so I would once again congratulate you on your worthwhile struggle , Dag@@ mar
I remember the lively debates we have had in our Assembly , debates often full of emotion , whenever the question of animal welfare and public health has arisen
While it is right to want to restrict experiments on animals , we must never forget that our prime objective is to guarantee the health of our fellow citizens
We do not want to put the cosmetics industry in difficulties either , however , since it is an important part of our economy
The industry has been in the picture for a long time and has been able to plan the necessary investments for developing alternative methods
Our rapporteur has clearly explained that we have been discussing all this for at least 10 years
We should also stress the many efforts that have already been made and the encouraging results that have been obtained
But we cannot exactly take for granted the advances that science will make
Scientific results do not come to order , neither can they be programmed for a precise date , but they can be encouraged
It is in this spirit that I see the need to set cut-off dates with possible extensions for methods that today are still at the initial planning stage
Co@@ sme@@ tics have proved their safety
What is needed is for the information for the consumer to be made more accurate and relevant
Labelling must therefore be perfect and not have the opposite of the intended effect
For example , to take the example of various allergens , the information that has to be communicated must not frighten the consumer
It must be simple and enable them , if they are particularly sensitive to a product , to make the best choice
When viewed solely from the point of view of cosmetics , the outcome of the conciliation can be described as good
The industrial lobby has once again triumphed over the interests of animals who suffer unnecessarily
Europeans will only allow animal testing if it is absolutely necessary
This necessity does not apply to beauty products , so this directive should have implemented an unconditional ban on the sale and testing of these cosmetics
There is no such ban , however
The standpoint taken by our Parliament was already a compromise , but the outcome that has now been achieved makes things even worse
A partial prohibition will not enter into force until 2009 , and three tests will be allowed to continue until as late as 2013 and perhaps even after that
Better information for the consumer will hopefully result in consumers not wanting to become more beautiful by buying ' ugly ' cosmetics
It is of the greatest importance that governments , science and industry invest in alternative methods
This directive makes Europe look ugly , so I will not be supporting it
Madam President , we have been on a long journey
That is why the rapporteur has rightly received the pl@@ audits today because she has taken us along that road
When we hear the phrase ' long gestation periods ' we have tended hitherto to think of elephants
In future we will think of European legislation
It has been a long gestation period
We then had a long period in labour from 4 p
The Commission originally came forward with a proposal to end tests
It was right that we moved the debate on to the end of the marketing of products tested on animals within the European Union
We reminded ourselves , and we do so again , that on 1 July the sixth amendment came into force
Technically that would have brought any research using animals to a standstill
We looked beyond that and we see the seventh amendment as the last chance
It sets the target dates to end that marketing
Now the challenge is not only to the Commission , other colleagues have said that , but it is to the industry
It is up to the industry to accelerate that search for validated alternatives
The cooperation that exists already between Parliament and industry has been impressive
It has helped to convince firstly the Commission , and then even the minority on the Council which was reluctant to go along with this
This minority too came into line and that is why we are at the point we are today , in optimistic mode
Congratulations are in order for that
I am wholly in favour of it
After all , ladies and gentlemen , let us be honest , which of you would volunteer to be tested with new substances ?
The widespread criticism about this transitional period , which argues that permitting animal testing to continue is a loophole in the law , is therefore unjustified
As long as people do not volunteer for testing themselves , other ways of testing certain bulk products must be permitted
After all , these bulk products are also used in the pharmaceutical industry , and the standards we apply to medicines are naturally different from those we apply to lip@@ stick
I therefore wholeheartedly endorse this compromise
Such a grand@@ mother would be done for
You see , celebrated and truly beautiful women have for a long time used products made without experimentation on animals
Do American ac@@ t@@ resses really have to resort to European products simply because they are not tested on animals here ?
That at@@ tests to the inadequacy of the American cosmetics industry
I love cosmetics
I owe my hair colour to l' Or@@ é@@ al , my per@@ fu@@ me is by Di@@ or , and my face cream comes from Great Britain - Engl@@ ish@@ women have such wonderful comple@@ x@@ ions
In future , though , I will use far more cosmetics , and will be proposing Mrs Roth-Behrendt for hon@@ or@@ ary membership of all animal welfare organisations
Today , though , I really would like to thank Europe 's cosmetics industry most warmly for its cooperation , and I wish you a turnover of staggering dimensions
May these new products earn you masses and masses of money
Madam President , I must admit to being rather moved , for not even in this House is this amount of praise and appreciation to be reckoned with
I admit to enjoying it , for politicians do not often come in for praise , at any rate not with such frequency and regularity
It has made me feel good , but I have already tried to pass this praise back
Your mission is to drive industry on@@ ward , support it and , in tandem with it , to ensure that alternatives are developed quickly and equally quickly accepted
This is something we must do together
I would rather not hear anything further said on this subject in this House
Please let me conclude by again saying ' thank you ' - that is why I wanted to say a final word
Not to you , though , ladies and gentlemen , for I have thanked you already
Let me now - yes , this really is the end
I have no idea how the members of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy and I are supposed to work without her
Anyway , we will give it a try
She is here working on one of her bri@@ efs for the last time , and so my final and especial thanks must go to Mrs K@@ er@@ ry Post@@ le@@ white
Thank you for the debate , and I hope that the vote , which is about to take place , will go well
Thank you , rapporteur
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 12 noon
The sitting is suspended until 12 noon
( The sitting was suspended 11
and resumed at 12 noon )
The next item is the vote
Mo@@ tion for a resolution tabled by Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe Di Lello Finuoli , on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group , on immigration and asylum policy
Mr President , I rise on a brief point of order
Mr President , our voting list does not seem to be following the same order as yours
That may be our problem rather than yours , but could we just take a moment to clarify ?
We did not have Amendment 6 or Amendment 30 , so we are a bit lost at the moment
Could my colleagues help me here ?
I think we have lost the page
We have lost a whole page
The Liberals have been saying that for a hundred years
Mr President , I would simply like to point out a translation error in the French version
I have checked in the other versions
This leads me to say to my PPE-DE friends that we should vote for this amendment and , of course , correct the French version
We will ensure that all language versions are compatible
It is my pleasure to welcome to the public gallery representatives of the Egyptian Parliament , led by Dr Mu@@ staf@@ a E@@ l-@@ Fe@@ ki
This is the first visit by representatives from the Egyptian Parliament since 1987
It occurs at a very important time , in terms of the Middle East
We particularly wish the delegation success under the current circumstances
Mr President , the oral amendment consists of a social measure
This is also in honour of the International Year of Mountains and the many mountains we have in Europe
Mr President , I nevertheless deplore the way in which this vote has proceeded
I regret that our colleagues were not serious to the end and showed no respect for the efforts of our fellow Members who worked on this resolution
That concludes the vote
The European Parliament is clearly showing here whose side it is on
We are against the EU 's having influence in this area , since it should be up to the Member States themselves to decide on these matters
From sustainable development to sustainable development , the gap between the plundering imperialist countries and the poor countries never ceases to grow
Our answer to the refrain repeated by most resolutions on ' preventing illegal immigration ' is the need to regularise the situation of all so-called illegal immigrants
British Conservatives have consistently opposed a Common Asylum and Immigration Policy and believe that these policies should be determined by Member States
The British Conservatives will therefore vote against this resolution
The proposal contains quite a number of useful features for improving immigration and asylum policy in the EU
We are nonetheless aware of the fact that this area includes states of affairs covered by Title IV of the EC Treaty and not relevant to Denmark , cf
We must improve the welcome we give to refugees so that potential immigrants are no longer tempted to use illegal means
We therefore call for a speedy and effective implementation of the conclusions of Seville and we regret that a common immigration policy has not yet been put in place
We must respond quickly because we cannot close our eyes to the dram@@ as currently being played out in our Member States
Mr President , it was with great pleasure that I voted for the report against the experimentation of cosmetics on animals , tabled by Mrs Dag@@ mar Roth-Behrendt
Why did I vote for the report ?
another important achievement which I hope will come about soon
In the meantime , we have obtained what I voted for , contained in the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee in the Roth-Behrendt report
In fact , I think the concomit@@ ance of these two bans is the only really effective way of stimulating the development of alternative methods of experimentation
The European Parliament has fought for the Directive on Co@@ sme@@ tics to be extended and deepened , especially in the field of testing on animals
I welcome the fact that , in the conciliation process , both the Council and the Commission moved towards the position maintained by the European Parliament
In Italy , we still have a law which does not grant a disability pension to elderly citizens , whereas it does grant it to its younger citizens
Mr President , today , a for@@ tu@@ itous left-wing majority of five votes has done damage to the cause of human rights
In my view , the cause of human rights is too important for a community founded on law and human rights to allow that to be done to it
That is why I voted against this report
There will now be an institutional deadlock , because neither the Commission nor the Council - they have already announced this - are willing to accept this trend
We have missed an opportunity to be clearer and more coherent
The British Labour members and I have voted in favour of the S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel report , which as a whole serves a valuable purpose
All Member States must , by their very nature , be strong and confident enough to accept criticism
This does not automatically mean that every criticism should be accepted as valid
The report is based on second-hand information from NGOs and other organisations
A number of factual inaccuracies have therefore crept in
The UK takes very seriously all allegations of violence and racism by public servants
Any allegations are rigorously investigated and prosecutions sought
The detention of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism is a very serious matter
However , exceptional measures are sometimes necessary to deal with potential threats to national security
The 1951 Geneva Convention was surely never intended to give protection to terror@@ ist@@ s; it is therefore right that they should be excluded
Whilst not perfect , UK legislation seeks to promote the rights of workers and encourages employers to treat employees with due consideration at all times
They also have access to legal redress if appropriate
So we have reservations about the accuracy of the report but we welcome it and have voted in favour
? he motion on fundamental rights in the European Union is , generally speaking , a good motion
However , there are several problem paragraphs , such as paragraph 78 on the ban on women entering Moun@@ t Ath@@ os
Soon we will be calling for freedom of establishment and freedom of business activity and the monasteries will be overrun with Coc@@ a-@@ Col@@ a stands
It is because of paragraph 78 that I am forced to vote against the report as a whole
We are against using the expression , ' forced prostitution '
Our view is that prostitution is always forced
Behind prostitution , there is always compul@@ sion , dependency and exploitation
There can be no talk of voluntary prostitution and therefore no talk of forced prostitution either
We believe that Sweden should sign ILO Convention No 169 on indigenous and tribal peoples
Signing up to the convention requires adjustments to Swedish law , however
For example , the extent of the land that the L@@ ap@@ ps have traditionally used or been in possession of has to be clearly identified
The inquiry must be completed by the end of 2004 and will then have to be referred for consultation
It means that it will be some years before Swedish ratification is possible
We wish to make it clear that the Swedish Government responded to the criticism and set up an inquiry that was completed last year
The inquiry was conducted expressly from the point of view of citizens ' rights and is critical of a variety of aspects of the criminal inquiry
Human rights are the most important foundation stone of European cooperation
It is self-evident that we should make just as tough demands upon our own countries as upon the candidate countries and other non-EU countries
It is , however , unfortunate that the report does not simply focus upon fundamental rights but also expresses certain political aspirations
Irrespective of whether or not one shares these political visions , this method is in danger of de@@ valuing the importance of fundamental rights
That is why we cannot vote for the report in its entirety
We are also voting against item 43 , because it is wrongly worded
Naturally , the principle that it should not be possible to convic@@ t someone twice for the same crime is fundamental
That does not , however , mean that imprisonment and deportation should be excluded as punishments for serious crimes
I am deeply concerned to read the many criticisms of the United Kingdom in this report
For myself , I felt obliged to vote against the report
' Things can only get better '
Moreover , respect for human rights must be , and remain , its indispensable point of departure
On principle , we do not however believe that this is best achieved by developing a common European refugee policy based on the supranational first pillar
The June Movement is also voting in favour of the whole report , because human rights within the EU must naturally be respected , if not improved
The June Movement endeavours to support and improve the human rights situation both within and outside the EU
We support the right of everyone to a life of dignity , but we do not believe that this is necessarily best achieved within the framework of the EU
And we do not want our votes to be associated , either directly or indirectly , with those people 's votes
The Member States and the EU have got into the habit of giving lessons in democracy and defence of human rights all over the world
This generally accompanies demands for freedom of the market and competition
Reading the S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel report , you would think the Member States also needed to put their houses in order
The report does in fact reveal many violations of human rights in the EU
No country is spared
I and my group are glad that the majority of our Assembly has adopted the report , which was further enriched by the adoption of my group 's amendments
The report both criticises and praises the human rights situation in Portugal , in a way that we feel is accurate and balanced
we therefore were unable to vote for this report
This was an opportunity for Parliament to gain control over the Member States
Nothing but the Charter , in other words , the articles as they are and not as one might like them to be
This report will not affect the Charter at all , since only a new Convention has the power to change its articles
Moreover , it is completely pointless to over@@ state the situation
This report could have been awaited by the press and feared by the Member States
Having failed to achieve a unanimous vote , however , it will be buried alongside other pointless reports
Citi@@ zenship is inextricably linked to participation in the political life of a Member State
It is the sign of belonging to a particular group , not only in a strictly legal sense , but also on a very practical level
The right to vote at local level is one way of participating
Third country nationals can already participate in many ways in local life within the European Union
Gran@@ ting them the right to vote at local level means recognising an additional right , but this recognition is not without its associated duties
Citi@@ zenship must be defined by certain civic behaviour as much as by active and daily participation in society
We think the report is very good and are therefore voting in favour of it
These recommendations will protect social rights - particularly by making optimal use of the revised European Social Charter and the ILO conventions - and access to justice
The P@@ A@@ SO@@ K political group 's vote on the motion in Mrs Jo@@ ke S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel 's report is a clear vote against , as far as Greece is concerned
We are urged to abolish the death penalty
a ) the death penalty has been abolished , except in the military penal code , and then only for crimes in times of war;
b ) the bill to abolish the death penalty in the military penal code has already been draf@@ ted;
c ) no death penalty imposed is ever carried out
a ) the new arrangements allowing exemption from military service are now included in a constitutional decre@@ e;
b ) Greek legislation no longer limits these favourable arrangements to religious objec@@ tion; they now extend to conscientious objection in general
British Conservatives believe that this report is an outrageous intrusion into the domestic affairs of the UK and other Member States
The unwarranted attacks on valuable public servants such as policemen and prison guards are completely unacceptable and cannot be substantiated
The reality is that we live in a dangerous world in which our liberty is threatened by terrorists , dictators and violent crimes
The British public is entitled to expect its elected representatives to defend and protect it , not to leave it vulnerable in these vital areas
The report shows the European union in a very bad light
In her report M@@ iss S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel expresses her own personal views on human rights
Apart from the usual list , the report proposed today once again joins in the obsession of the pro-@@ immigration , human@@ -@@ rights , liberal , anti-@@ national , coloni@@ alist lobbies
The rapporteur considers this ban to be counter to the principle of non-discrimination and gender equality
When will monasteries and conven@@ ts be forced to be mixed ?
Anyone establishing fundamental rights in the European Union must know whether these rights are being observed seriously by the governments concerned
It is to Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel 's credit that she has documented so well how much is wrong in Europe in the area of human rights
She correctly focuses attention on police misconduct , abuses in prisons , discrimination against ethnic minorities , failings in criminal proceedings and the vesti@@ ges of inequalities between men and women
EU Member States are apparently failing to ratify international treaties on national minorities , cross-border television , the revised European Social Charter and the status of adopted or illegitimate children
Min@@ ors are being used as child soldiers
Exc@@ es@@ sively authoritarian security measures that are now being justified with reference to the current threat of terrorism are threatening to become permanent
We are very much in need of this inventory so that we can put an end to abuses more effectively
Evidently there is a large minority in this Parliament that does not want to tackle the existing violations of fundamental rights
I cannot remember ever , in all my years as a parliamentarian , seeing as abhorrent a text as that presented to us today by Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel
Aside from this aspect , however , which is in itself unacceptable on principle , the main cause for indignation is the instru@@ ment@@ alisation of the Charter against the Member States
The legitimate fight for respect for human rights must not be confused with unhealthy fan@@ ta@@ sies to the detriment of the common good
This report is truly a comp@@ act version of the most sickening aspects of the ideology of human@@ -@@ rights activists
There is nothing like a good political fight
From the democratic point of view , I congratulate Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel on her ultimate success
This does no favours , either for Europe or for human rights
I have voted against the report
The report reflects options selected on a party political basis and mis@@ uses the concept of human rights
In this way , the concept of human rights is diluted , watered down and devalued , which is pretty serious
I would like to congratulate Mrs S@@ wi@@ e@@ bel on her outstanding work
As the European Union , we have to set an example , otherwise our credibility with third countries will be in jeopardy
As the chairman of the Intergroup for Regional and Minority Languages , I would like to emphasise how important the use of regional and minority languages is to people
Language forms part of our personal and cultural identity and is thus one of our fundamental rights
It is the most important means of communication between people
Encouraging the use of minority languages reinforces social cohesion at regional level
I have therefore voted in favour of paragraphs 66 and 68
It is the first step
According to Article 149 of the Treaty on European Union , the European Union 's task is to support linguistic diversity
we urgently need a legal basis for regional and minority languages in the Treaty
I believe this would get us on the right track
Crime is organised internationally , and we have to , at long last , organise the combating of crime on a Community and cross-border basis
The European Parliament 's Pirker report is more along these lines , and we also agree , as we have already said at the Seville European Council in June 2002
This ' supranation@@ alisation ' of external border control would in fact be highly counterproductive , as it would take responsibility away from the Member States
It is vital for each Member State to remain in control of its borders
This would be a useful outlet for European solidarity
Naturally , we voted against this report
We can only approve the establishment of coordination between the Member States over external border control
ensure mutual trust between the Member States with regard to border control ,
combat all kinds of internal and external threats created by terrorism and
Nobody can deny that the right to security is a fundamental right
We must all be aware , however , that we cannot sacrifice the other fundamental rights in order to achieve it
The proposal includes quite a few useful features , but we do not believe that the time is ripe for setting up a joint Corps of Border Gu@@ ards
Schengen cooperation has enabled people to travel more freely in the Member States without having to show their passports at the internal borders
Obviously , such a reform requires more effective pat@@ rolling of the shared external borders
We are , however , doubtful about the idea of an EU-@@ financed Corps of Border Gu@@ ards
The national police forces ' monopoly on crime fighting and border pat@@ ro@@ ls within the territories of the Member States is fundamental and should be retained
Police from other countries should not have the power to act in other Member States except under very special circumstances , as is also stated in the Schengen Convention
As far as possible , these rules should also apply to border controls
Individual Member States ' provisions and traditions when it comes to police work , especially procedures relating to ID checks and arrests , differ from one another in many respects
With a joint Corps of Border Gu@@ ards , there might be a danger of these provisions ' not being fully respected
I would also stress my conviction that the efficiency of border management will probably be improved by the adoption of common measures in the field of external border management
Europe has abolished internal borders
As well as the common market , we have the great Schengen agreement
This door@@ man at the external borders , however , is not doing his job
Security is no longer guaranteed
In this case , a bord@@ er-@@ control corps , just as others want coast@@ guards
There is even the traditional European agency to heal all wo@@ es going by the name of S@@ CI@@ FA + , a body responsible for coordinating border protection
In the meantime , the external borders are like le@@ ak@@ y si@@ eves , letting everything through
Which at the end of the day is the only effective solution
The remarkable thing is that nobody is openly advocating a superstate such as this
Specifically when it comes to everything to do with foreign affairs and defence , we try to show that the EU still consists of 15 sovereign states
I therefore reject this proposal
Its activities would involve , in particular , the inspection of documents , the questioning of foreign citizens and the notification of admission or refusal of entry into our territory
Clearly , a European police corps of this nature raises questions , primarily with regard to its questionable and highly dubious effectiveness
Essentially , however , and as affirmed in the Commission Communication , it would pose delicate constitutional problems in various Member States
I voted in favour of this report for the following reasons , which are quite brief
Mr President , many pensioners purchase securities in an attempt to be better off in their later life
Even from the perspective of the operation of the financial markets and the capitalist economy , the national fragmentation of the European Union is a handicap
Its entire history over past decades shows that it can only be overcome with great effort and difficulty
In financial terms , you would like to emulate the system currently in use in the United States
In order to create this system , however , we would need to apply restrictive regulatory measures to the Member States , which they refuse to accept
We are for the enlargement of public services that are of use to the people
We could not care less , however , about the state of mind of finan@@ ci@@ ers facing problems due to the very nature of their own system
By all means , try to solve your own problems , but , since they do not concern us , we abstained from this vote
This is something with which we disagree
Nowadays , a surgeon in Rome can operate on an ill patient - usually an elderly patient - in Finland or Belgium and vice versa
The issue of health care and care for the elderly is an important one and of concern to us all
The report is thoughtful and well-considered
I would underline the point made early in the report that the provision of health and health care services is a Member State competence
It is important that this should continue to be the case
But all Member States can learn from each other , and in particular they need to learn in the key areas covered by this report
I was pleased that my amendments were accepted by the rapporteur as well as the full House today
The specific needs of the elderly regarding health care need much more attention , especially in rural areas
In my own country , projections are that more and more elderly people are moving to rural areas to retire
They put down roots in such communities
This is a challenge , but it is a challenge which must be met
We have our reservations about the content of Mr Mantovani 's report
We support the amendment by the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , advocating a method of cooperation instead of the open coordination method
We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity , whereby decisions are to be made as close as possible to those they affect
It needs to be clear to everyone that the EU must only deal with those issues it is best placed to deal with , namely cross-border issues
All other issues should be dealt with at local , regional or national levels
Health care and care for the elderly are examples of areas in which the EU should only have limited competence
Health care and care for the elderly are issues that have traditionally occupied prominent places on our Liberal agenda
The questions are financial
The questions are also professional
Where are the specialists in ger@@ i@@ at@@ ric@@ s , the care@@ rs , the specialist care centres , the training required for this segment of the population ?
Without the input of community money , people who are old , sick or unemployed will not be able to exist
We would have no decent healthcare for the vast majority of people , no education , no public transport , no environmental protection and no services for the aged
The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs wants a combination of best practices , access , high quality and accessibility
It makes little sense to formulate such nice objectives without providing sufficient resources to enable these objectives to actually be achieved
By constantly striving to cut taxes , we make it impossible to provide good services and the solidarity required for these
People constantly maintain that the cost of services can be cut without compromising on quality
At the end of the day , this report is based on a model such as this
As it is ultimately the weakest who pay , I reject this model
As a result of the Member States ' policies , the EU is benefiting from clearly exceptional health systems compared to the rest of the world
Against this backdrop , the proposals contained in the Commission Communication are of strategic importance to guaranteeing accessibility , quality and financial viability with regard to healthcare for the elderly
Instead , the sharing of experiences and solutions could help to achieve the social cohesion that we wish to see
Life expectancy has almost doubled in the last fifty years , which has created a completely different world
' I have been and am in the United Arab Em@@ ir@@ ates controlling air traffic from Italy to Afghanistan
I am very happy and proud of what I am doing , and it is very satisfying
This is not war; it is about bringing peace and building on it where there is need '
This is why I voted , even more enthusiastically , for this report on Afghanistan
We Swedish Social Democrats present the following explanation of vote
We support the resolution but wish to point out that it makes no mention of women or their human rights
Nor does it mention women 's priorities , supported by Parliament in December 2001 , but , rather , those of the Afghan Government
We believe there needs to be a requirement for all aid projects to be informed by the dimension of equality and for women to be represented in the government
Women were victims under both the Northern Alliance and the Taliban
Women are the most important actors in the cause of peace
A policy for Afghanistan must be a policy also aimed at the majority of the Afghan people , namely women and children
The United States , with the support of European Member States , has spent vast sums on flooding the country with bombs
There is no question , however , of the world powers spending even a fraction of these sums on improving the life of the people
The various resolutions themselves reflect a ro@@ se-@@ tinted view of the disastrous situation in Afghanistan
As always , however , we are content to welcome , request and invite
That concludes the explanations of vote

The post of Ombudsman is a crucial post for European democracy
It is important that it is in competent hands and we now see that it will be
One point I would like to make is this
I offer Professor Di@@ am@@ and@@ ou@@ ro@@ s all my congratulations
I should like to thank you , along with the other candidates , for offering us the vitality of democratic choice
Mr President , as President-in-Office , may I offer the European Parliament my warmest congratulations on its selection
I know that the candidates , especially those remaining in the final round , were both highly qualified and extremely able
I would like to congratulate him and , at the same time , say how sorry I am that Greece will be losing him for a while
He is so valuable that this will be a real loss to us
It is a great day for him and a great day for Greece , though I recognise Europe 's gain is Greece 's loss
I would also like to pay a tribute to the work done by Mr Söderman over the last few years
We wish him the best on this journey and we assure him that on this occasion , arriving and landing in I@@ th@@ aca is even more exciting than travelling there
All our best wishes go to the Professor who I am sure will do this job out@@ stand@@ ingly well
? he Minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed
Mr President , on behalf of myself and my fellow MEPs , I wish to thank Mr Perry for having been a good candidate in this election
As you observed , Mr Perry is one of the foremost champions of good administration
We must also be grateful that we had a good supply of professional candidates
just over half an hour ago , the Finnish press agency sent a text message about the outcome of the election
Your comments have been noted
This is a mistake
The final version should reflect the fact that I abstained on that report
I can assure you that Parliament 's services have already taken note of it and will correct the Minutes accordingly
Let us be Mediterranean partners for peace
It is my hope , and I am sure the whole of Parliament agrees with me , that the exception of Syria will be resolved as soon as possible
With regard to this agreement , I would like to comment on certain issues which have been raised during the debate in committee
I would like to support and acknowledge the efforts the Lebanese authorities are making in the fight against terrorism , particularly in application of United Nations Resolution 1373
Within this context , the issue of respect for human rights and democratic principles is essential to this Parliament
Mr President , we are very keen to make the conclusion and adoption of this Agreement dependent on the quest for solutions as to how this area can be stabilised
Lebanon , which was once known as the ' Switzerland of the Middle East ' , has for many years sustained great blows , both internally and externally
Ladies and gentlemen , we see the position of the Palestinian refugees as being a most particularly serious problem
We have to be clear in our own minds about how great a burden they are on Lebanon
There are also many other associated problems
These communities are represented at institutional level
The Council is closely monitoring internal political dialogue in Lebanon
The first step was the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May 2000 , followed by a partial withdrawal of the Leban@@ ese-@@ Syrian army in June 2001
At the same time , there is a risk that the presence of He@@ zbollah forces in the south of the country will become a destabilising factor in Israeli-@@ Lebanese relations
Implementation of the action plan adopted by the European Council in September 2001 is progressing well
As far as its foreign dimension is concerned , the Council has decided to include the fight against terrorism in the agreement between the European Union and third countries
As far as respect for human rights is concerned , the Council is monitoring this issue closely
The Council expressed its concern about action by the Lebanese army against Christian activists in August 2001 and about the closure of the independent television station ? ? F last September
The Association Agreement will also strengthen the potential for monitoring this issue and will encourage the authorities in Lebanon to have greater respect for human rights
As you know , the agreement requires respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be a basic element in both sides ' domestic and foreign policy
In addition , regular political dialogue will be established at various levels , mainly in the Association Agreement , on all matters of interest
The signing of the Association Agreement is an important development and marks the start of a new chapter in our relations with Lebanon
Although it refers mainly to intergovernmental relations , the agreement also offers an operational framework for the business community and civil society
This agreement is vital to the European Union 's entire Mediterranean policy and is yet another step towards the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade zone
I should point out that Lebanon has just ratified both the Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement which comes into force on 1 March 2003
Good communications channels between politicians on both sides of the Mediterranean are an important factor in building constructive relations between the ? U and its Mediterranean partners
At bilateral level , the Association Agreement makes provision for an EU-@@ Lebanon Association Council , to facilitate cooperation and contacts between the European Parliament and parliamentary institutions in Lebanon
The Members of Parliament involved will have to set the framework for this dialogue which , as far as the Council is concerned , will supplement Euro-Mediterranean dialogue in general
We are currently examining cooperation mechanisms in order to create a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly
The European Parliament has started working on just such an assembly , which will include members of the 27 national parliaments and the European Parliament
The Euro-Mediterranean summit in Valencia proposed strengthening the parliamentary dimension of Euro-Mediterranean dialogue by creating a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly
For their part , the senior officials responsible for the Barcelona process also agreed to set up a group to coordinate with the Bar@@ i working party
One of the objectives of the Greek Presidency is to use the dynamics of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in order to strengthen its parliamentary dimension
Mr President , the House is considering today a very important resolution on the adoption of the Association Agreement signed with Lebanon in June last year
Lebanon is a key partner in the Euro-Mediterranean structure
Parliament has before it , in my judgment , the means to provide Lebanon with a firm foundation for building its future
The country has experienced a terrible civil war
It has been the victim of outside interference , it still remains vulnerable
There is broad support in Lebanon for this new strengthened relationship with Europe
The Lebanese Parliament ratified both the Association Agreement and the Interim Agreement in December
The interim agreement allows both sides to start the 12@@ -year transition period from March 2003 , leading to the gradual introduction of free trade
The free-trade area will bring about profound changes to Lebanese commerce
Lebanon is rightly pri@@ zed for the entrepreneurial skills of its work force
Its economic strategy is already liberal
World Trade Organisation membership has been requested
The opening of markets and economies will bring benefits through economic liberalisation and increased competitiveness
Lebanon will benefit immediately from market access for its agricultural and processed agricultural products
And the Union will gain from improved access to service sector industries in Lebanon , once these arrangements have been concluded
Of the 18 governments participating , six were Member States and the Commission was also represented at its highest level
There is a clear interest in seeing that Lebanon wea@@ thers the economic storm of post-war recovery , and reduces its debt
The amount pledged to assist in debt relief matched expectations ( about $ 4
But , the Association Agreement is first and foremost a political agreement , which is why it devotes so much importance to political dialogue
The Agreement is a potent expression of shared values and common objectives
It is through dialogue that members of this partnership can pursue the shared commitment to achieving peace in the Middle East
We are , however , conscious of the concerns expressed by the Parliament 's Foreign Affairs Committee on specific points of the human rights situation in Lebanon
The agreement provides an additional forum for tackling these concerns
And I know too the concerns which have been expressed about freedom of the media
I can reassure you that the Commission will continue to monitor and follow these concerns wherever and whenever possible
Social and cultural cooperation is also central to the Agreement , in terms of rights of workers , and social dialogue
Our partnership will be sustained by contributions under the MEDA programme which I hope will be focused , as far as possible , on implementation of the Agreement
I commend this agreement most warmly to Parliament
I have not forgotten this ' Balk@@ anisation ' of Lebanese territory , which was as destructive as the ' Leban@@ on@@ isation ' of the former Yugoslavia was later to be
I am sure it will be adopted tomorrow , by a strong majority of Parliament , following the proposal of Mr Galeote
The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly asked for them to be withdrawn
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you told us that a first step had been taken by withdrawing some of these troops
In my eyes , that is not enough
Mr President , Mr Y@@ iann@@ it@@ sis , Mr Patten , the EU-@@ Lebanon Association Agreement marks a step forward in our long-standing relations
It is precisely for this reason that the article in the Agreement which refers to human rights must be taken seriously by the Lebanese authorities and the European institutions
We are pleased to note that Lebanon has signed the International Convention on Women 's Rights and the Convention against Torture
This process should be supported by the MEDA programme , with clear support for the autonomous development of civil society
Another crucial issue is an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and pacification of the region , where a lasting solution can only be found by creating a Palestinian state
The Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon was an extremely important event , but peace was not a consequence
Lastly , we hope that the Agreement will support economic reforms and trade , which were already important issues
We must now redefine the enlarged Union 's external relations and we must give Europe a more significant role in the world
The Partnership , launched in Barcelona in 1995 , was created with 12 countries
We now have a broader , more systematic view of this process which encompasses the Mediterranean , the Balkans and the Gulf states
I would therefore urge us to go further than the - albeit important - decisions of the last Inter@@ ministerial Conference in Valencia
This change could be truly significant , and to be a success it must take into account the remarks already made on the geopolitical dimension and policies
The most important thing is for it to have instruments in order to make real progress in the field of rights , democracy and freedom
Mr President , quite a few problems affecting Lebanon have been mentioned in this Chamber , in spite of there also being many positive signs in that country
We in the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party wish to highlight a number of these problems
There are extensive infringements of human rights
These refugees too must come to enjoy the positive advantages that the association agreement can provide
The ELDR Group has tabled a number of amendments concerning , for example , the 200 Lebanese held prisoner in Syria
There are also a dozen in Israel
The situation concerning these refugees must be clarified
Lebanon must also ratify the Geneva Convention
We are very concerned about the situation of the refugees
Trade and the exchange of goods are nonetheless to be welcomed
In the long term , they promote democracy and development - political , economic and social
The association agreements are also an important part of the Barcelona Process
We are therefore voting in favour of this association agreement in the hope that it will lead to development in Lebanon
We nonetheless feel a certain hesitation in doing so because Lebanon is far from being a democracy , and there are flagrant breaches of human rights
These clauses are nothing other than a resounding shot in the dark
This must take place through a dialogue between equals
It is even more urgent as the risk of war in Iraq weighs upon relations with the Arab world as a whole
Next , as has already been said , we need to use all available means to escape the spiral of violence in the Middle East
I am thinking in particular of the serious basis constituted by the offer of peace adopted by the Arab countries in Be@@ ir@@ ut
This is especially true in southern Lebanon , where problems of borders with Israel have not been solved
for example , rehabilitation of infrastructures , rebuilding homes and irrigation projects
although it does not explain everything , it probably prevents the Lebanese from effectively er@@ asing all the scars of war
This is also true of the situation of Palestinian refugees
The right to return should be recognised as legitimate , but the discrimination that actually affects Palestinian refugees in Lebanon is unjustifiable
Access to work or social protection should be guaranteed more effectively , with our help
Lastly , we cannot ignore the social and economic aspects
While the period immediately following the war required the implementation of an ambitious reconstruction programme , the current situation is bleak
Some would say that the Lebanese economy is somewhere between the developing world and the City
The debt is USD 30 billion
There is glaring inequality
The high consumption of the wealthy goes side by side with raging poverty , intensified by an extremely high cost of living and widespread low income
The Lebanese Prime Minister did obtain aid of over EUR 4 billion in Paris last November from some European and Arab countries as well as from international financial institutions
I remain more than sceptical , however , as to the positive effects of creating a free-trade zone
The loss of customs taxes could have significant consequences for useful public spending
European aid should therefore be given through active support for the organisations operating in humanitarian and social fields
I still think that modernity and social progress consist of making the focus of Euro-Mediterranean relations human factors rather than goods and capital
we should heed the critics
All the organisations fighting for democracy in this country , however , support the idea of this association agreement
We would also like the Commission and the Council to ask Syria and Israel officially for information on Lebanese nationals who are being held in these states
I believe the European institutions can help to shed light on this matter , which weighs heavily on relations within the region
The Verts/ALE Group in the European Parliament would also like to draw the attention of the House to the pressure exerted on the Lebanese press
We call for strict respect for the freedom of the press , in all its forms , moreover , in particular for journalists or other media that criticise government policy
We call for this country to respect the right of the opposition , which we all know receives extremely poor treatment
Once again , ladies and gentlemen , this association agreement constitutes a challenge , which we must meet
it is Nordic , Mediterranean , and Atlan@@ tic@@ ; it is also ultra@@ peripheral and certainly continental
With the conclusion of an Association Agreement with the Republic of Lebanon , the EU is putting its own political credibility on the line , both internally and externally
As recently as at the last European Council , the Council of Copenhagen , the Council again acknowledged Israel 's legitimate concerns about her security
The Council also committed itself to the fight against international terrorism
The two central points of the foreign policy of EU Member States are not compatible with the power base that He@@ zbollah is forming in Lebanese politics
It is not for nothing that Southern Lebanon is known as ' He@@ zbol@@ la@@ h@@ land ' these days
The party of Al@@ lah has been lor@@ d and master ever since Israel 's military withdrawal from the border area in May 2000
This Shi@@ ite terror organisation has built up an impressive military presence thanks to the combined cooperation of Syria and Iran
Including a large arsenal of missiles within range of the whole of the north of the Jewish state
All within easy reach of Lebanese Islam@@ ic@@ ists who un@@ remit@@ tingly and openly advocate the physical destruction of Israel
This European unease will not upset He@@ zbollah
The party of Al@@ lah is simply not mentioned
How does the Council view that ?
I would like to ask the Greek Presidency what steps it intends to take against He@@ zbollah in Be@@ ir@@ ut , Dam@@ as@@ c@@ us and Teheran
Diplom@@ atic inactivity gives the EU absolutely no credibility as a peace broker in the Middle East
the intifada in Palestine now forms their front line
Only these measures will have the effect of stabilising the whole region and promoting peace in it , as they simultaneously send a signal to the destabilising regimes
A powerful stance such as this would also set the right tone for the negotiations on the EU 's future relationship with Dam@@ as@@ c@@ us and Teheran
Otherwise the European institutions would only be paying lip service to the bare fact of Israel 's existence and the global fight against terrorism
What makes me even more resolute in my stance is that the European institutions are demanding virtually no genuine guarantees from Be@@ ir@@ ut regarding the observance of human rights
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I have just returned from Lebanon where I went before Christmas with Jean-@@ Marie Le Pen
We were made as welcome by the Lebanese press as by such well-known figures as the Mar@@ on@@ ite patri@@ ar@@ ch Mon@@ sign@@ or S@@ fe@@ ir , or the former Head of State Mr Am@@ in G@@ em@@ a@@ ye@@ l
It should encourage us to consider the dangers of removing borders when , in Lebanon , the refugees have begun to speak as if they were running the country
We can only deal , however , with a sovereign State , a peaceful , honest and impartial State
A peaceful State means an end to the repression , also mentioned by other speakers , practised against students , political dissidents , and Christians in particular
That means that certain post-war procedures or processes , which could legitimately be described as Stal@@ in@@ ist , should ceas@@ e; that the general amnesty should be extended to all
Lastly , an honest , impartial State means an end to the political racketeering that results all too often from reconstruction in this country ravaged by war
These are the three conditions for the agreement that we want with all our hearts to reach optimum effectiveness
On my most recent visit there I was encouraged to see that those three great traditions are reas@@ ser@@ ting themselves in the rebuilding of that country
It is , as the Commissioner has said , undergoing this process of rebuilding in possibly the most difficult times , especially from the economic point of view
They have survived the past in an extraordinary fashion and remained civilised and pe@@ ren@@ ni@@ ally ch@@ arming
It is very important that we maintain the closest links , as the previous speaker mentioned
The fran@@ c@@ oph@@ one connection is only one of many which we have between the members of the European Union and the rest of the Middle East
The Lebanon is a focal point from which we can operate and through which we can operate
We can do so much by example that it is important for this House to maintain these links
Finally , I would point out that it was always through the Lebanon that many of the contacts were made with the other Middle Eastern countries
Lebanon is a State whose independence still poses problems today
That is the paradox we face today
Is there a need for an association ?
An association , Mr President , can only exist between two parties
Does the European Union currently have a fully credible partner ?
Unfortunately that is still in doubt
the inter@@ tw@@ ining of cultures and religions , rooted in the country but different from each other
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Lebanese civil society is following closely the signature of this association agreement
The confirmation of this decision by the courts only serves to increase concerns over this situation
The de@@ regulations of the legal system do not encourage respect for freedom of expression as the courts are increasingly instru@@ ment@@ alised in order to act as means of applying pressure
More than 17 000 people have disappeared since the beginning of the Lebanese war
Ten years after the end of the conflict , no serious enquiry has been carried out to discover what happened to them
Some were probably executed in Lebanon , but no search has been undertaken for the bodies
It also seems that the victims of kidnapping were handed over to Syria and then transferred to Syrian prisons
The association of families was recently received by the Syrian authorities , who promised them an enquiry but have done nothing as yet
The Lebanese authorities , for their part , remain silent
Public opinion is increasingly calling for the total withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon
Their presence , in addition to corruption within the Lebanese political class , contributes to maintaining a climate of instability dominated by a catastrophic economic situation
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , may I take this opportunity of welcoming you to this plenary session of the European Parliament
I think we can take an optimistic approach to cooperation with Lebanon
However , we must bear in mind that Lebanon is in the middle of reconstruction , both economic and social and ideological reconstruction , following the civil war
Anyone visiting Lebanon has the distinct impression that it is still in search of cohesion and an identity
I think that the Accession Agreement will help Lebanon consolidate the rules of the burgeoning free market , democracy and economic and social development
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to make a number of very brief comments
My second comment is that Lebanon was hit by tragedy about twenty years ago
Today we have a very different country which is struggling hard to overcome huge structural problems
It is on our very doorstep and obviously we have a keen interest
Because of these two aspects , the European Union and the Council are keeping a very close eye on it and supporting its new policies
I have made careful note of what was said about human rights , and disappearances in particular , and I shall inform the Council accordingly
As you know , a great many measures and a great many decisions have been taken
It has already made a number of moves
I should like to finish by saying that an association agreement is an important tool
It can have a significant impact , but only under certain conditions
Where there are armed conflicts and insecurity , it obviously will not have the same results
Mr President , the temporary confusion that may have reigned in Lebanon from time to time has obviously led to confusion in Parliament
I have received a motion for a resolution in accordance with Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure on the subject of the deb@@ ate@@ 1
Mr President , I will try to live up to that request
We turn now from one end of Europe , as it were , to another
The Northern Dimension continues to occupy an extremely important place on the Commission 's external relations agenda
We are determined to continue to take a leading role in carrying forward this important initiative
Last year saw significant progress in all nine sectors encom@@ passed by the Action Plan
The Commission 's 2002 Annual Progress Report on the implementation of the Northern Dimension action plan presents a complete overview of these results
I would like to pick out a few concrete examples
The Commission has actively contributed to launching the Northern Dimension environmental partnership , with its support fund for environmental and nuclear projects in North@@ west Russia
The Commission is by far the largest contributor to the fund , with EUR 50 million over three years , mainly for nuclear@@ -related projects
The Northern Dimension environmental partnership is a clear example of how cooperation in the Northern Dimension region can achieve tangible results in very sensitive areas , calling for urgent action
In this context much attention is also being devoted to resolving the remaining details of the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme for the Russian Federation , the so-called MNEPR
I hope that we are now very close to a solution and that this key agreement can be signed very soon
This has already helped bring about a considerable increase in the number of joint projects being presented for Tac@@ is@@ /@@ Interreg or Tac@@ is@@ /@@ Phare funding in 2001-2002
The past year has also seen continued dialogue with the most important actors involved in the Northern Dimension
We have already provided more than EUR 40 million to the development of Kaliningrad and an additional EUR 25 million is planned for the coming years
We are determined to assist the Russian authorities in improving living standards and addressing the challenges it poses to the wider region
Building on the positive results already achieved , the Northern Dimension will be further strengthened in the near future
Two ministerial meetings were organised by Denmark in the last six months , both focussing on the next Action Plan
On the basis of Guidelines adopted by the Council in October last year , the Commission is preparing the next Northern Dimension Action Plan for the period 200@@ 4-@@ 2006
We are carrying out an extensive consultation process involving Member States , Partn@@ er Countries , and regional bodies , as well as the business world , acade@@ mia and civil society
There is still a lot of work to be done
The Commission is willingly taking the lead in preparing this new Action Plan
There were just 25 of us in all , and our chairman was the current French President , Jacques Chirac
We adopted the slogan ' There is no great Russia without Europe , and no great Europe without Russia ' for it
Along with such issues as organised crime , human trafficking and drug routes , these obstacles still constitute a regional threat , even though the security threat may have rec@@ eded
Our most crucial problem , however , is making Russia an integral part of this work
Nevertheless , as we heard , for the Union the notion of the Northern Dimension has been a tool to shape strategy
The Commission will have several new members in 2004
I still think it is worth considering that one of them should focus on developing cooperation with our neighbours Russia , Ukraine , Belarus and the Mediterranean regions
This would be practical work that would not , Commissioner Patten , be in competition with the large-scale foreign policies laid down by others in the Commission or the Council
The importance of the existing delegations from these countries is growing , and they must become more active
Ladies and gentlemen , in all honesty how many of us are familiar with conditions in rural and border regions in North@@ west Russia or Ukraine ?
Our path has mainly led to the big cities and the administrative authorities
Our job is to encourage and assist them
I would like to thank the Commission for its report and also its ideas for the future
I believe that we have done a lot of the foundation work since 1999 with a view to getting Russia still more actively involved
The size of the appropriation and whether it increases will then depend more on our partners in Russia and in other countries in the neighbouring regions than on us
After all , we in the Nordic countries also understand the importance of the Barcelona Process and the Mediterranean Partnership
The aim must be that the Commission makes a greater commitment to respond to the special questions posed by the EU 's northern regions
I myself , however , have already had the opportunity to hear this assurance personally
The EU 's forthcoming Northern Dimension Action Plan must be broad in scope , to make possible political and economic dialogue and action in all sectors of society
As Commissioner Patten has already said , very much has already been done in the area of cooperation on energy
What is more , progress has been made in projects devoted to cooperation on environmental issues
In that area , of course , cooperation has to be strengthened further
There are many challenges in the Northern Dimension region , and not least those to do with nuclear power and nuclear waste
In addition , the Gulf of Finland is vulnerable , and for this reason , progress has still to be made with the sewage treatment projects in St
Health and social issues usually go hand in hand
B@@ ad social conditions are responsible for poor health as well as disease , which spreads across borders , and we need vigorous cooperation in this area
The Commission has already begun work to develop the PHARE , TACIS and Interreg programmes of cooperation
We nevertheless need administrative reforms , one common programme to implement action in this area , and less bureaucracy and more action
I believe that these matters will be taken into account in the forthcoming action plan
I want to concentrate on process - that is what concerns me - and Parliament 's right to contribute properly to the new action plan
I welcome the action plan and the effort that both the Swedish presidency and most recently , the Danish presidency , have put in to the Northern Dimension
Enlargement will represent a step change in the Northern Dimension
It will no longer be a matter of high foreign policy just about the relationship with Russia
It will be about many countries that will now be Member States and the neighbours will be different
It will involve matters that have to do with the EU 's regional and environmental policy
That means that civil society and Members of this House and other elected representatives need to be properly and fully involved
At the first ministerial meeting I attended in Luxembourg , there was a commitment to have a Northern Dimension forum
It has yet to see the light of day
That ought to have happened a long time ago
I sense that there is some reluctance to fully involve this House in the Northern Dimension
The environment and climate in the far north is important to European solidarity
I urge the Commissioner to involve this House fully
Mr President , the Northern Dimension is the northern equivalent of the European Union-@@ Mediterranean Partnership
Although we speak of the north , it also refers to the EU 's eastern external dimension
There are two seas in the north , which have to be protected from catastrophe
The Baltic Sea , which will soon be virtually an internal sea of the EU , is the world 's most polluted sea
As we speak it is frozen over , which illustrates how problematic the natural conditions are there
An oil disaster on the scale of the Prestige wreck would be devastating
The Baren@@ ts Sea , on the other hand , is threatened by nuclear waste and the exploitation of natural resources on the seabed
As a gas pipeline is being built from the Baren@@ ts Sea to Germany we will also need investment from Member States to prevent environmental damage resulting from gas production
Our group is pleased with the resolution the political groups have together agreed upon here
It sets forth the key issues that the Commission must take account of when it drafts the action plan for the period 200@@ 4-@@ 2006
Unfortunately , the countries to hold the presidency this year have not included a mention of the development of the Northern Dimension in the Council 's action programme
Something that is of strategic importance is cooperation on energy
The EU is dependent for energy on gas imported from the east
The intention is to meet the entire increase in the EU 's energy needs over the next few decades with gas from the east
Investment in the energy sector will improve the reliability of the supply of gas and ensure there is shared responsibility for the sustainable exploitation of energy resources
Important areas of cooperation also include western investment in environmental protection , nuclear safety and transport infrastructure
Some pilot projects have been set up in order to solve Russia 's environmental problems
The Northern Dimension is furthermore concerned with the fight against poverty in the EU 's neighbouring regions
Civil society has been acting independently and we must ensure it is more involved in EU projects
NGOs are weapons in the struggle against bureaucracy both in the EU and in Russia
The Northern Dimension motor@@ car today is being driven in too low a gear
The car is not an automatic , and Greece and Italy must therefore now change up to a higher gear
the representative of the Greek Presidency should have been present here while we are speaking about the Northern Dimension
The area of responsibility of the country holding the presidency is not only the Mediterranean but also the other seas in the EU
Mr President , Commissioner Patten , I would very much like to welcome you to Parliament to discuss the Northern Dimension with us
We now hope that in this way Parliament 's involvement in the Northern Dimension will become established
Commissioner , you mentioned some successful projects , and I would like to show you my support in your mention of the financing of the environmental programme
I believe that we really now have to embark on this project without delay and ensure that Russia does actually see the ratification of this agreement through to the end
If the per@@ ma@@ fro@@ st starts to th@@ aw in the north many kinds of disasters will result
As a result , Parliament has invited representatives of the ab@@ original peoples to discuss these and other questions that relate to the Northern Dimension and Arctic cooperation this spring
Finally , I just want to say that it will be an immense challenge to cross the prosperity chasm that exists between Russia and the European Union
It will be a crucial challenge indeed , and we can promote it though cooperation in the social welfare and health sectors within the context of the programme
The enlargement of the European Union places the countries of the Northern Dimension in a very special and much changed position
Everyone is expecting a great deal from this - including strong economic development in particular
The greater mutual openness shows that there are extremely attractive prospects for cooperation in the economic , ecological and social fields
If we are to benefit from this we will have to change our attitude towards Russia
It has already changed , fortunately , but it was not just a matter of course
The politics of the Northern Dimension is therefore part of our two-@@ track policy
A policy that does not withhold criticism , however severe it may be , but one that also sounds out and exploits constructive ideas
It is very important to implement the various forms of policy in the action plan
The European Union 's attitude will then be very balanced and multi-faceted , which will also be good for the development of neighbouring regions
The way in which this is done is also naturally of great importance , and this is also mostly of a political and cultural nature
Market participants as well as social organisations , for example , will have to play a major role
Political integration must always go hand in hand with social integra@@ tion; this may entail a large number of independent organisations
The action plan may therefore also be relevant to the social democratisation of the territories in question - with Russia first
The Danish Presidency made great efforts with regard to the Northern Dimension issue
Coming from a southern northern country , I appreciate this very much
We are assuming that Greece will also feel a sense of responsibility towards the Northern Dimension
The focus must be on the exploitation of energy sources , the transportation of energy , possibly including to the European Union , and nuclear waste
The delegation to the Russian Duma recently went to the north , where we found out about the serious problems caused by nuclear waste
The European Union is one of the major donors , possibly the biggest in fact , but cleaning up is taking place pretty slowly there
They are not able to dismantle more than a small number of nuclear submarines each year
The territory there in the north is extremely vulnerable , and we will have to accept our responsibility , particularly with regard to Norway and other countries with interests there
It is a very good thing - for the people who live there as well - that solutions are also being found for waste water , particularly in St
We have seen that there are already numerous councils and forums dealing with the Northern Dimension
I must therefore express the hope that their activities will be appropriately coordinated so that they do not overlap too much and hamper one another
A budget line for the Northern Dimension has also already been discussed
I understand that there are technical problems involved in setting up a budget line of this kind and I would like to know what the Commissioner thinks about this
Mr President , Commissioner , there are a number of points I would very much like to deal with
Those of my colleagues who have spoken before me have covered quite a lot , so please permit me to focus on a few aspects
To take one example , you were right to mention in the action plan the various meetings that you had with Canada and Russia
I think that what you are undertaking in those areas is of great interest
Like my colleagues , I would like to see Parliament more closely involved in this work
You have also , however , incorporated issues of health , research , infrastructure , energy and the information economy as a whole
This sort of cooperation could actually be a source of strength to you , and I believe that you still need it
There is one thing I find lacking among all the interests and diverse topics that you address
It may be that I have overlooked this , and if that is the case , I cra@@ ve your indulgence
Mr President , the concept of the Northern Dimension must be understood in a broad sense
It embraces both the Union 's external relations and its internal policies
In external relations it encompasses the Baltic Sea and Baren@@ ts Sea areas and the whole of the Arctic region
Then again , we also have two viable multilateral forums , the Council of the Baltic Sea States and the Baren@@ ts Euro-@@ Arctic Council
Bilateral and multilateral action are both restricted by a lack of funds
In bilateral cross-border cooperation EU funding is limited to Interreg projects and to a small number of TACIS projects
Baren@@ ts and Baltic Sea cooperation is not financed by the Union at all
It is being proposed once again in our joint resolution that a special budget heading should be created for the Northern Dimension
This time we are discussing the Northern Dimension on the basis of a statement by the Commissioner in charge of External Relations
The importance of the Northern Dimension will also grow with regard to internal policies , when the Baltic countries and Poland join the Union
The list of partners is no less impressive than that of any previous initiative
Ap@@ preci@@ ation of these and other positive aspects does not preclude critical observations , and I will limit myself to two of them
It is , for example , striking that the Council , in producing its directives , is to some degree working on the basis of a decidedly uncritical analysis
That has also , alas , and to a somewhat lesser degree , been true of the statements from the Commission
An example of what I mean by this is the uncertainty still felt by many investors with a particular interest in involvement in the candidate countries and in Russia
De@@ fic@@ i@@ encies in administration and in the justice system are kept quiet for appearances ' sake rather than described in terms that reflect the reality
Existing concepts and plans for road and rail transport need to be realised more quickly if real improvements are to be made
To sum up , the plans made to date , and the results that have been achieved , should be seen in a very positive light
What is now needed is for priorities to be set out more clearly than before and decisive improvements made in key areas
The United States of America is building - has already built - a network of military bases close to Russia 's southern border
With Azerbaijan and Georgia it is constructing an oil pipeline past Russia to Turkey
The oil pipeline that passes through Chechnya has been damaged by the war
Within a short time it will be constructing its second oil port at the end of the Gulf of Finland
An enormous gas pipeline project from the Arctic Ocean , via the Baltic Sea , to Central Europe is already being planned
At the same time trial shipments of oil are being delivered from the O@@ b del@@ ta area to Murmansk and from there to the world markets
Now it is a question of what the role of the European Union is
Because it is in that area that our dependence on Russia is most clearly visible
As Hei@@ di Hautala said , a good example of this in the area of financing is the environmental programme fund
The money therefore exis@@ ts; now it is a question of action
Negotiations on the accession of ten countries to the EEA were launched in Brussels just last week
Enlargement of the EU entails simultaneous enlargement of the EEA in order to safeguard the homogene@@ ity of the internal market
Third countries do not enjoy the same rights and privileges as Member States; in some cases there is reduced market access due to tariff imposition
An example is Norway 's loss of free trade in fish with Poland
The EEA Agreement is a good agreement but it has its limitations
It is important for the EU to maintain its dual-@@ track approach and pressure for democratic reforms there
But notwithstanding our political differences with that country , we are still committed in areas of mutual interest such as the management of illegal immigration and cross-border crime
Mr President , in view of the delicate situation in relation to Kaliningrad and the imminent accession of the Baltic States , the Northern Dimension takes on even greater significance
We have to try to ensure that in all our policies we have as close a relationship with Russia as is possible
The Northern Dimension has ensured that we are able to focus on developments in the Baltic area , in terms of energy supplies , telecommunications , and economic assistance
Mr President , those who think the Northern Dimension is buried are wrong
There is greater need for the project at present than ever before
The reliability of energy management in the Baltic countries will be among the challenges of the future
Something else will need to be found to replace bit@@ uminous sh@@ ale and Ignalina
One cannot merely rely on gas imported from Russia
The Baltic R@@ ing must be involved in the programme
The programme must also show clear links to EU relations with the northern parts of Norway , Iceland , Greenland , the United States of America and Canada
The aim is for the Northern Dimension to grow to rank with the MEDA Programme among other good EU programmes
The Northern Dimension , like the MEDA Programme too , is a matter for the whole of the EU
The project has , with reason , been criticised for having nothing concrete to offer
The problem with the Northern Dimension has been that funding has been scrap@@ ed together from various EU programmes
The decentralised character of its management , spread among several of the Commission 's Directorates-General as it is , only complicates the work
The project is like a patchwork quilt
I also support the idea that the Northern Dimension should have its own budget heading , which is in accord with my earlier proposals
Mr President , I am glad that the Greek Presidency has returned after an absence which had attracted some criticism
That is something that we perhaps ought to organise differently in future , as we should give attention to the regions in a more even-handed way
My fellow Members have , of course , listed the various subject areas more than once
I would like to say something about border management
I believe that many working in the field of exports and imports would see their costs for goods and services fall substantially
I also hope that , as regards the combating of criminality at these borders , the Russians ?
Mr President , you have given me a key@@ note to use
So I claim the right to speak on behalf of the Members from the South and to assert that we too have an interest in the North 's well being
I take it for granted that you , Mr President , agree with me
I would like to be brief and to touch on the following topics , the first of which is energy
What matters here is that the Baltic R@@ ing should at last come into being , with an electricity interconnection right round the Baltic
That would be a great help to us and also to the Baltic States
The second point I want to make is that we must at all cost prevent any mis@@ ha@@ p involving oil or gas in the far north
It would take many years for nature to recover , far longer than would be the case in the south
That is something we must avoid come what may
It is only right , though , that this House should discuss them and make them known to a wider public
If I might return to the subject of energy , I would like to bring a paradox to your attention
Here in Western Europe , we are replacing coal and atomic power with gas , which we will , in future , be buying increasingly from Russia
Taking all these things together , then , no savings are being made either in atomic power or in CO2
What is going on here is quite simply absurd , at any rate from an out@@ sider 's point of view
Mr President , I welcome the fact that the Northern Dimension is now being placed on the EU 's agenda
In Commissioner Patten , the EU has a strong leader in the area of foreign policy
I also want to discuss the strategy in relation to Belarus within the framework of the Northern Dimension
We cannot afford to have pariah states adjacent to our own borders in Europe
This should be combined with initially low-@@ level discussions with the Bel@@ or@@ us@@ sian authorities on the subjects of crime prevention and border controls
This dialogue should also take place with a view to stimulating economic development in Belarus and strengthening civil society
The Baltic is not far from being a mare no@@ str@@ um within the European Union
It is an economic area that must be developed
In our relations with Russia , we must continue to demand greater democracy
We must not , however , forget to enter into low-@@ level political relations with Belarus
These are a necessity
Mr President , the motion for a resolution on the Northern Dimension properly underscores some of the most important issues of the present time
The Northern Dimension , however , has to be seen as a dynamic process
With enlargement too the role of the EU in the Baltic Sea will alter significantly
In practice the Baltic from the start of next year will be an internal sea of the EU
With its problems and opportunities it must be generally visible in EU policy
The prominence given to the Baltic Sea in all EU policy must increase , whilst at the same time its importance as part of the EU 's Northern Dimension less@@ ens
Naturally , Russia in the future will be an important part of Northern Dimension content , but west and east are close together at the Arctic C@@ ir@@ cle
The Northern Dimension will also enable ties to the west to be strengthened
At the same time it would strengthen Euro-@@ Atlantic mutual understanding in the area of the environment , which recently has not been the best possible
EU policy on climate change could in this way obtain a new basis internationally on which to build practical action
To close this debate , I have received four motions for resolutions presented in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure
The next item is Questions to the Council
The following questions are addressed to the Council
As they deal with the same subject , Questions No 1 and 2 will be taken together
On 13 November 2002 , the tanker the Prestige was damaged off the coast of Galicia and subsequently sank , causing an environmental disaster
When the directives and rules on maritime safety were adopted under the Erika I and II packages , their implementation was deferred , with some deadlines extending into 2003
Would it not be appropriate to bring forward the date of entry into force and to implement the directives immediately in order to avoid another major disaster ?
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we all know the serious repercussions this issue had recently
However , I shall endeavour to keep to the questions asked
The new European Maritime Safety Agency is proof positive of this determination
On 6 and 9 December , the Council took measures , in the form of Council conclusions , on certain aspects of maritime transport and environmental protection
Parliament and the Council approved five of the six acts proposed by the Commission in the Erika I and Erika II packages of legislative measures under the codecision procedure
I was rapporteur for one of the reports on the Erika I package
The Erika accident took place on 19 December 1999
I believe that the Commission did its work perfectly , because in March 2000 it presented us with this first package of measures
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , you have not answered my questions on the maritime areas located between the Canaries , Madeira , the Azores and the European Union
You will understand better if we imagine this in the context of your own country
What would be the consequences for your islands ?
Do you not believe , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that the European Union must adopt rules to regulate the maritime areas which endanger its coasts ?
The United States and Canada have done so , outside their own territorial waters , and I believe that the European Union would have the power to do so
I have already pointed out that the Council and the Greek Presidency are very keen to push this measure through
We were in full agreement with the decisions taken by the Council in December and will be setting the relevant procedures in motion as quickly as possible
I would like to make a brief comment to the President-in-Office of the Council , whom I wish all the luck in the world
We need the Council to act more quickly
As a result of 1 January and the Prestige disaster , the Spanish State has applied certain more restrictive rules for single-hull ships
This has led to que@@ ues of single-hull ships entering Gibraltar in order to evade inspections
This is not a question , but an opinion which we take note of , but if the President-in-Office of the Council wishes to reply
Mr President , the President-in-Office of the Council has just called this problem a ' natural disaster '
I should like to ask him why he attribu@@ tes natural causes to a disaster that has clearly occurred as the result of political and therefore preventable reasons ?
A natural disaster is clearly something quite different
This is like calling a crash involving several cars or lorries on a motorway a natural disaster
It is other types of causes that need to be cleared up
I feel that the Greek Presidency is getting off to a bad start on this matter if it thinks that this is really a natural disaster
why are you calling this a natural disaster , which I believe is a complete mis@@ nom@@ er ?
This is a linguistic question
I will not make any judgment of intentions , because the President-in-Office of the Council will reply to it as he sees fit
In any event , it is a supplementary question
If the President-in-Office wishes to give his opinion
The question is , where does an accident end and a natural disaster begin ?
This is something which , if you look at it literally , you end up in a different debate which I think there is no point getting into
Mr President , I respected your authority at all times , since I did not know whether or not I could ask a supplementary question
It is not my place to tell the European Parliament whether or not it should set up a committee
Additional measures therefore need to be adopted
Standards must be established to prevent this terrible situation continuing
Next , we should surely amend all international legislation
I wish to ask whether you will be adopting initiatives to achieve this ?
Naturally , no one can accept that an accident of this sort should lead to a disaster of such magnitude
The Commission presented its proposal on 19 December
The European Parliament gave its opinion on the same day
The aims of the proposal are to help compensate the damages , by a contribution of the Community
Financial assistance is foreseen through the reallocation of funds including re@@ programming the Spanish share of the Financial Instru@@ ment for Fisheries Guidance
Would you accept that the problem that we face in the seas of Europe is not only about maritime safety and environmental pollution ?
Would you not accept that we need an adequate response mechanism and that the only way to address the problem would be to establish an EU coastguard ?
Do you not think we could learn from the United States ' comprehensive approach to these problems ?
If for example a terrorist attack using chemical , biological or nuclear weapons were to be launched at sea , a coastguard could be the first line of response
I disagree with you that it is not within the Council 's remit
It has always been in the Council 's remit to consider ways of addressing the public 's fears
Citizens are sometimes disillusion@@ ed with the EU
Would you not accept that dealing with problems that threaten their safety and wellbeing in a coordinated and comprehensive way will help convince them of the values of Europe ?
I would remind the honourable Members in general that during this Question Time , specific questions must be put for one minute
I have a list of several who wish to ask supplementary questions
In accordance with the order in which they have requested the floor , Mr Ortuondo and Mr D@@ haene are before everybody else
I would like to ask him specifically whether he believes that , for this type of disaster , we also need an emergency pilot plan at European level
Do you not believe that we should have a European rapid reaction force for this type of incident , including volunteers ?
Do you not also believe that we should identify particularly sensitive corridors , so that we can have an emergency plan in each case ?
I think that , from what I have said , I have already replied to this question
We need committees to examine why these accidents happened , the problems they created and the action needed when these situations arise which are so hard to manage
Mr President , I am somewhat surprised that the Council has replied that it is not authorised to set up a coastguard
It will nevertheless have to make a decision about this
Will he defend this in the Council ?
I would like a clear answer on this point
Perhaps I did not make my position perfectly clear
This is an independent institutional body , an independent institution and we cannot interfere in its discussions
Having said which , if the European Commission submits a proposal , the Council will obviously examine it and take a decision in the usual manner
does the President-in-Office of the Council intend to visit Galicia ?
Yes , I am restricted by the Rules of Procedure
Accession negotiations with Cyprus were completed on 13 December at the European Council in Copenhagen
Cyprus is due to be accepted as a new Member State of the European Union on 1 May 2004
The Union has , however , made it perfectly clear that it would prefer a united Cyprus to join
I appreciate that this question is out of date but that is because I had to submit it about two months ago , before the European Council in Copenhagen
Minister , you know our party 's position on the accession of Cyprus to the European Union
If the free part of the island acce@@ des , Cyprus will be parti@@ tioned
If the Annan plan is adopted , it will be parti@@ tioned through the back door
If no agreement is reached on the Annan plan and the free part of the island acce@@ des , part of the European Union will be under foreign occupation
May I point out that it is not just one part of Cyprus that will accede
Under the decisions taken , the whole of Cyprus will accede
It is just that the acquis communautaire cannot be applied in one part of Cyprus
As for my thoughts , my thoughts are that we hope a solution can be found
I must point out that the Council does not comment on judicial proceedings in Member States
Nor is the Council in a position to express an opinion on the monitoring system set up under the European Convention on Human Rights
This Convention was adopted under the aegis of the Council of Europe
Similarly , the international system set up to monitor the application of the Convention by its signatories also operates under the aegis of the Council of Europe
The Council does not consider its duties to include commenting on how international human rights monitoring systems set up by international organisations function
The Minister is right
But I would like to feel that the Minister was giving me some kind of response as to whether in his view the Council thinks this is an important priority
He said he could not comment on the European Convention on Human Rights but I think we are also talking about the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
We are talking about the problems of implementing the European Ar@@ rest War@@ rant in some countries because of fears that there are not minimum standards throughout the EU
Could I get some kind of feeling from the Council that they consider this as important as the Commission does ?
The implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is one of the issues being discussed by the European Convention
Mr President-in-Office , this question raises the matter of safeguards , but within the context of harmonised criminal legislation in Europe
The Greek Government has shown that it understands this problem
I repeat that the Council will examine any proposals which are compatible with the institutional system of the European Union , because there is no going beyond those limits
Greece , speaking as the presidency of the Union , supports the communitisation of the third pillar within the framework of the European Convention
The Council decided in the first half of 2002 that the European Police A@@ ca@@ de@@ my would be set up in Denmark temporarily , pending a decision on its final seat
Until a final solution is found , the present temporary arrangements appear to be working satisfactorily
This common unit was created at the meeting of the Council 's strategic committee on immigration , frontiers and asylum held on 2@@ 2-@@ 23 June 2002
The common unit , known as ' S@@ CI@@ FA + ' , immediately undertook to apply the management plan and met five times during the Danish Presidency
One of these meetings was also attended by the candidate countries
Mr President , I would like to start by asking when a final decision will be taken on the seat of the Police A@@ ca@@ de@@ my
You may well be aware that Parliament , at my suggestion , proposed this Police A@@ ca@@ de@@ my in 1998 and brought it into being
We actually thought it should be sit@@ ed in the border zone between the present-day EU and the candidate countries
when is a decision going to be taken about the A@@ ca@@ de@@ my 's eventual location ?
My reply to the question of when a final decision will be taken is that it depends on when the Member States agree
As you know , this raises a great many questions , which are being examined and to which answers have to be found so that they can be resolved
We , both as the Greek Presidency and as a Member State , are very keen to move in this direction
The honourable Member 's third question is almost identical to his first
As part of the Greek Presidency , does the Council intend to adopt specific strategies and measures to give a new impetus to SMEs ?
As the honourable Member knows , encouraging and supporting small and medium-sized enterprises is one of the Greek Presidency 's priorities under the Lisbon strategy
The Commission has announced that the Green Paper on the entrepreneurial spirit and SMEs to which the honourable lady refers will be submitted shortly
As soon as the Green Paper is submitted , it will be dealt with by the relevant Councils with due priority
Improving the general situation of SMEs and , more importantly , the entrepreneurship which attaches to SMEs , is of vital importance to any present-day industrial or business policy
Mr President-in-Office , my apologies for making you say things we already know
The initiative we took a year ago , as a Member State , is most conducive to dealing with the problems of small and medium-sized enterprises
So what are these problems and where do we think we can help ?
Did the Council take any account of this when setting the date ?
On the same date , the provisions contained in the Treaty of Nice concerning the Commission and voting in the Council will enter into force
The necessary consultations with the European Parliament on these matters are continuing and will be concluded by the end of January 2003
My question was not about the whole range of things you talked about; on the contrary , it was very specific
Be it in dr@@ ach@@ mas or euro , it is still money , and the taxpayers ' money at that
Did the Council take this into account at all when setting the date ?
But the Council is obliged to comply with the institutional procedures of the European Union and the consequences of the accession of the Member States on the specific dates set
Attempts to over@@ throw the legally elected President of Venezuela
Following the failed coup d' et@@ at in Venezuela , attempts by the economic and political establishment of the country , together with its international allies ( USA etc
) to over@@ throw President Cha@@ ve@@ z are intensifying
Against this backdrop , the European Union is forcefully backing efforts by the Secretary General of the ? ? S to pave the way for dialogue and national reconciliation
Our group organised an event yesterday which was attended by guests from the Venezuelan Parliament , who gave us some idea of the situation in Venezuela
We would have hoped for something different
I think that the Council is exha@@ usting and will continue to exhaust whatever powers it has in this direction with respect to Venezuela
I have nothing further to add , because that covers a great many issues
These actions are completely at odds with the UN resolutions and cast doubt on the work of the inspectors
The honourable Member is aware of the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council on Iraq
As you know , the UN has been carrying out weapons inspections in Iraq under Resolution 14@@ 41 since 27 November
The whole point of this resolution is to give Iraq a chance to disarm peace@@ ably
I repeat what the President-in-Office of the Council said yesterday , that war is not inevitable
The UN Security Council is still the main forum for resolving the Iraqi issue
We have listened to the prime minister of Greece and the President-in-Office both today and yesterday and , what can I say , we are speech@@ less
It would be a different matter if this were part of a joint endeavour aimed at general disarmament
But we heard it yesterday and we heard it again today
Iraq has to be taught a lesson and dis@@ armed
A clear common position has to be adopted on Iraq
Mr Sim@@ itis also said yesterday that it is irrelevant that the European Union has four members , the Security Council will decide
And what is he going to do with these four members ?
He is calling on other members , Mr President , China and Russia
Of course they too have a responsibility , but what will the four from the European Union do ?
Is this our peace effort ?
The Council feels that we should respect the institutional role of the UN Security Council and the role it plays in the world order in general
Basically , we want to see what happens and what decisions the Security Council will take
Whether the inspectors are or are not effective and how they evaluate the overall situation will be assessed once they have submitted their report
The European Union as such is not pressing one way or the other
The Council has not taken a stand on the USA 's missile defence plans , nor has any Member State taken a stand on this issue in the Council
I have made a note of the honourable Member 's stand and shall bear it in mind
This is not in fact a question
When it is not a question it is up to the President-in-Office of the Council to speak as he sees fit
For the supplementary question , Mr Korakas has the floor for one minute
As you will have noticed , strong protests have been voiced here in Parliament against the decision by the United States to cancel the ? ? ?
Treat@@ y; we have all said that this will provoke a new round , a new arms race and a huge risk , a huge threat to world peace
You said about the bases , ' I do n't know , it was n't in the question '
Sou@@ da is in Greece
I think I have replied , with the positions that I have stated
You know what the procedure and process for promoting foreign policy issues is at European Union level
I therefore stand by them and I think that , in what I have said , I have replied to the questions put to me on this issue
Since they deal with similar subjects , Questions Nos 13 and 14 will be taken together
During the most recent EU-Russia summit of 11 November 2002 in Brussels , both parties referred to the situation in Chechnya
Does the Council now have any concrete indications that the Russian Federation has since taken any constructive steps on any of these matters ?
The issues raised by the honourable Members have been raised on numerous occasions during political dialogue with Russia
Obviously , the situation in the Russian Republic of Chechnya continues to cause the European Union a great deal of concern
With this human rights situation in Chechnya , it is a real pity that we let the OSCE Assistance Group mandate lapse
It proves that there are Russian authorities working to resolve the issues raised by the ? U and other agencies
The European Court of Human Rights considered that Moscow has given sufficient guarantees to allow persons of Chechen origin who appear to be terrorists to be extradited to Russia
At the same time , concern is still being voiced about the fate of those who do return to Chechnya
The ? U has insisted that suitable conditions for these people to return to and live in must be provided in advance
Finally , the ? U is currently examining its position and its strategy for the forthcoming 5@@ 9@@ th Assembly of the UN Commission on Human Rights
I cannot give you any details until suitable negotiations have been held with all the Member States
Mr President , we are particularly anxious that the situation in Chechnya seems to have worsened dramatically since the oral question was submitted to the Council
Let us hope that with all the influence we can bring to bear , the image we have of Chechnya will soon take a turn for the better
Firstly I would like to wish the Greek minister much success with the Presidency over the next six months
It is a big job , and I really wish you much success
I would also like to thank you for your very detailed answer , Mr Y@@ iann@@ it@@ sis
You made a very long statement
I cannot , however , help but feel that you did not write it yourself
It is , of course , a statement that has been drawn up following consultation between the 15 , between diplomats
And , if you will excuse me saying so , it is a statement that has nothing to do with the reality in situ
All the reports that reach us - Mr Wuori has pointed this out - refer to a very serious human rights situation
We all know that the problem in Chechnya can only be resolved with political consultation , with discussions between people and between representatives
The fact that the Council is showing an interest and constantly intervenes along these lines proves it is determined to influence the situation in Chechnya
Mr President , the OSCE has , as we know , been expelled
The Russians do not want anyone in the region
The Russians can get first-hand information in the European Union anywhere and at any time
We want our Russian partners to accord us the same right of being able to inform ourselves where and as things are happening
This question echoes the questions worded in more general terms by previous honourable Members
My reply , therefore , is that the Council is constantly looking for specific ways in which to influence the situation in Chechnya
Mr Y@@ iann@@ it@@ sis , I am very grateful for your cooperation with us throughout this afternoon and we will see you for Question Time next month in Strasbourg
That concludes Questions to the Council
( The sitting was closed at 7 p
The Seville Council decided to create yet another repressive supranational mechanism , the European Corps of Border Gu@@ ards
What is worrying is that the report adopted by the European Parliament is even more autocratic than the Commission communication
This was to take place before June 2003 , which is why the results of this study have still not been implemented
Several years ago we initiated the successful European Year for older people which acknowledged the contribution of older people in our society
The Employment Committee 's report has considerably expanded this framework
I am pleased that the communication is being debated so that the Member States and the public can learn more about the challenges involved
The organisation of health care systems , their funding and planning are , of course , matters for the Member States
I did not support amendments which failed to recognise the positive developments in relation to care for older people
I support the Commission 's assessment that the EU has an overall health situation and health care system that are among the best in the world
I supported the amendments aimed at promoting cooperation rather than the open method of cooperation
The Council has welcomed the Annan plan as a proposal which may well resolve the Cyprus problem
The E@@ BR@@ D responded to me with great openness and willingness to cooperate , thus making my work on this report both interesting and informative
The E@@ BR@@ D is unique among development banks in having a political mandate
It is also part of the Bank 's political mandate to promote , across the full range of its activities , environmentally sound and sustainable development
In my view , political guidelines governing the activities of other development banks would be desirable as well
Having scrutinised its operations , we can att@@ est that the E@@ BR@@ D performs well in fulfilling its current mandate
In selecting the projects to be funded , the E@@ BR@@ D prefers to be involved in small and medium-sized projects rather than promoting large-scale prestige projects
It shows great willingness to take risks through its commitment to projects which other banks deem too risky , but it does not systematically seek the security of state guarantees
A key focus of its activities is developing small and medium-sized businesses
The E@@ BR@@ D 's micro-@@ financing projects deserve particular mention in this context
In my capacity as rapporteur , I would like to make a number of recommendations to the Bank , notwithstanding the positive assessment of its work overall
Although its activities focus primarily on the transitional promotion of private and public enterprise , its operations undoubtedly have macroeconomic effects
For this reason , an analysis of its operations should include economic data , which has not been the case to date
I am thinking especially of factors such as trends in employment , wages and salaries , productivity , company turnover , and so on
In this context , it should also be a stated aim of the E@@ BR@@ D 's operations to achieve synergy effects
It is also , in my view , important to encourage the Bank to tailor its policies to local circumstances
Each country in which it operates has taken different decisions on its economic structures throughout the transformation process , especially as regards the division between the public and private sectors
The Bank therefore should not attempt to operate in the same way in every country
It does not do so , but I want to point out that this risk must be controlled from the outset
This closes a gap which marked the E@@ BR@@ D out from other banks , such as the EIB , which has been subject to assessment by the EP for years
In future , a report on the E@@ BR@@ D will be presented to the European Parliament every two years
I think that with this own-initiative report , the foundation stone has been laid for positive and continuous cooperation between the Bank and the European Parliament
Mr President , I should first like to congratulate Mr Markov on his report on the activities of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
In our view , the report gives an accurate account of the nature of the Bank 's mandate and activities by identifying three features peculiar to it alone
Firstly , the Bank has both a political and an economic mandate
Secondly , it has implemented a policy of conditionality
In particular , this has affected the Bank 's involvement in environmental issues , as Mr Markov mentioned
Lastly , there is the commitment to both the additionality and profitability of the funds made available
This requires the Bank to take on risks private operators would decline
The pragmatic approach the E@@ BR@@ D brings to the interpretation of its mandate also features prominently in the report
In addition , support for strategic international investors has been enhanced
This same pragmatic approach has enabled the Bank , with the support of its shareholders , to adjust some of the limits to its mandate
Mr Markov 's report also rightly suggests placing additional emphasis on certain aspects of this pragmatic approach
One instance is more careful consideration of the social and political aspects of restructuring the productive sector
Another example is the reference to a more active role in the sustainable development of the energy sector
A further example is the reference to strengthening the Bank 's operations at municipal level
I should now like to say a few words about the relationship between the Union and the Bank
First , this is an entirely innovative relationship at the institutional level , since the E@@ BR@@ D is the only international institution of which the European Commission is a shareholder
This is particularly evident in the Board of Govern@@ ors
The Member States and the Union 's institutions together represent a majority when a vote is to be taken
Cooperation between the Community and the Bank is another significant feature , and has developed considerably
I believe it is now extremely close , and takes many different forms
In particular , cooperation was strengthened through the Bank 's active involvement in the pre-accession strategy
A network of working relationships between the services of the Commission and the Bank in now firmly established
This has resulted in a significant increase in that part of the Community budget devoted to supporting or cofinancing the Bank 's projects
In the early 1990s it was estimated that this contribution amounted to approximately EUR 40 million
In recent years , however , it has increased to an average annual sum of EUR 300 million
Finally , from the point of view of political priorities , cooperation with the Bank is indeed cause for satisfaction
The first of these is the Bank 's competence in the region
This is due to its extensive knowledge of the current situation in the countries in question
The second is the Bank 's practice of conditionality , which has often made it possible for the Bank 's involvement to serve to promote compliance with European standards
This has been the case with regard to the environment
Clearly , there is scope for further development of the Bank 's activities in Russia , in other C@@ IS States , and in the Balkans
It would also appear that there is scope for further involvement in the candidate countries following accession
In this connection , we endorse the view expressed in Mr Markov 's report
We certainly believe it would be wise to continue active cooperation with the E@@ BR@@ D following enlargement , whilst also working with the obvious partner , namely the European Investment Bank
This will enable us to continue to benefit from the E@@ BR@@ D 's experience after enlargement
As you have said , this is a first and it is very important for the institution that I have the honour to chair
This leads me to four brief and simple comments , since the report by Mr Markov and the proposals from Mr Solbes Mira have enlightened Parliament
The first comment relates to the institution itself
We are talking about an institution in which Europe plays a most essential role with many partners
What is the basic element binding them ?
I think that there are two types
First of all there is a very firm commitment to ensuring transition in the East
That is a commitment for everyone
These principles of additionality , conditionality and impact on transition are the real foundations of the institution
I must also mention a third dimension , which Mr Markov referred to just now , which is its political dimension
The E@@ BR@@ D has a political mandate
My second comment concerns experience acquired and strategy , as Mr Markov described
Currently , the bank is achieving high levels of assistance
Last year , we invested EUR 3
9 billion , which is the bank 's highest level of assistance
We are also implementing the strategy adopted by the Bank 's shareholders , which is development towards the East
We are maintaining a strong commitment in Central Europe
My second comment regarding strategy concerns the importance we attach to the development of small enterprises , micro-enterprises and SMEs
This was an unknown concept in the East ten years ago and today we are seeing it develop
We are implementing it , I must stress , in particular thanks to the support of our shareholders and of the European Union , who play a most essential role
We act as a lever for implementing these measures and we ensure that we work with the banking sector to improve its competence by training bankers to develop these techniques
If we are not able to do that , we create our own institutions , in order to ensure that the development takes place within the necessary timescale
In the same way , we are developing our efforts in terms of relations with all businesses in the East and in Japan
I think that the best example that I can give is the development of enterprises in the automobile sector , which attracts sub-contractors and enables the development of local sub-contractors
My fourth comment is concerning the proposals and comments made by your rapporteur
I would simply like to say that I share them
We agree , we take them on board and we will try to translate them into reality
I would just like to make two specific comments
We pay particular attention to employment issues , and also , more specifically , to charging policies
Improving the quality of life of the population , drinking water , transport and municipal services as a whole are part of charging policies
You are aware that the Eastern countries are not used to charging policies
Implementing sound , sustainable charging policies is therefore absolutely necessary , and they must be acceptable to the population
The environment is at the heart of the institution 's mandate
There is a great deal to be done
5 billion in funds allocated to nuclear clean@@ ing-up projects in the countries that are soon going to join the European Union and others that are a little further off
We see this as a fundamental activity
The European Union is our great partner and our great support , particularly through your contribution , Mr Solbes
Mr Solbes is our governor and monitors us closely with the required level of firmness
We work with the services of the European Union and of all the Member States openly and under excellent conditions
Our second partner is the EIB , which is an important partner for us
We welcome the necessary increase in its contributions , particularly to acceding countries
I work a great deal with Philippe Maystadt and we have a close relationship
You are aware that the EIB is a shareholder of the E@@ BR@@ D , like the Commission and the European Union
We therefore have a close , trusting relation@@ ship@@ ; our aim is certainly not to be redundant but to ensure that we complement each other as necessary
I am sorry that my speech was a little long
Mr President , I too would like to welcome Mr L@@ emi@@ erre and his colleagues to Parliament
His speech gave us a feeling that there is a combination of idealism , and also very considerable practicality , in the way they approach their job
I would also like to congratulate Mr Markov on his report
He has devoted much care , conscientious effort and good sense to assessing the role and performance of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
His comments are measured and are a positive contribution to the E@@ BR@@ D 's future
I recently read in the press the title ' The lit@@ tle-@@ known E@@ BR@@ D '
Perhaps this exposure in Parliament will help in that direction
The E@@ BR@@ D is also making a critical contribution to the countries which will border the enlarged European Union
The E@@ BR@@ D is the largest single foreign investor in Russia , and Russia is the largest country in its portfolio
Also of concern to us in the European Union is the work done by the bank in Yugoslavia , and the former republics of Yugoslavia and the Balkans
The monitoring and measurement of its success must therefore take into account how far it has achieved its aims , both economic and democratic
It is difficult to be other than impressed by the E@@ BR@@ D 's track record
The PPE-DE Group will be supporting Mr Markov 's report as it stands
We will vote against all but two of the amendments which have been tabled , as they do nothing to enhance the report
The exceptions concern the newly launched public information policy , which we welcome
We will therefore support Amendments 2 and 4 , which also welcome and encourage a more open and transparent approach
Hopefully , the next time Parliament drafts a report on the E@@ BR@@ D , it will be to welcome the continuing success of a well-known and widely esteemed institution
I wish the E@@ BR@@ D , its President , Mr L@@ emi@@ erre , its staff and its clients continuing success in 2003 and in the longer-term future
Their success is vitally important to us all
I would also like to thank our rapporteur , as he has shown how seriously Parliament has examined the work of the E@@ BR@@ D
The work of the E@@ BR@@ D deserves to be commended by Parliament , as it is an institution that is both original and exemplary
I think that it shows exemplary qualities that we could be guided by in several other areas
You are neither a European bank nor an extension of the World Bank and nevertheless you have close links with us
Finally , there is the capacity to constantly promote the activity of SMEs , which are particularly important to Parliament
I would like to specifically highlight two points in Mr Markov 's report
My second point is the subject of the amendments which I hope will be adopted by Parliament
you are not built on the model of the IMF
You said that this led you to halt your work in Belarus
As you are aware , such practices exist elsewhere
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr L@@ emi@@ erre , may I begin by congratulating Mr Markov on a sterling report
The E@@ BR@@ D has been , and will be , of great importance to the development of former Communist Europe
For many of the countries , the door is now open to membership of the EU
This is obviously the best way for them to secure a better social and economic future
There are , however , still many countries that are , and will be , outside the EU 's internal market
If the gul@@ fs between countries and peoples are not to increase further , the E@@ BR@@ D 's efforts are perhaps needed now more than ever
It is not easy to transform Communist planned economies that have suc@@ ked the life out of societies and people and introduce a market economy philosophy
We can now see the huge costs for the former GDR
Obviously , this must also be done in Russia where the trend is , in spite of everything , in the right direction
That is apparent from an interesting article in today 's Financial Times , quoting Mr L@@ emi@@ erre
We also proposed more emphasis on projects that support democratic development
Human rights must always be guaranteed
It is therefore good that the E@@ BR@@ D should freeze assets and investments when human rights are threatened
Mr Purvis mentioned the Balkans and Serbia
There too , I believe that the E@@ BR@@ D 's efforts are especially important in a situation in which democracy is very shaky and needs support
I also believe it is important to emphasise that the E@@ BR@@ D should be managed in a professional and efficient way
The way in which it is organised must therefore be continually monitored , and unnecessary and costly bureaucracy prevented
I want to conclude by saying that a number of the amendments concern the development of nuclear power
This is , in my opinion , a source of energy that is clean and reduces the increasing greenhouse effect
It reduces the risks of climate change if it is safe and properly managed
I wonder therefore what the Greens have against it
We can also welcome the political agreement of the French and German governments , which was crucial to completing the project
Now we have a great regional development bank and today we congratulate Mr L@@ emi@@ erre and the Bank 's staff
I am entirely in agreement with my colleague and friend Mr Markov , and will just raise some questions for the future
First of all , should the original political objective not be renewed ?
For the C@@ IS countries , this objective is still to promote transition to a market economy
Secondly , the Bank does not operate as an ordinary commercial bank
It gives priority to SMEs , helps local banks , takes on responsibilities in terms of nuclear safety , takes risks , in short , it serves the public interest
Should these specific qualities not be consolidated at a time when the Union is working on a funding system focused on the internal market ?
It is true that the Bank has a triple A rating , but that is linked to budgetary support , which we must guarantee
Are there not also problems in terms of achieving a balance between profit-making and loss-making projects ?
Finally , how can we consolidate the way that it complements public aid and the EIB ?
Thirdly , does the E@@ BR@@ D not have a particular role to play in order to promote social responsibility among companies and market operators ?
Its principle of additional funding is very good and provides it with a lever with which to encourage public@@ /@@ private partnerships
Could it not begin to evaluate that experience by country and group of countries and put its ideas for the future to us ?
It is our task to demand that it does so
This brings me to my points of criticism
This , as everyone knows , is not necessarily intended to end hostilities in this region and bring peace
On the contrary , more than one million people have become refugees here over the last ten years
The fact is that this project will not produce a peace agreement , but will simply let the conflict in the region sim@@ mer on
It is also unclear who bears the risk in the event of accidents
There are certainly no opportunities for local economic development
Transparency , too , must also be improved , especially transparency for the population
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is supporting dubious nuclear projects in Ro@@ v@@ no and Kh@@ mel@@ nit@@ sky
We know that the European Parliament has spoken out against this , because it is not convinced that these reactors can be made safe
We also know that they are being built solely to supply cheap electricity to Western Europe , not to resolve the problems in Ukraine
This House has therefore opposed any such investment
I would therefore like to ask the President how , in that case , the Development Bank has still transferred EUR two billion to EUR@@ A@@ TO@@ M to make these projects possible
The Markov report paints a very positive picture , particularly , of course , since it refers to the last few years
It is a difficult balance to strike , and one which I believe should be given careful attention
It is important not to let E@@ BR@@ D intervention end up penalising the growth of a private credit sector
Lastly , I turn to the European Union as the majority E@@ BR@@ D shareholder
We invest in the Ukraine , for instance , through the E@@ BR@@ D
This is admirable , but we are giving with one hand and taking away with the other through trade restrictions which weigh very heavily on a country like the Ukraine
Our two hands need to work in harmony
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr L@@ emi@@ erre , I would like to begin by thanking you and your staff for your work
The balan@@ ce-@@ sheet is impressive
We are pleased that the balan@@ ce-@@ sheet which you have delivered today gives no cause for criticism
Secondly , I endorse your priorities
We cannot adopt divergent priorities
I believe that the following points are important
Secondly , I think it is important to continue and intensify your work on boosting small and medium-sized enterprises
We are all aware of the key role played by SMEs in creating and consolidating training places and jobs
Our expectation is that you will increase this commitment , especially by strengthening the focus on equity investment for SMEs and supporting the development of an SME infrastructure
I would simply point out that in Russia , only 10 % of the workforce is employed in SMEs
Furthermore , of course , we need a priority headed ' accession countries '
However , EU enlargement will not be complete in 2004
I therefore ask you to continue your policy course and to take Parliament 's ideas on board
We will support you in this approach
Mr President , the E@@ BR@@ D is funded by the taxpayer , which is why transparency must be established in respect of its activities
Even in Parliament , opinions were divided as to whether we should indeed still have our own bank
This too must play a part in today 's debate
Mr L@@ emi@@ erre , you have described the Bank 's task as being a ' classical ' general interest service which , however , makes use of private-sector intervention instruments
This is undoubtedly an apt description and we must test its activities to determine to what extent this is actually being realised
For this reason , I welcome the fact that you have concentrated 30 % of your resources on this sector
I also recognise that your activities in the promotion of small and medium-sized businesses are important to a functioning market economy and to the development of democracy
However , what is also important is to see how stability can be achieved in these countries
How can we facilitate economic growth through investment ?
That is an issue which constantly occupies our minds in the European Union as well
This is reflected in the high rating the Bank has received from rating agencies
The Bank is unique among multilateral development banks in having a political mandate
Its task is to contribute to a social market economy , democracy , pluralism and the rule of law
In this context , you should focus even more strongly on ensuring respect for human rights and democratic principles
You should deny support , to an even greater extent than before , to states and companies which engage in unfair practices and in which there is corruption and mismanagement
This should also apply to failure to comply with the objectives of environmentally sound , socially compatible and sustainable development
The E@@ BR@@ D is still operational in Central and Eastern Europe
These states ' accession to the EU will open up many investment opportunities , which will not be available to other states
The transformation processes in all countries require further joint efforts and financial support , and this includes the accession countries as well
However , it is the most underdeveloped countries that pose the greatest risk of instability
In my view , Mr President , this is a fresh challenge for the E@@ BR@@ D
Mr President , Mr Markov 's excellent report creates the impression that the Bank really is a great success
It has been successful at investing - in nuclear safety , for example - in the candidate countries and in the former Soviet republics
As the President said , the Bank has done a great job of improving nuclear safety in these countries
That is also something for which there is certainly a need
The fact is that all these nuclear power stations are veritable time bombs
Safety is so appalling , it is a disgrace that all these power stations were not closed down long ago
The Bank is responsible for the fund to be used for decommissioning the Ignalina power station in Lithuania
At the Copenhagen Summit , Lithuania promised to shut down Ignalina in 2009
There is really something for the Bank to do in this connection
A proposal has just been put forward for an investment package that would put some order into the method used for storing nuclear waste
The present situation is completely unacceptable
It is a huge mess and , in the longer term , extremely dangerous
I would therefore call for the package to be adopted as quickly as possible
In the future , we should take a brief look at how the Bank 's funds are monitored
I should like to call upon the Bank 's president to post something on its web site in this connection
With regard to the Bank 's accounts , it should be noted that these are not aud@@ ited by any external firm of auditors
There is apparently no independent institution that scrutin@@ ises the Bank 's activities
The Court of Auditors has not prepared a report for years
The Bank has an evaluation unit that carries out some quite excellent evaluations , but what is missing is an external audit
This bank takes an ethical approach to credit management
Its institutional commitment is to invest in any country that is inspired by democratic principles and determined to promote a market economy
In the public sector , the E@@ BR@@ D calls for the greatest transparency to be employed in order to ensure competition and equal treatment for the market players
We welcome and support the rapporteur 's views when he urges the E@@ BR@@ D to support small local banks , which , in turn , should focus on small-scale lending
small bank lending is disappearing or is being considerably cut back
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr L@@ emi@@ erre , since its creation , the E@@ BR@@ D has been a shining and undeniable example of the solidarity shown by democratic and developed societies
Although it is not officially a Community institution , the Bank embodies the entire philosophy of action that characterises the EU 's cohesion and development policies
The E@@ BR@@ D 's actions must not , however , be cannib@@ alised or cancelled out by the tasks determined and defined for the European Investment Bank
The European Parliament should , therefore , support the main conclusions offered by Mr Markov , who is responsible for this own-initiative report
Mr President , I will be very brief and will just make three comments
The first is in response to Mr Blak
We are not content with self-@@ examination
We seek an outside opinion , we have auditors , their opinions are made public and our accounts are published every year
Also , the Bank 's Board of Directors is particularly vigilant about its accounts and maintains a dialogue with the external auditors
My second comment is addressed to Mrs Schröder
Once again , the decisions have not been made and I have noted the comments
I think that it is absolutely necessary , and it is also the price of public intervention and what it should achieve if it is determined
My third comment will simply be that I have listened to all of the speeches with a great deal of interest
I think that these speeches clearly reflect the depth and strength of the institution 's mandate , but also the challenges inherent in it
Several of you have spoken , fundamentally , about the historical mandate and whether it is up to date
That leads me on to a point that is very important to us , the dialogue with all of the governments and authorities in the region
We are engaged in high-level political dialogue in each of the states in region
I would therefore like to offer Mr Markov and each of you my own most sincere thanks and those of the institution for your comments
Mr President , I apologise for taking up more time , but I did not receive an answer to my question
Has the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development transferred EUR two billion to EUR@@ A@@ TO@@ M , yes or no ?
A simple yes or no will suffice
The answer is no
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 12 noon
The omens at the start of 2003 are very sad
I want to talk again for a moment about the growing importance of the aquaculture sector
Certain fish-@@ farming activities are indeed very often seen as polluting or are thought to harm the environment
That is less and less the case , since professional fish farmers respect what are sometimes draconian European rules
Fish farmers are , then , too often the powerless victims of tragedies such as that involving the Prestige
those relating to the environment , the social sphere , the economy and governance
I shall not go into any more detail on these topics , with which everyone is very familiar
Is this utopian thinking ?
Nor shall I go into more detail about my report which , I am very happy to say , has been unanimously adopted by the Committee on Fisheries
They are not polluters
Rather , they are the victims of pollution
This disaster , which began by polluting the Galician coast , has also affected the French Atlantic coast , including that Mec@@ ca of oyster farming , the Ar@@ c@@ ach@@ on basin
It is intolerable that oyster farmers should once again be victims of inadequate maritime safety and of the dumping of hydrocarbons onto our coasts
What can be done in the short term ?
Certainly , there are already existing resources within the framework of the FIFG programmes , and a whole range of measures can be implemented
The Commissioner has replied to me on this subject
Finally , I would emphasise the importance of combating flags of convenience , as well as the need to establish a European Corps of Co@@ ast@@ guards
Even though it would be difficult to establish such a corps in the short term , its benefits would include improving the effectiveness of border controls and strengthening maritime safety
I urge the Greek Presidency to put maritime safety and the measures to be taken in the event of disaster at the top of its agenda
This report will be adopted in very sad circumstances
For all that , let us look steadfastly towards this sector of the future
It is important for the Commission to implement the recommendations in my report , particularly in relation to research and innovation
Consumers and the industry as a whole stand to benefit
Mr President , the Commission welcomes this report by Parliament
It certainly presents an accurate account of the challenges currently facing European aquaculture
The report is also consistent with guidelines contained in the communication from the Commission adopted last September
This communication concerned a strategy for the sustainable development of aquaculture in Europe
The Commission would first like to thank Parliament for its support of a range of new measures put forward as part of the Commission 's strategy
Other measures concern enhancing the governance and organisation of the industry and the development of aquaculture in general
Parliament 's report highlights the importance that should be attached to research
Mr Martin referred to this a moment ago , and the Commission 's proposal does so too
I shall deal next with the concerns expressed in Paragraphs 10 to 14 of the resolution
These relate to the possible impact of genetically modified fish and poli@@ plo@@ id molluscs
I am pleased to inform the House that the Commission has recently concluded the selection process for a study on genetic engineering in aquaculture
The study will encompass all these issues
Due consideration will be given even to the smallest
The Commission will also allow for the need to protect traditional practices
We have noted Parliament 's suggestion , in Paragraph 7 , on the advisability of amending the regulations governing the financial instrument , the FIFG
We have also noted Parliament 's view that the sector requires public financial support now and in the near future
The Commission found that some of the amendments tabled do not fall within the scope of its strategy
They will require detailed study
Further , together with several Member States , the Commission is of the opinion that aquaculture is a new activity which can and must be independent and financially viable
The introduction of measures aimed at financing its operational costs would not be consistent with this view
Furthermore , we would be severely criticised within the WTO
We have also noted Parliament 's request for a study on the viability of conserving stocks of wild fish to be undertaken
Indeed , the Commission has already requested the Committee to rule on the slaughter and transport of farm@@ ed fish
Further , within the framework of existing legislation , the Commission is launching initiatives to deal with problems affecting the market in specific species
Sea bre@@ am and bas@@ s are two current examples
The Commission 's services met with the Member States and representatives of the sector in December 2002
At that meeting we were able to come up with measures to be taken in the ensuing few months
We do not believe that the request contained in Paragraph 15 calls for additional legislative measures
There is widespread awareness of the difficulties involved in developing physi@@ co@@ chemical and biological techniques to determine the concentration of toxins in shellfish
This is also the case regarding licensing the sale of vaccines in Member States
All this is dealt with in the communication
Nonetheless , we have taken note of Parliament 's requests
Paragraphs 20 and 29 refer chiefly to the Member States and to Parliament itself , and the Commission agrees with them
There is , however , one proposal the Commission cannot support
This is contained in Paragraph 28
It would involve creating an instrument designed to offer assistance to the sector when it is struck by natural or man-made disasters
It is actually within the competence of the FIFG to authorise the temporary cessation of activity and other financial compensation
When very serious accidents occur , such as that involving the Prestige , the ad hoc reaction of the European institutions can and must be swift
The regulation providing compensation for Spanish fisheries and the Spanish shellfish and aquaculture sectors affected by fuel oil spillage from the aforementioned tanker was adopted on 20 December
That was merely a month to the day after the vessel sank
The Commission certainly endorses Parliament 's suggestion that the professional organisations need to make a greater effort to improve their image , establishing more effective channels of communication
In our view , however , this is something the professionals should undertake for themselves , although they could be eligible for support from existing provisions for public aid
We do not believe the Commission should be directly involved as requested in Paragraph 35
Lastly , the Commission has taken note of Paragraphs 27 and 32 of the resolution
These concern the recognition of producers ' organisations and the guarantee of fair standards to be applied to European and third-country producers and products
These issues call for more detailed consideration in the future
Mr President , this report contains a number of contradictions
It would appear to put business interests first , which is a very dangerous precedent because environmental and health and food safety requirements should come before any business interests
It also questions the precautionary principle , on the grounds that this principle would seem to make it more difficult for aquaculture ventures
The precautionary principle is something that we must adhere to within the European Union and it must be respected at all times
If it makes things more difficult , that is because it is a precautionary approach , it is the way we should approach aquaculture
The other questionable aspect of the report is the whole issue of wanting the Commission to promote aquaculture
I do not think that this is a good idea
A@@ qu@@ aculture gives rise to many problems
GMOs are an issue that has been raised already
Introducing genetically modified fish into aquaculture is something that is extremely dangerous and should be avoided
We also have to address the use of industrial fishing to feed aquaculture
It is quite clear that if this industry keeps growing as it is , it will soon outstrip the supply of resources from industrial fishing
Finally , on the matter of consumer confidence , I am very wary of the notion in the report that the Commission should promote consumer confidence in aquaculture
The products of aquaculture speak for themselves , and it is wild fish stocks that we should be looking at and addressing here
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , aquaculture is daily achieving greater recognition within the wider context of the fisheries sector at global and Community level
A@@ qu@@ aculture is a key ad@@ junc@@ t to the extr@@ active fisheries sector
It is , however , abundantly clear that aquaculture is beset by a range of problems
It is essential to identify all these problems and tackle them at Community level
It was therefore particularly appropriate for our Committee on Fisheries to prepare an own-initiative report on such an important and sensitive issue
The appointment of Mr Martin as rapporteur was particularly appropriate too
He has brought dedication and rigour to his hard work , managing to produce a report that obtained broad support within our committee
I am confident it will receive the same support in plenary
The report provides a comprehensive overview of the difficulties facing the broad and diverse European aquaculture sector
I would like to congratulate Mr Martin publicly on this achievement
This report should prove a god@@ send to the European Union and most certainly to Parliament
It marks a watershed in the effort to deal with the many and complex issues impacting on aquaculture , and will prove a splendid work of reference to draw upon
Thanks to this report and the earlier hearing with the sector , much light has been thrown on the specific problems
Both the present situation and future prospects are clearly detailed in the document
The interests of sensitive European maritime and fishing areas must come first
That is where fish and shellfish are produced , the ecosystem is preserved and thousands of families earn their living
They are closely connected to the latter and dependent on them
I therefore urge you to follow the course outlined in Mr Martin 's report so as to ensure that European aquaculture itself remains on the right course
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mr Martin on his own-initiative report , and on the quality of his work
He deserves special congratulations because he has succeeded in achieving unanimity within the Committee on Fisheries , and because of the standard of the hearing he so skilfully arranged
The current situation in Galicia following the accident involving the Prestige is a case in point
The aquaculture sector has been hit particularly hard
A@@ qu@@ aculture is an emerging sector within Community fisheries
Consequently , it faces many challenges and uncertainties
It needs Community support to achieve excellence in production , to innovate , and to enable the ventures to become more competitive and to operate in an environmentally friendly manner
Support is also needed to allow these enterprises to promote themselves to consumers and to create jobs in areas where they are most needed
The Community must make progress on denomin@@ ations of origin for high quality aquaculture products linked to specific loc@@ alities
A special section on the promotion of this type of product should be added to the FIFG regulations
Amongst other places , members of the Committee on Fisheries visited Scotland and Andalusia
Such visits enabled us to gain first-hand knowledge of the problems of the sector and of its potential
We were in a position to appreciate the difficulties facing producers on site
We met with salmon producers in Scotland and in Ireland , and learnt about their problems
We mar@@ velled at the skills displayed by st@@ ur@@ ge@@ on producers in Gran@@ ada
We realised the significance of the experimental farming of sea bre@@ am and bas@@ s in former Roman salt p@@ ans in the province of Cad@@ iz
We gained an understanding of the marketing problems too
Hence our belief that one of the Community 's priorities must be to identify new high quality species , and add them to the list of preferential species
The development of research at Community level , and the exchange of new practices related to these species and their farming must also be prioritised
The Socialist Group would welcome a directive providing for the regulation of organic aquaculture , and taking account of the crucial factors in this type of production
I have in mind the use of traditional methods , environmental factors , temperatures and the availability of water
Special funding should be made available to assist organic production and the promotion and sale of such products
We urge the Commission to take into account the fact that market saturation is not an issue in connection with the rearing of certain species such as tur@@ bo@@ t
This is because the farming of this species is a recent innovation , and is only just being developed
The Commission had indeed supported some new facilities for tur@@ bo@@ t farming
Even so , given the rapid increase in demand and the relative growth of the industry we believe more assistance is called for
A@@ qu@@ aculture is a fisheries sector with great potential
It must receive Community support if it is to develop in an orderly fashion
First of all I would like to congratulate Mr Martin on the excellent result
The problems and challenges surrounding aquaculture were brought to the fore well in his report
You can also tell that he did his own research and went to look at the places where this work is being done
I do have a couple of comments , however
One of aquaculture 's most significant problems is its poor image , which is the result of a lack of knowledge
We will only be able to eliminate this lack of knowledge if we have clear test data at our disposal
The European Union must therefore enable research to be carried out
Clar@@ ity will result in a better image , and this will enable the sector to solve a major problem , which it must do by means of communication
With regard to the finances , the economic viability of the sector is a significant concern in Europe
If we want to offer opportunities for long-term economic viability , we must not allow the sector to become addic@@ ted to subsidies
Self-@@ help is better
Apart from that , we do want to handle the frameworks responsibly , so we must define frameworks and preconditions ourselves
This market must be put on the right track
Regulation must be simple , clear and honest
Remo@@ ving regulatory barriers will make the market more consistent , more transparent and consequently more efficient
This provides better opportunities for competi@@ tively priced products , which will also benefit European consumers
Furthermore , consumers benefit from food safety and transparency , both of which are particularly important
It must always be possible to guarantee food safety
We must , however , remain rational in this regard and not make ridiculous demands
If something is 100 % good , it does not need to be 150 % good
Let us keep both feet on the ground
Im@@ posing excessive demands will pull the plug on small businesses , and they will not survive
I therefore call for simple regulation
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party will endorse this report
I think that aquaculture makes a positive contribution to the preservation of natural fish stocks
Nevertheless , we wish to draw attention to particular aspects and special needs that must be taken account of in this activity
This has been the case for the Galician fish farms
A@@ qu@@ aculture has a promising future
It will make it possible to maintain the supply of high quality products to the markets
It will also allow depleted fishing grounds to be re@@ stoc@@ ked
This is a new option
Additional support is required for research and the development of new products free from genetic modification
Direct cooperation with local and regional authorities must also be strengthened in order to promote aquaculture
This is particularly necessary in those areas worst affected by drastic restructuring resulting from failure to sign fishing agreements , or following the reform of the common fisheries policy
Lastly , I urge the Commission not to overlook traditional activities such as aquaculture in est@@ u@@ aries and their impact on the natural environment , much of which is protected
Broadly speaking I agree with the approach taken in the Commission 's communication on the future of aquaculture
However , from the outset let me say that aquaculture must be fully integrated into the common fisheries policy
It must be complementary to other types of fishing
Under no circumstances must it be considered as a substitution
Glob@@ ally , aquaculture is one of the fa@@ ste@@ st-@@ growing food sectors
The Irish aquaculture sector , for example , now accounts for over 30 % of total fish production , reflecting global trends
A@@ qu@@ aculture has considerable potential to support further growth in much needed jobs and economic activity , notably in coastal communities where other jobs are very hard to find
There can be no question that all future development in the sector must be on a sustainable basis
Furthermore the sector must deliver on best practice from a food safety perspective and here I disagree with my Irish colleague Mrs McKenna
A@@ qu@@ aculture is not dangerous
A@@ qu@@ aculture is a natural resource@@ -based industry which is anything but dangerous
D@@ um@@ ping of foreign fish , notably salmon , by non-EU producers has in the past put Community producers at a serious disadvantage and it is still doing so
In this context , I would ask the Commission to have another look at the public aid section in its proposed actions before coming forward with the formal proposals
As regards uti@@ fication , I take note of the Commission 's caution in relation to an agriculture directive concerning water pollution
A@@ qu@@ aculture and agriculture are totally different sectors that must be addressed separately
I submit , therefore , that we need a specific directive in relation to any potential water pollution in the aquaculture sector
Mr President , first of all , I should like to congratulate Mr Martin on this excellent report , prepared in conjunction with professional fish farmers
As the rapporteur emphasises , however , its development is conditional upon a number of precautions being taken
In the light of experience , we wish to highlight the need to increase research , because there is no question of basing this development on clearly deficient breeding systems
I also support the rapporteur in rejecting the introduction of genetically modified fish into the European Union
Products that are b@@ red are different from products that are the result of fishing
They ought therefore to be identified so that consumers are free to choose between them
The rapporteur is right to condemn the Green Paper 's failure to mention aquaculture and to emphasise the shortcomings of the Commission 's communication of September 2002
For example , the French company managed by Michel Adri@@ en from the Vend@@ ée region , which laid the foundations for the European tur@@ bo@@ t industry , had to invest FR@@ F 2
5 million each year for ten years in pure research before it succeeded in mastering the technique for re@@ producing tur@@ bo@@ t in cap@@ tivity
It is quite clear that , in such cases , public funding cannot be equated with a distortion of competition
This is a crucial issue for the future and for the way in which the sector is perceived
Strong , national and Community incentives must therefore be put in place
The import of aquaculture products that does not respect the standards imposed upon European Union producers must be absolutely forbidden , and this ban must be duly monitored
Mr President , first of all , I would like to wish everyone here in the House a happy new year
Secondly , Commissioner , I was very pleased to hear your constructive comments with regard to various studies , procedures and approaches
It seems there are still positive movements in the fisheries sector after all
For 30 years , we have failed to curb overfishing in any real way
Dem@@ and , the local employment situation , sectoral interests , scientific evidence and national interests have proved to be irreconcilable
Indeed , that is why the planned reform of the common fisheries policy turned out to be so limited in scope
Stocks are continuing to decline
For this reason , fish farming geared towards sustainability is the only sensible option for the future that I can see at present
I would like to express my thanks to Hu@@ gues Martin
His own-initiative report on aquaculture is a particularly good example of the pro-active approach adopted by members of the Committee on Fisheries when there are problems to be solved
The relevant communication from the Commission underlines the fact that Parliament can certainly take the initiative on important issues
A@@ qu@@ aculture is undoubtedly the alternative to overfishing , which has no future
In recent years , as we have heard , it has developed very positively and has created countless jobs in the European Union as well
It has become an important industry in coastal regions , offering further potential , which must be fully exploited
However , it is not a panacea
Fish farming creates similar problems to intensive animal rearing on land
these are just some of the key words
To cite only one example , the total annual discharge of waste from the Scottish fish farms is equivalent to that of a major city
I greatly welcome the operations and success of aquaculture , but I call for sensible , high-quality and sustainable fish farming
As the saying goes , the faster you climb , the harder you fall , and that will not benefit anyone , neither the coastal regions nor the consumers
I therefore greatly welcome the initiative of the Committee on Fisheries to subject aquaculture in the European Union to a thorough investigation in an own-initiative report
It also has positive effects on the labour market , and - a point which should be emphasised - not only in coastal regions
A large number of jobs depend directly or indirectly on aquaculture , both in primary production but also in many other sectors
I believe that research in this area is particularly important
The financial resources should undoubtedly be boosted here so that even better recommendations can be made
There are still many unresolved problems in aquaculture
Finally , I would like to thank the rapporteur , Mr Martin , very warmly for his very thorough investigation of this issue
We will undoubtedly have reason to continue our debate on aquaculture in future
Mr President , Commissioner , aquaculture is the fastest growing sector of world food production
There is cause for acknowledging the Commission 's proposed strategy for aquaculture and for commending the rapporteur , Mr Martin , for his work and his report
The key term is sustainable aquaculture that puts the focus upon employment , consumers and the environment
Access to clean water is an essential , but also limiting , factor when we talk about fres@@ h@@ water fish farming
This is a reason for stepping up research into increased recourse to recycling and re-use
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party is able to support the rapporteur 's and the Commission 's proposals
I come from an area in Greece with a large number of small and medium-sized fishing enterprises and have seen this for myself
This report reflects the growing importance of this sector
However , these proposals relate mainly to technical matters
By failing to address these major problems , the report leaves small producers , the public and the environment out on a limb
A@@ qu@@ aculture , like fish catching , has had its problems , from shipwrecks to infectious salmon ana@@ emia
Scotland may have some examples which can be followed , where , in the wake of ISA , fish farmers have led the way in adhering to an ISA code
This is particularly important considering that there was no EU funding for compensation or vaccination
Effective and enforceable quality assurance schemes too , such as Scottish Quality Sal@@ mon , should have a role , and this should be encouraged
There must be a resounding ' no ' to genetically modified fish
I will vote accordingly this afternoon
Mr President , I wish to start by congratulating Mr Martin on his excellent initiative , because it presents a new view of creating aquatic breeding grounds and aquaculture
As we all know , under the reform of the Common fisheries policy , the Commission has made thorough@@ -@@ going changes to management policies and to fishing fleet renewal policies
This type of measure has drastically affected the size of fishing fleets and , consequently , has reduced their activity
These are measures that are extremely fish friendly but appear to hold both fishing and those who have always lived from this activity in contempt
There are approximately 150 Community regulations on aquaculture
Mr President , Commissioner , twenty years ago aquaculture was hailed as the solution for declining fish catches
The dream was that it would also be able to provide a substantial proportion of the protein requirements of people living in the world 's famine areas
Like many dreams , however , this one came to nothing
The food conversion rate of farm@@ ed fish is low
To produce one kilogram of fish you do not need four kilograms of feed , as you do for mammals , but only one-@@ and-a-half to two kilograms
Unfortunately , a large proportion of this feed has to be made up of animal protein
Prote@@ in in fish feed comes from fishmeal , which in turn comes from industrial fish catches
These are done with a kind of n@@ yl@@ on stocking that den@@ udes entire areas
They not only catch adult fish but under@@ sized fish as well; they also process cod blood , amongst other things
There is therefore little point in talking about cod replen@@ ishment plans if you do not restra@@ in industrial fishery first
This can be done by quotas , but also by compelling purchas@@ ers of fishmeal to look for alternative raw materials such as vegetable protein or zo@@ oplan@@ k@@ ton
I appreciate that these alternative raw materials are not readily available
It is therefore very important to provide a financial stimulus for research into these alternatives and where possible to encourage it
This will be of benefit not only to cod stocks in the North Sea but also to the world 's hungry
If science can tap these alternative sources of protein , the dream for aquaculture may yet come true
That is why humble fishermen have always been unwittingly engaged in sustainable development
This is not a run@@ -of-the-@@ mill enterprise , but one of the future , entailing dignified , state@@ -of-@@ the art activities involving fish as noble as bas@@ s , bre@@ am and tur@@ bo@@ t
With obvious limits of which account has to be taken , it entails great scientific innovations and research into vaccines , genetically modified organisms and di@@ plo@@ id or tri@@ plo@@ id oy@@ sters
Certainly , fish are used to feed other fish
The amount of fish meal is therefore greater than the amount of fish produced , and there is a danger of keeping the fish meal industry going
Health problems are those involving not simply antibiotics or bacteria , but mysterious and micros@@ cop@@ ic al@@ ga@@ e such as din@@ op@@ hy@@ sis
The B@@ amb@@ i or Wal@@ t Dis@@ ney syndrome needs to be avoided , however , with its talk of fish@@ es ' well-being
Finally , with ten thousand years of catching up to do on those who work the land , consideration should perhaps be given to cultiv@@ ating the sea
Mr President , can I first of all join my colleagues in offering my sincere congratulations to Hu@@ gues Martin for his excellent report on aquaculture
Mr Martin 's report has come at a crucial time in the fisheries sector
A@@ qu@@ aculture is now expanding exponentially against a background of rising consumer demand for fish in Europe , and of course of collapsing fish stocks in the traditional marine fishery
Marine aquaculture is a vitally important supplier of fish , molluscs and shellfish with a particular emphasis on farm@@ ed salmon , the quality of which is improving all the time
The Fisheries Committee visited a fish farm at Rio Fri@@ o near Gran@@ ada in Andalusia last November where they are even producing st@@ ur@@ ge@@ on and ca@@ vi@@ ar
So we have a vast and growing aquaculture sector in the EU providing a great many jobs , often in remote rural areas with fragile economies
I believe Mr Martin sets out the parameters to achieve these objectives and I welcome his approach
This was practised more , however , as a costly and fashionable pas@@ time than as an economic activity
The sea-@@ fish rearing pon@@ ds were then greatly admired for their beauty and as a symbol of the prestige that they represented
Trac@@ es of at least 50 fish rearing pon@@ ds dating from the Roman period have been identified along the Mediterranean ri@@ m
In future , aquaculture is bound to grow
Mr Martin addresses all of this in a thorough , rigorous and intelligent way in his report , which should become the textbook for aquaculture in the European Union
from now on , we will make a distinction between before and after the Martin report
Furthermore , unlike fisheries reforms , it is an industry on which the Commission and Parliament find themselves in substantial agreement
We have therefore reached good common ground
Commissioner , one cannot declare how valuable and useful an economic sector is without then taking consistent measures to sustain it
A few problems remain , however , especially for small-scale fishing and traditional fishing
The Financial Instru@@ ment for Fisheries Guidance should include specific , targeted , fast credit facilities , or aquaculture will remain an option only for the well-off
Another objective - one which Parliament is particularly concerned with - is food safety , environmental impact and animal health
This is not just to prevent unfair competition , as one might imagine , but principally to make an effective improvement to the quality of our sustainable development
This report gives us an excellent analysis of the current state of aquaculture in the European Union and also provides us with important guidelines for the future
It is clear , therefore , that aquaculture has a great future
Nevertheless , as a consequence of recent food crises that have beset Europe , consumers have become suspicious of aquaculture
It must be stated , however , that intensive production is not necessarily synonymous with the absence of hygien@@ ic conditions
This is why we in the European Union have a set of standards for technical requirements that do not exist in other parts of the world
This means that there is a high degree of monitoring of these hygiene conditions
Nevertheless , these rules must be reinforced and improved so that our citizens view aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture-@@ produced fish with complete confidence
Mr President , I am glad that we are having a debate on this subject
It is very reassuring that so many colleagues have taken such an interest in aquaculture
This must be the best attended fisheries debate on record
It is vital that we recognise the importance of this very young and growing sector
We need to consider long-term secure employment in the sector and to ensure product availability for consumers and an environmentally sound industry
Sustainable development has to be the watchword
The report looks at the importance of food safety and hygiene and also of research into alternatives rather than antibiotics
We also need to address some of the key problems affecting the industry
The most recent has been unfair competition
The Commission has already been dealing with the issue of salmon dumping from Chile , Norway and the Far@@ o@@ e Islands and an investigation is ongoing in the Trade Directorate-General
However , I am pleased that the Commission has given salmon producers more time to provide a response
We must make sure that these unfair practices stop
I hope the Parliament will endorse this report and support aquaculture
Mr President , this has not been a very controversial subject
I have never before seen more harmony or unanimity in the House
Having gone through the trauma of the allocation of fish quotas , there is a greater awareness throughout the European Union of the scarcity of this most important resource
Wil@@ d fish stocks in the European Union are about 40 % of what our consumers in the Union need
This is therefore an ideal means of supplementing the demand
The advisers who cau@@ tioned us years ago have been listened to
The message has got across that we can exercise the necessary caution and , at the same time , make progress in increasing production
We are now producing something like 27 % of our needs from farm@@ ed fish and there is no reason why we cannot continue
People cannot look at the dwindling stocks and our failure to conserve them and say that the wide oceans out there present us with opportunities
80 % of all the stocks we know of are inside the 200@@ -@@ mile limit
So there are no stocks out there waiting to be exploited
We know little about the other 20 % , and from what we know it is a one-off
We can harvest those fish once and that 's the end of it
Fish farming offers prospects for the disadvantaged regions
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to begin by joining in the almost universal chorus of praise and congratulations for Mr Martin
He does indeed deserve to be congratulated on the quality of his report
It contains an assessment of the present and anticipates a bright future for this important activity
The potential of aquaculture as a source of employment is also emphasised
Many new jobs directly or indirectly linked to aquaculture can be created in areas where few other industries exist
I refer to those regions that are heavily dependent on fishing , be they recognised as such or not
Galicia is a case in point
There are employment opportunities in aquaculture itself and in the processing and service industries
According to data supplied by the European Commission last September , the number of people employed has risen to 80 000
The future will not be all plain sailing
It should be recognised that there are certain risks involved , such as environmental pollution , and the transmission of diseases from farm@@ ed to wild fish
It is therefore necessary to work towards achieving a healthy environment
Greater vigilance is required , as are technological improvements
Of course , all this will also serve to promote the development of aquaculture itself
More specific provision for research is called for
Parliament must urge the Commission to make this available to ensure aquaculture enterprises can benefit from the support of national and Community programmes
In addition , the relevant regulations should be amended so that aid for setting up and developing enterprises can be forthcoming
Co@@ financing of aid to facilitate the implementation of more environmentally friendly farming practices should also be possible
Commissioner , social dialogue between Member States must be promoted , with a view to introducing a code of good practice
Such a code could prevent price falls posing a threat to the sector
Mr President , allow me to mention Valen@@ t@@ ín Pa@@ z An@@ dra@@ de
He was a kind and generous native of Galicia
As they say in the local language , he was ' un gal@@ e@@ go bo e x@@ ener@@ o@@ so '
He loved his region and he loved the sea
Were he alive today he would be deeply saddened by the condition of the sea around Galicia and by how the sea has been affected by environmental disasters
We therefore do not support this verbal amendment
Mr President , in agreement with my colleagues , I would like to table an oral amendment to Amendment No 6
expressly excludes any expansion of the nuclear sector from
That is the oral amendment
We have just voted in favour of an association agreement with Lebanon
Less than a year ago , this Parliament asked for an association agreement between Europe and Israel to be broken
What are the principles according to which what was valid yesterday in the case of Israel is apparently not valid today in the case of Lebanon ?
Mr President , a few days ago , I visited our future member state , Cyprus , which is half-way between Athens and the Iraq@@ -@@ Kuwait border
Lebanon is just a stone 's throw away
This shows how important Lebanon is for us in the European Union
I therefore greatly welcome the adoption of this agreement and believe that it will contribute substantially to stabilising a country which is very significant for Europe
Its cultural diversity and its economic power , which is slowly developing once more , are important for us
Mr Posselt , on the matter of the location for the next European Parliamentary assembly , I think it is still too early
We should wait a little before taking a specific line or making decisions on this
Attempts may be made to disguise its real role , but the E@@ BR@@ D is an imperialist tool for robbing the peoples of Eastern Europe
We have therefore rejected this report
I should like to congratulate my colleague , Mr Markov on his excellent report which , moreover , has been adopted unanimously by the parliamentary committee
The E@@ BR@@ D is not connected with the European Union
Nor is it a development bank coming under the World Bank group
Its capital derives from more than 60 countries interested in the future of Central and Eastern Europe following the fall of the Berlin Wall
During the twelve years of transition , the E@@ BR@@ D has had to take up many challenges
Its president , Jacques de Lar@@ o@@ si@@ ère , appeared before the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left to report to us on its activities
Like the rapporteur , I think we have to support the bank
Indeed , even if its objective is to develop the market economy in these former Communist countries , the social , environmental and public service dimensions have not been sacrificed
The E@@ BR@@ D is not , as some might believe , the ambassador of ultra-@@ liberalism
Its mandate is to invest where other banks fear to tread
I am very pleased that the E@@ BR@@ D concentrates its activities on the development of small and medium-sized enterprises whose key role in job creation is well known
This is often un@@ reported but critical work to build up the economic capacity of countries which have been badly underdeveloped in this sector
I particularly commend the report 's call for assistance to NGOs involved in the strengthening of democracy in Belarus , Ukraine and Moldova
Consequently , it invests where other banks fear to tread
These are , in short , the reasons that have led me to support this report
These economies are extremely weak and lack the mechanisms , habits and culture of the market and of competition
The E@@ BR@@ D must continue to function as an institution that shares the spirit of solidarity and cohesion that are a collective aim of the European Union
Finally we have to examine the welfare of the fish actually farm@@ ed in the fish farms
If those issues are tackled , aquaculture can provide , as I said earlier , a good source of good food for our population as well as creating jobs
The current scale of aquaculture in Europe is demonstrated by the 1
8 million tonnes of fish , shellfish and molluscs that it produces , and by the 57 000 jobs that it provides
We must , however , overcome the crisis of confidence in aquaculture products , promoting food safety measures and modernising production technologies
It is against this backdrop that I support the Martin report
Not in order to tap into a market but as an essential contribution to food supplies
Fishing villages on the coast that have lost their old source of income will probably be happy to join in
This change is not without risks
If we do go down this road , we will need guarantees to prevent accidents and unacceptable situations
S@@ ick and de@@ formed fish in overcrowded c@@ ages in coastal zones , in other words a new type of bio-@@ industry , is something we do not want
Gene@@ tically modified fish in such c@@ ages can escape and irreversibly change all the life in the sea , for example , by wi@@ ping out any natural fish that are left
Ad@@ ding substances that have never been used before to encourage fish to grow fast and thus increase the yield may contribute to further contamination of the sea
That concludes voting time
( The sitting was suspended at 12
and resumed at 3 p
The report was to cover the European Union 's involvement in RFOs and also in international agreements on fisheries
Clearly , the Committee on Fisheries will need to draw up a second report
It is my belief that such a report will be in line with the resolution adopted here today
The Committee on Fisheries trusts that this report will serve to focus the attention of the House on issues related to fisheries
We hope that it will lead to a call for closer links and improved cooperation between the external dimension of the CFP and other Community policies
I am thinking here about policies on trade , on development aid and on foreign policy
It is abundantly clear that our own market in fish and similar products is supplied thanks to the activities of the Community 's fleet in non-Community fishing grounds
As you must know , there is a shortage of such products on our market
In addition , the presence of our fleet helps to bolster activity in areas dependent on fishing
These areas are generally underdeveloped and no other economic activity is viable there
This resolution also covers additional requirements consequent on other fundamental pillars of the European Union
The European Union undoubtedly has a very competitive fleet , notably the tuna , long@@ line and traw@@ l fleets
These operate outside Community waters and are deemed the most advanced in the world
They also pioneer the search for new fishing grounds and species
As a whole , the Community fleet has the technical capacity and processing and sales facilities to allow it to supply a market of 350 million consumers
Unlike their competitors at global level , European fishermen are no pirates
They do not fish illegally , they do not destroy local fisheries and they do not engage in social dumping
Their activities are in fact tightly controlled by the European Union through the Member States and the range of control mechanisms in place
European fishermen also comply with the requirements of fishing agreements , the national regulations of coastal states and the regulations of the relevant RFOs
Approximately 3 000 European vessels fish on the high seas or in the exclusive economic zones of other states
This represents 41 000 jobs for the Union
Eigh@@ ty-@@ three per cent of these come under the Southern Agreements
7 million tonnes , which represents 40 % of the annual catch by the Community 's fleet
You may be surprised to learn that the total value of the catch is put at EUR 6@@ 14 billion
This sum is multiplied further if account is taken of the processing industry and of economic activity in related sectors such as shipbuilding and marine engineering
The financial cost of the CFP 's external dimension is very small
It was EUR 276 million in 2000
This equ@@ alled 28 % of the total CFP budget
There is ample proof of the profitability of Community intervention in favour of this fleet
For every euro we invest as a Community in this fishery we get three back in business terms
Nonetheless , those concerned feel they do not receive adequate support from the Union
The underlying reason may be that the funds allocated to these activities by the European Commission are insufficient
A political strategy is lacking too
The European Parliament is on record as having repeatedly criticised this state of affairs
The House has urged the Commission to remedy the situation
In particular , it has recommended that the Directorate-General adjust its organisational chart to enable it to fulfil its role adequately
The sea is the neglected half of our planet , ladies and gentlemen
However , to date it has not yet been proven that sustainable management of ocean fisheries is anything but possible
What is needed is an approach focused on ecosystems and involving the reinforcement not only of scientific research but also of monitoring and surveillance measures
B@@ y-@@ catch must be reduced too and a determined effort made to combat illegal fishing
At the same time , a legal framework for protected areas must be developed
In addition , a broader view should be taken of the reasons for the depletion of resources
Fishing is not entirely to blame
S@@ pill@@ age from oil tankers also plays a part
We have the consequences of the Prestige disaster very much in the forefront of our minds at present
The Prestige is but one example of a tanker going down in our richest and most bio@@ diverse coastal waters
Then there is the discharge from vessels cleaning their tanks out at sea with impunity
No effective action has yet been taken against them
Global climate change is another contributory factor
Resources are also affected by the extensive use of substances such as fertilisers or pesticides in agriculture
These inevitably end up in the sea
It remains for me to highlight the social aspects of this type of fishing
We believe all fishermen should be guaranteed fundamental labour rights
In our view , it is for the Union to take appropriate action , such as the inclusion of a social clause in international agreements
I agree with her that this fortunate coincidence creates the need for Parliament to give further consideration to the Commission 's proposals
We believe the communication constitutes a good basis on which to launch a debate on the issue
We are fully aware of the importance of this chapter of the common fisheries policy , especially for certain regions of the European Union
Some of these fall within the scope of the CFSP and others relate to trade agreements
I would even venture to include agreements on sustainable development , notably those with developing countries
Our ongoing efforts to improve political and economic governance at a global level should not be overlooked either
Looking to the future , the Commission believes that its action should be seen as an investment in responsible fishing , and not simply as a mechanism for compensation
As for the multilateral aspect , I have noted comments in the House on the lack of human and material resources
I do not however agree with the rapporteur 's assessment of the need to revise voting arrangements within the RFOs
The European Union 's influence within these organisations is far greater than the number of votes at its disposal would suggest
The Commission recently presented an action plan to combat illegal , uncontrolled and unregulated fishing
The proposed initiatives , particularly measures 5 to 10 , seek to harmonise the control mechanisms of the RFOs
They also seek to make these systems more effective and to ensure they are in line with the principle of a multilateral approach
I was delighted that Parliament welcomed this plan so warmly
Further , the Busk report supporting this approach was adopted uno@@ p@@ posed at last November 's sitting
The European Union has committed itself to complying with all international agreements it is party to , and to ratifying the agreement reached in New York
Currently , 14 Member States are in a position to proceed to ratification
I hope everything will be in place to allow ratification to go ahead before these six months have elapsed
As you will be aware , Mr President , we have also addressed the question of the Mediterranean
The communication explains how we have taken the initiative
We plan to organise an international conference on the subject in conjunction with the incoming Italian Presidency
In principle , this will be held in Ven@@ ice in December 2003
The Commission is also concerned about the reduction of the time allowed for transposition
I am referring to Community legislation and the recommendations by RFOs
The Commission is not responsible for the unfortunate situation that no progress has been possible on this proposal
Regarding the social aspects , these are included in the Commission 's proposed objectives
They should have greater weight in future cooperative ventures
Concerning the need to increase scientific research , I would like to reiterate the Commission 's desire to implement an action plan on this
Although it has been somewhat delayed , it ought to be successfully accomplished before the end of the year
Lastly , there is the question of encouraging the establishment of joint ventures
The Council has retained the possibility of providing financial support through the FIFG for the establishment of such ventures until 2004
Support will only be available however if there is a fisheries agreement in place to lend consistency to the arrangement
On the contrary , we advocate its use , together with that of other financial instruments , in order to promote their development
I trust that together we will be able to create the motivation to guarantee the sustainability of deep-sea fishing for the benefit of all
Given that no political initiatives are being taken at Community level , the Commission is convinced that the size of the deep-sea fishing fleet will gradually decrease
This will probably not result in vessels being scrapped
Rather , the vessels are likely to operate under other flags , or the number of private fishing agreements will rise
I trust the House will endorse this assessment of the situation
This would run counter to our desire to establish a policy aimed at promoting sustainable fishing the world over
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner and congratulate Mrs Miguélez Ramos on her first-class report
Mrs Miguélez Ramos is , as you know , the senior vice-chairman of the Committee on Fisheries and is one of the most dedicated and hard-@@ working members of that committee
I think it is worth noting that the Spanish fleet has a historic tradition of distant water fishing
The involvement of European fishermen in international fisheries is of equal importance
So it is not only a good way of maintaining jobs in the sector , it is a good , profitable business for the Community economy
I commend this report to the House
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the report by Mrs Miguélez Ramos outlines a complete , lucid and intelligent framework for EU fishing in international waters
This policy must even be brought to bear on the European Union 's diplomatic efforts , particularly where its trade policy is concerned
The European Union cannot do without international fishing grounds and the agreements negotiated with third countries , in the exclusive economic zones of these same countries
Those who are sceptical and critical of this policy seem to be ignoring the evidence provided by the report
This evidence states that fishing on the high seas by the European Union fleet provides work for 40 650 workers and that the catches total 2
The financial effort from the budget of the European Union is , nevertheless , modest , since it only came to EUR 276
If EU vessels stop fishing in international waters , others would definitely take their place , without the ecological or social concerns that boats from the European Union have
The European Union must set an example in complying with international agreements and must give a decisive boost to the regulation of international fishing
Mr President , Commissioner , there are many endangered stocks world-wide
We in Scotland know how painful it is for the fishing industry when crisis conditions are reached , but we cannot solve problems in the EU by exporting them
We must seek responsible and sustainable fisheries everywhere
In this context we agree that the Commission must be resourced in a way that allows it to play a fuller role in regional fisheries organisation
We have , however , regularly expressed our concern on two issues
First , our fisheries activity at international level , and in particular any agreements reached directly with third countries , must be made compatible with our development policy
Secondly , the cost of the external dimension of the CFP is already approaching a third of its total budget
This cost is likely to increase if we are serious about fuller participation in regional fisheries organisations and about securing greater compliance with international law
It has already been said that each euro invested from public funds generates another three in business terms
In these circumstances it seems only appropriate that those vessel owners who benefit from third-country agreements should take on a fairer share of the financial burden involved
Madam President , as regards fishing in international waters we need a responsible and non-@@ exploitative approach
We cannot continue to export our problems
We need to look at the social and economic contribution we make to developing countries , and in relation to fishing agreements this leaves a lot to be desired
This is not just a Spanish problem
To my own shame my own country , Ireland , has the Atlantic Dawn , which is an exploitative vessel
Despite what has been said about European Union agreements , at least there is a certain amount of control , though they leave a lot to be desired
However , when it comes to private agreements , there is no control whatsoever
We need to look at our position as regards developing countries
I support what Mrs Attwooll has said
We cannot say one thing , and then do another
Not least , the World Wil@@ dlife Fund has been very voc@@ al in its condemnation of these deals
I am encouraged that even in this Parliament , just one month ago , over 100 Members voted against the Senegal deal
To my astonishment I even agree with my own Foreign Office , for the first time ever
Even they recognise that these deals are just not working
The report is very defensive in tone
It claims that EU fishermen ' are not pirates '
As to compliance with all the rules , that claim is distinctly at vari@@ ance with the current report from the Court of Auditors
Even if that were true - and I would not expect to see such a pu@@ er@@ ile argument - the fact must be that two wrongs do not make a right
Let us remind ourselves of what those wrongs are
These deals are causing environmental devastation to less developed countries which , in biological terms , is like setting fire to the Se@@ ren@@ ge@@ ti
This is a form of European Union imperialism and it is denying development to these third world countries which otherwise could benefit their own economies
Furthermore these deals are morally repugnant , in that they directly and indirectly cause the deaths of hundreds of indigenous black African fishermen every year
What this report asks us to do is to close our eyes , when in fact people are increasingly beginning to open their eyes
That is why we should reject this report
I suspect that there will still be a majority in favour , but be aware that people are wa@@ king up and will not tolerate these deals for very much longer
we do not want fish out of a te@@ st-@@ tu@@ be
We do not want fish only from aquaculture or a standardised packet off a supermarket shelf
We want more , even though the facts about our seas are bleak
The fish on our plates comes more and more rarely from European Union waters
The indigenous supply cannot meet European demand
This indigenous supply does not offer an adequate prospect for the future
We are therefore reliant on fishing in foreign waters , both in international waters and in the coastal zones of other states
I would like to thank you , Mrs Miguélez Ramos , as rapporteur , for taking up this issue in a detailed own-initiative report and clearly identifying the key problems
The European Union 's fisheries agreements are an important factor both for supply and employment , especially in the regions which depend on fishing
Simply rejecting a report , as has just been demanded , cannot be our objective , for we must examine these issues seriously despite all the potential contradictions
Nor must we lose sight of the fact that we have exploited our own waters to the point where the stocks are exhausted
We need only think of the reform of the common fisheries policy
It would be fatal - as one of the previous speakers has said - simply to export these problems elsewhere
However , long-term public subsidies conflict with this goal
It is absurd to justify the irresponsible exploitation of stocks in other waters with arguments based on fleet reductions and market supply in the European Union
Ultimately , our key goal must be to safeguard the sustainability of resources , both in European and foreign waters
However , in this context , we must genuinely accept responsibility , rather than simply seeking pl@@ audits in the short term
This applies especially to international waters
Here , prompt action is needed to combat illegal fishing effectively
Controls alone are not sufficient
What we need is harmonisation of sanctions at international level
This can only take place jointly and in a global framework
The sanctions must not simply be to@@ ken@@ ist
Madam President , I agree with the report by my colleague and fellow countryman Ro@@ sa Miguélez Ramos
The European Union 's real policy , however , is not in accordance with this view and nor is fishing in Community waters
The failed reform of the common fisheries policy highlighted this unfortunate situation
in Community water@@ s; we suffer (
The Commission services even lack the necessary human , budgetary and material resources
This is a situation that must be resolved as a matter of urgency
The debate is closed
The vote will take place once the afternoon debates have been concluded
The next item is a statement by the Commission on the effect of low-@@ frequency active s@@ on@@ ar on marine life
Madam President , on behalf of the Commission I should first like to thank the House for the invitation to make a statement on this matter
The Commission welcomes this opportunity to emphasise once again how much importance the Community attaches to conservation of the marine environment and the protection of its biodiversity
This importance has already been highlighted by Parliament and by the Council in the Sixth Community Environment Programme
One of the aims of this programme is to ensure that no further biodiversity is lost after 2010
C@@ et@@ aceans are a sensitive part of marine life
The Commission is keeping abreast of the current debate on the possible effects of the use of low frequency active s@@ on@@ ar on some species of ce@@ t@@ aceans
It may well be that intense tones transmitted at low frequency do disturb these creatures
More detailed research is however called for to establish just how seriously the trans@@ missions affect them
Nonetheless , the current uncertainty as to the effects of these trans@@ missions cannot be used as an excuse to avoid taking steps to deal with the matter
The Commission is of the opinion that extreme caution should be exercised in the use of this technology in view of the possible repercussions for the marine environment
Ideally , the potential repercussions should be assessed in advance
Allow me to remind you that ce@@ t@@ aceans are protected under Directive 92/@@ 43 , the Habit@@ ats Directive
One of the obligations it places on Member States is that the latter should take the necessary measures to prevent these species being disturbed
We shall now send the Member States a reminder to ensure they respond to our request
All the information received further to this appeal will be forwarded to the House by the Commission
It is hoped that more information on the possible consequences of the use of low frequency active s@@ on@@ ar for the marine environment can be obtained
Only when sound scientific information is available will it be possible to decide on the nature of the measures needed to supplement those already in place
Madam President , I wish to thank the Council of Presidents for having included this important issue in the debate , and I would also like to thank the Commissioner
It is obvious that submarines that cannot be detected with ra@@ d@@ ar are only used by those with hostile intentions
We therefore have to keep abreast of developments
This is a question , however , of what sort of technology we choose and what its price is in ecological terms
The low frequency active ra@@ d@@ ar system developed by NATO known as L@@ F@@ AS can cause whales to stray onto shores and can damage their internal organs , leading to death
High deci@@ bel and low frequency noise produced by ra@@ d@@ ar can carry for thousands of kilometres in the sea
There have been wh@@ ale deaths in the areas where the United States of America has tested the system
Au@@ top@@ sies carried out on the dead whales revealed haem@@ at@@ om@@ as in the brain and inner ear cause by extremely loud noise
The US na@@ vy itself stated in its report on the wh@@ ale deaths in the Ba@@ ham@@ as that L@@ F@@ AS had been the most likely cause of death
NATO was conducting military manoeuvres in the area involving 58 war@@ ships and six submarines from different member states of the alliance
The L@@ F@@ AS equipment produces low frequency noise at 1 000 her@@ tz and an average of 250 decibels to com@@ b the seabed from hundreds of kilometres away
The effects of loud but low frequency noise on the behaviour of whales and their internal organs are wide-ranging
The din can cause permanent damage to the ear bones , and brain and lung haem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge
The noise makes it difficult for the whales to ori@@ ent themselves , form herds , m@@ ate and find food
The US na@@ vy has carried out an evaluation of the effects of the system on the environment , but reputable American environmental organisations regard it as flawed
A federal judge last November prohibited the na@@ vy from testing the system in US territorial waters until further notice with reference to the Marine M@@ am@@ mal Protection Act
Nevertheless , the na@@ vy has a permit from a national authority to test the system for a total of 4@@ 32 hours in other se@@ aw@@ aters until August this year
Until now the na@@ vy has agreed to test their equipment a long way off from the coast , and away too from known marine mam@@ mal breeding grounds and migratory routes
The system can be used to cover up to 75 % of the world 's seas
The EU clearly has an obligation to act and ask for information on the system
Economic interests are clearly linked to the issue
Fishermen active in the EU have been concerned over the last year of the effects of ra@@ d@@ ar systems on fish stocks in their fishing grounds
Madam President , I want to thank the Commission for its statement
I look forward very much to your response
The debate is closed
The next item is debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law
It is very difficult for us to find a line here which expresses this deep concern about the situation in North Korea , yet does not escalate the conflict
After all , this is not the first time we have turned our attention to this issue
We call on the Commission to continue the provision of humanitarian aid , despite these unpleasant and unacceptable political conditions , and to help the country 's starving population
Even worse is that many of his people are ro@@ tting as political prisoners in re-@@ education camps where they are being tortured and beaten
It was also responsible for blowing up a South Korean airlin@@ er
It remains a failing and rogue state and a very dangerous one at that
It could wreak havoc on South Korea with which it technically remains at war
Consequently , the EU must tread carefully and concentrate on delivering humanitarian aid to its long-@@ suffering people
North Korea is the biggest humanitarian scandal of our time
While the ' Great Lead@@ er ' lives in the lap of luxury he is literally allowing his own people to die
More than two million people are said to have star@@ ved to death over the past few years and more than 13 million are suffering from malnutrition
Communist mis@@ rule has ensured that the malnourished people are left out in the cold and are deprived of proper medical care
In this workers ' paradise , about 200 000 people are kept imprisoned in re-@@ education camps for political reasons
What is more , China is systematically returning North Korean political refugees , knowing full well that inhumane punishment awaits the returnees
An appropriate response from the world community is seriously hindered by the nuclear game with which Kim J@@ ong@@ -@@ I@@ l is challenging the world
It is not clear whether it is possible to talk to Kim in a reasonable way
America 's attitude towards North Korea is a model of caution compared with her stance towards Iraq
As far as this nuclear threat is concerned , the European Union must fall in line with the United States - insofar as she does have a line
Weapons of mass destruction in the hands of an unpredictable dictator are a permanent threat to world peace , and this cannot therefore be tolerated
We must also focus on humanitarian aid in order to prevent human suffering from taking on even greater proportions
It is a good thing that the Commission is intending to earmark another EUR 9
The question is whether this is enough
I assume the Commission is willing to do more should it be necessary
I would appreciate confirmation of this from the Commission
North Korea has gone from bad to worse as a result of her self-imposed isolation
We must look for ways of breaking through this and putting an end to the biggest humanitarian scandal of our time
Madam President , there is currently a serious humanitarian crisis in North Korea
In bitter winter conditions , the combination of few or no energy sources and lack of food is crippling
So the Verts/ALE Group welcomes the Commission 's decision to provide EUR 9
But there is a need to reconsider fundamentally our approach to ensuring energy supplies
The Korean Energy Development Organisation , KEDO , was un@@ suited to meeting the country 's needs and infrastructure , and this situation cannot be allowed to continue
We condemned it and the European Union 's approach to the energy crisis needs to be completely overhauled
I was pleased to hear Commissioner Patten declare that the European Union will have to develop an alternative energy programme for North Korea
We welcome the Commission 's position on this , and we look forward to the development of a suitable programme
This would open up opportunities for North Korea to access funds from the IMF , the Asian Development Bank and others
Madam President , this afternoon we will be descending into one of the last dark d@@ un@@ ge@@ ons of the Cold War
On the 3@@ 8th parallel there hangs an ' iron curtain ' that is more her@@ me@@ tically sealed than the Berlin Wall ever was
Pyongyang has long tried to deny this awful reality
The testimony of those North Koreans who have managed to escape has been rejected as lies
there really are slave camps for political prisoners
Our eyes have been opened very late to the acute danger that the North Korean regime poses - to the international community as well
The immediate cause of this was Pyongyang 's recent unilateral withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty
The possible development of North Korean nuclear weapons and the clandestine sale of these weapons , including missile systems , now requires a quick response from the international community
I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to make a case for a regional diplomatic approach to the North Korean crisis
Madam President , various breaches of human rights in North Korea have been mentioned here , breaches which offend our moral sense and our concept of civilisation
This barbarous and , at the same time , grotesque regime must be contained
The contribution that Europe can make , that we can make , is only minor on the political front , I am sorry to say
Despite all the declarations and personal statements given on this , I am not at all certain that there is any guarantee of this today
I would very much like there to be , and I would very much like the Commission to be able to give us this assurance
Madam President , my colleague Chris Patten has spoken about Korea in this House more than once and he tends to refer to North Korea as a strange country
Some of you have pointed out the contradictions that exist in North Korea
The end of the Cold War took away the country 's cheap sources of oil and raw materials , and it cannot produce enough to satisfy its needs
There is a shortage of medicines , there is not enough power , etc
It is clear that we cannot continue to do things as they have been done so far
That is why , last November , the members of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation decided to suspend the delivery of heavy fuels to North Korea
Some of you have talked about grotesque governments that do not respond to the reality of the country
Therefore , following the discussions held in November in the Council , the Ministers agreed that we need to maintain our humanitarian assistance , including food aid
You have proposed that we should maintain the aid , but you also warn that we should be much more careful in monitoring it
Some of the data we are currently using could be useful to Parliament
The aid is granted im@@ partially
It is supplied to the most needy through European Union NGOs , the Red Cross and United Nations Organisations
In terms of food aid , we are currently a relatively minor donor
In 2002 , as some of you have pointed out , we supplied 23 000 tonnes of wheat worth EUR 5 million to the World Food Programme for North Korea
Last week we approved a package of emergency food aid amounting to EUR 9
It was 39 000 tonnes of cereals especially for children , in response to the appeal made in November by the World Food Programme for North Korea
With regard to this most recent request , the Commission , Italy , Norway and Switzerland are the only countries that have committed to progressing down this path
The debate is closed
The vote will take place once the afternoon debates have been concluded
Madam President , the disregard for democracy that the authorities of Equatorial Guinea have been displaying for years reached its peak during the recent elections in December
Elections from which , in the face of so much disaster and outrage , the opposition parties withdrew
In short , fraudulent and invalid elections , the results of which should not be recognised by the international community , with the European Union taking the lead
One third of the population has a life expectancy of 40 years and 57 % do not have access to drinking water
Madam President , Commissioner , we are very concerned about the human rights situation and also by the slow progress of democracy in Equatorial Guinea
The trial broke off what was slow but positive progress , which is reprehensible
We think that we should maintain a critical dialogue , seeking to make gradual progress
I am of course aware that this is not enough , but we must recognise that it took place
We trust that the next elections , the legislative elections planned in a few months ' time , will be held with more guarantees and freedom
At the same time , the political movements should avoid making speeches like those made by the four candidates who withdrew , which could lead to violence
We need to criticise what there is to criticise , but help progress to continue
The abuse of power at the expense of the people is the order of the day in Africa
When a president is elected with 97 % of the votes , the elections are un@@ sound
The so-called struggle at the ballot box , which resulted in President Obiang holding on to power , was a farce
This is exactly what we would expect from a government that for years has failed to comply with international recommendations to introduce a democratic order
The United Nations and European Union missions to observe the elections were not welcome
The secre@@ tar@@ y-general of the largest opposition party was arrested
The opposition leaders were subjected to unfair trials in the spring
Not surprisingly , all the other candidates apart from the sitting president withdrew from the elections
Equatorial Guinea is the umpteenth poverty-@@ stricken African country in which someone is cl@@ inging on to power , enriching himself , violating human rights and completely ignoring the international community
The European Union must engage vigorously in the political dialogue
Any pledge under the ninth European Development Fund is completely out of the question unless the situation improves dramatically
Even if this situation does improve , in the context of democratisation or capacity building , this regime will claim that this gives them legitimacy
This political abuse cannot be tolerated
The opposition leaders and all other political prisoners must be released immediately
The elections must be declared null and void , and new ones therefore need to be organised
There must be an international investigation into the way the oil companies operate and the president 's role in them
Democra@@ tisation is a necessary precondition for effectively counter@@ acting poverty
Poverty in African countries is not only caused by globalisation , restricted access to markets or inadequate aid
Equatorial Guinea is one of those countries in which development is stagnating because of the abuse of power
Madam President , Equatorial Guinea has unfortunately been a negative example of an African country for decades , but sadly it is not an isolated case
We must recognise quite clearly that we have a very substantial responsibility here
Of course , there are abuses of power , corruption , and dictatorial violations of any attempt at the rule of law in that country
Ethnic and political conflicts - although these are generally rooted in ethnic conflicts - are exploited in a cynical policy designed to safeguard resource supplies
We genuinely need the proposed report on the oil companies ' role
I do not endorse the call for an outright boycott and the cessation of all financial assistance
As a rule , such measures impact not on the dictators , but - if they have any impact at all - on the people of this already ben@@ igh@@ ted country
I completely agree with my Spanish colleague on this point
I believe that we must vigorously condemn the abuse of power
We must also work to ensure that the planned conference on reforming the judicial system can take place
We cannot apply European standards overnight in Equatorial Guine@@ a; this will take decades of development , which have yet to commence
These are the next steps we must take , but it would be disastrous if we now tried to run before we could walk
I therefore recommend a measured approach
Simply imposing sanctions is not a solution
The recent elections were a clear example of the fact that Mr Obiang does not want democracy or human rights in his country
The European Union has a responsibility towards democracy and human rights in Equatorial Guinea and some of its Member States have a twofold responsibility
The Commission needs to assess what is happening with oil in Equatorial Guinea
I would even ask for more , I would ask the Commission to consider reopening its office in Mal@@ ab@@ o
The United States are going to reopen their Embassy
Let us reopen our office
Madam President , The Commission shares the concern that you have expressed regarding the human rights situation in Equatorial Guinea
This deterioration casts doubt on whether President Obiang 's regime has a genuine desire for democratisation and respect for human rights
They obviously cannot be described as democratic elections
Also , the general pardon issued by President Obiang in October should be applied to all of the political opponents detained in spring 2002 and convicted in unsafe trials
Cooperation was blocked for several years , and five years ago partial cooperation began
It also establishes that providing European funds for other measures is subject to visible efforts by the Guinean Government in this area
We are therefore aiming to promote democracy and respect for human rights
The debate is closed
The vote will take place once the afternoon debates have been concluded
Madam President , unfortunately , the situation in Chechnya really has not improved , despite the efforts to persuade Russia to adopt a rational course
We have repeatedly stressed that the fight against terrorism is an entirely justified , indeed necessary , fight
We are deeply disappointed that people are being forced to return to this unsafe country and that even the expe@@ l@@ le@@ es are being forcibly repatriated
We believe that every option must be exhausted to achieve a peaceful solution here
One such option could be the referendum if it takes place under objective conditions
Reports from Chechnya are still extremely shocking to us all
Russian troops ride roughshod over the people in their fight against the rebel troops of the Republic of Chechnya
There are people there living in extraordinarily wretched conditions , both within Chechnya and outside
Those who have managed to flee are then forced to return to an area that is really impossible to live in
Crimes by the military are inadequately prosecuted , and by bringing this resolution we want to protest against this
Grozny is still extremely unsafe , which indicates that the fight against the so-called rebels in Chechnya has not yet come to an end by a long chalk
Buil@@ dings are being blown up and the people the European Parliament delegation went there to open discussions with are all lying in hospital
In that context , the best the Russians could do was to postpone the visit of the European Parliament delegation to Chechnya
In that context the OSCE is regarded as a bus@@ y@@ body whose mandate should rather not be renewed
Another bus@@ y@@ body , Mr Er@@ kel , who was the head of Médecins sans Fronti@@ ères in Dag@@ est@@ an , the territory bordering on Chechnya , has been kidnapped
No ransom has been demanded
It is therefore entirely possible that this man has been captured by the authorities themselves , as has happened in the past
I have asked the Commission and the Council about this
Fel@@ low MEPs in various other parties have highlighted this and are completely behind it
We want the Commission to make efforts to find out what has happened to Mr Er@@ kel and to see whether it would be possible to obtain his release
Anyway , the European Union must do whatever is possible from a political and community point of view , and the resolution bears witness to this
A white list for Chechen leaders , as has been proposed in an amendment , seems to us to be counterproductive , however
It is restrictive , and our group is inclined to think that the Danish government pursued a very good policy on this point
They did not need a white list
In@@ difference makes us accomplices
80 000 people have died in Chechnya since 1999
Hundreds of thousands have been made refugees
Yes , we appreciate Russian cooperation in the fight against terrorism , but that is no reason to turn a blind eye to humanitarian atrocities by both sides in Chechnya
The only way forward is negotiations for a political solution , a referendum and elections
The OSCE mission must be allowed to stay as an aid to that process , just as the Russians are in Kosovo
The Russians are trying to extradite Ah@@ med Zak@@ a@@ yev , the envoy of the Chechen president
The Danish Government refused , due to lack of evidence of his participation in criminal acts
Otherwise there is no point in having this principle of mutual recognition of national decisions within the European Union
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , this is , I believe , the third or fourth debate on Chechnya in one year
It shows how determined Parliament is not to remain silent about this war
According to reports , our Russian friends are not impressed by this type of debate and are also not impressed by the resolutions we are adopting here
I have always been taught that you must always tell your friends the truth , that you must not withhold anything
If friends keep quiet in front of each other , they are doing the wrong thing
I would like to send this message to our Russian friends
The situation in Chechnya is bad
We all know that , and the Russians must also have the courage to acknowledge it
Various fellow MEPs have already pointed this out
People disappear , people are tortured and relief workers are kidnapped
There is a real guerrilla war in progress
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is terrible
Yet the Russians are now trying to force these people to return to Chechnya
We all know that this is not a good thing to do during the winter months and is in fact impossible
The OSCE is being removed from Chechnya
The Russians evidently do not want any bus@@ y@@ bodies there
Just as they are actually preventing us from going there with a delegation
They use what I believe to be specious arguments for this in a letter to our President
The truth is that they do not have the situation in Chechnya under control at the moment and they cannot guarantee our safety
We all know that our Russian colleagues are very dissatisfied with the resolutions we are adopting
Nevertheless , the present resolution is very balanced
It is a resolution that shows that we in Parliament want a solution and that we really want to make a positive contribution to this
These crimes , which show utter contempt for human life , can never be justified and the perpetrators must be brought to justice
Nonetheless , I appeal to those affected and the Russian Government not to retali@@ ate with similar means but to seek a peaceful solution
This attack on the civil administration clearly shows that terrorists are not interested in ending the conflict
On the contrary , their aim is the permanent destabilisation of the region
I welcome the plan to hold a referendum in Chechnya in March
This is a hopeful sign towards democracy and self-determination
W@@ anting to encourage the refugees in Ingushetia to return home to Chechnya is the right approach , but it is fundamentally wrong to subject them to pressure
First , the conditions for their return must be put in place
People must feel safe , and they need housing , electricity and food
The schools must be open and healthcare must be secure
The European Union is willing to get involved here and provide humanitarian aid
The Russian Government 's decision not to extend the OSCE 's mandate is therefore even more incomprehensible
What possible political objection can there be to monitoring respect for human rights , providing aid for refugees , and supporting conflict transformation ?
None , in my view , unless it is seen as intervention in a country 's internal affairs rather than as an offer of help in a very difficult situation
Or perhaps the Russian Government thinks that accepting help would be a sign of weakness , which it cannot afford for political reasons
In my view , this would be a complete misapprehension , but it can be rectified
I accept that the Duma has a different political viewpoint from our own
However , I have a fundamental question
Baroness Ludford , we must refrain , quite categorically , from comparing National Socialism and the persecution of the Jews by the National Socialists in Germany with any other situation
Such comparisons trivialise this monstrous , state-@@ sanctioned violation of human rights , which was unique in history
Please do not make such comparisons again
Mr President , for the third time in history , a systematic attempt at genocide is taking place in Chechnya
It is being committed by the Russian colonial power in order to safeguard its strategic interests and resources
The fact that this is cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ aged as a war on terrorism - even if there is terrorism there - is simply a cynical distortion of reality
This is why it is important that there should be unfettered access to the war region so that the facts can be presented
We are currently witnessing a situation in which the Russian power is doing its utmost to ensure that this war f@@ ades from sight behind a wall of silence
First of all , the Commission has so far been unwilling to visit the region
We have discussed the matter time and again with Commissioner Nielson and urged him to visit the region
It may be that some influence has already been brought to bear behind the scenes here
Then we said that we as a Parliament wanted to visit the region
Our parliamentary delegation was then prevented from travelling to the crisis region for a variety of completely th@@ read@@ bare reasons
This was not just deplorable , to paraphrase the mild criticism voiced in the resolution before us
It was a scandal
We are supposed to have a partnership with Russia
Then a German delegation led by Nor@@ bert Bl@@ ü@@ m , the well-@@ respected former German minister , was thrown out as well
Mr President , I find this absolutely scandalous , and I think we should be speaking a clearer language here than we have done so far
We must make it clear to the Russians that this cannot continue
We want to shine light into the darkness and we want an end to this war
In this context , it is pretty scandalous that a humanitarian worker should continue to be held prisoner
I believe that double standards should be avoided
These people must also be given the benefit of visas , for it takes two to make peace
As a Dane , I should particularly like , however , to call for the two amendments to be adopted
This is the kind of situation that neither Chechen politicians nor the Member States should be able to bring about in the future
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe , quite simply , that the text we are preparing to vote on is absolutely odious and despicable
We say we are disappointed by Mr Bud@@ an@@ ov 's acqu@@ it@@ tal
We are sorry that we are not able to visit Chechnya
This visit has now been put off four times and it is two years since the European Parliament delegation was due to visit Chechnya
We are mis@@ taking , and losing sight of , all our reference points
Yet we accuse the Chechens , who are aiming at the very heart of collaboration with Moscow , of perpetrating terrorist attacks
These are not terrorist attacks
The attack was aimed at a cell of people working for the F@@ S@@ B and which was therefore a strategic target for the combatants or Chechen resistance
We have completely lost the plot
We are combining everything under the heading of terrorism
If we want to talk politics , we must do so with politicians
In this context , we are really beginning to become the accomplices of genocide
It is time that Parliament woke up
Otherwise , we shall be embarking again upon the unspeakable things such as we have seen in connection with Bosnia , Croatia and Kosovo
I think we have already paid a sufficient price for what was done there
Mr President , the conflict in Chechnya was discussed in detail on 11 September at the last European Union Summit with the Russian Federation
Unfortunately , the lack of progress towards peace forces us , once again , to focus our attention on the tragic situation that is devastating Chechnya
We are all aware that , from the point of view of security , the situation has worsened since the last Summit in Brussels
The European Union takes a strong stance against terrorism , regardless of who is responsible and what their motives are
Car bomb attacks , indiscriminate murders , kidnappings and other methods of terrorism can in no way be justified for any cause , however legitimate it may seem
This is obviously entirely valid for Chechnya , but our conviction that the fight against terrorism cannot take place at the expense of respect for human rights is also valid
First of all allow me to look specifically at the subject of human rights
Non-@@ governmental organisations of recognised standing continue to report serious violations of human rights committed in Chechnya by the security forces working on behalf of the Russian Federation
The murders , torture , disappearances and other violations of basic human rights should therefore also be clearly and strongly condemned by the European Union
What is equally serious is the lack of a clear will on the part of the authorities to deal with these violations
The result of the trial against Colon@@ el Bud@@ an@@ ov is not a positive sign , but quite the opposite
The European Union acted quickly to demand that the same thing should not happen to other similar camps , as it only leads to the suffering of the civil population
People are displaced by the violence of war and terrorism , and until those things stop , they cannot return to their homes without their lives being endangered
They should also have a minimum economic infrastructure , which they do not currently have , in order to continue with their lives
I want to assure you that the European Commission is keeping a close eye on events and that it will take the necessary steps to prevent this from being repeated
In fact , ECHO is planning a monitoring delegation to Ingushetia at the end of this month
The European Commission is aware of the majority position of Parliament on these issues , and of its efforts to achieve the shared objectives that I have just mentioned
Another very important matter is the considerable humanitarian aid provided by the European Union
Our humanitarian workers continue to face countless administrative obstacles preventing them from effectively doing their job
What is even more serious is that the bureaucratic obstacles are endangering their lives and their safety
In this context , I would like to point out that Mr Ar@@ jan Er@@ kel , an employee of Médecins sans Fronti@@ ères , was kidnapped months ago
We have urged the Russian authorities , and we repeat that request , to do everything in their power to secure his immediate release
If you will allow me , I would now like to deal with the central issue of the urgent resolution under consideration
As you are aware , on 31 December , the mandate of the OSCE assistance group for Chechnya expired
The lack of agreement on the content of the mandate for the coming year means that currently the team is being forced to take the decision to leave Chechnya
The Russian Federation has so far maintained the position that the mandate of the assistance group for Chechnya should be reduced in order to exclude any political role
This is a contradiction in terms given the highly political nature of the OSCE as an organisation for security in Europe
The Commission understands that maintaining this group is not only appropriate , but also in the interests of everyone , and especially of Russia
The same applies to the efforts made by the different bodies of the Council of Europe , which are also facing increasing obstacles to their work
Therefore , the presence and assistance of the organisations would be the only way of providing that normalisation process with a level of democratic legitimacy
We hope that these diplomatic proceedings will enable us to achieve our objective
The debate is closed
We shall now proceed to the vote
We shall now proceed to the vote on the final report on the agenda
The rapporteur has made important observations about the social , economic and environmental fields of our fisheries sector with regard to fishing in international waters
The report that we are debating warrants our full interest because it presents practical solutions to the problems afflicting fishermen
Conclu@@ ding agreements with third countries provides the EU with additional fishing resources
Through such instruments , the EU ensures work for its fishermen , resolves the problem of supply and plays its socio-economic role towards developing countries
We must conduct our external fisheries policy in a systematic and sustainable way
I would ask the Commission to present a political strategy that enhances the international dimension of the CFP
This strand of the CFP cannot be overlooked within the EU 's external policy and in its international trade policy
Lastly , I wish to take this opportunity to express my regret at the recent confrontations that took place in the Al@@ gar@@ ve between Spanish fishermen and the Portuguese maritime authorities
Spanish boats that were in Portuguese waters illegally fishing bi@@ valve molluscs were identified by the Portuguese Maritime Police
The pursuit resulted in physical confrontations and injury to one of the authority 's agents , requiring the intervention of a Portuguese na@@ vy cor@@ ve@@ t@@ te
I would add that the Spanish offenders were caught using the suc@@ tion method of fishing , which is totally prohibited in the European Union
Despite having alerted the Spanish authorities , the Portuguese government has received no reply , which does nothing for the existing good relations between the two countries
Hence our support for this report , despite the measures already taken in this field by the Council
We have reached the end of the agenda
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned
( The sitting was closed at 5
We are all aware of the importance of the activity of the Member States ' fleets in non-Community waters
The Commission still needs to clarify how it is going to secure a higher profile for the international dimension of the common fisheries policy within the Union 's external policy
It is also crucial that effective aid for the renewal of fishing fleets is maintained
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 16 January 2003
Madam President , I should like to know whether a dress code has been introduced here in Parliament
I am thinking of something that happened yesterday during a hearing concerning the Ta@@ ke@@ over Directive
I should like to know if there is a new practice in Parliament
For your information , I can point out that I am wearing neither a tie , shir@@ t nor jacket
do I have permission to be here as an MEP ?
Mr Blak , I will make inquiries into that matter
I note your upset with regard to your assistant
Regarding the balance , you are welcome to be here , but after the sitting I would be happy to recommend you a good tailor
The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy on the situation in Iraq
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as always , it is a great honour for me to take part in a sitting of the European Parliament
But although it is always a pleasure , I must tell you that today is also a moment of great concern for me
( The President cut off the speaker
Mr Solana , I apologise for interrupting your introduction
Colleagues , I think you have made your point
I would appreciate it if you would put down your plac@@ ards so that we can proceed with the debate
Mr President , do not imagine that I am so old , I am going to carry on working and pe@@ stering people for a few more years
The first is undoubtedly Iraq
I will run through the four points , although the honourable Members know them very well
we all have an interest in Iraq getting rid of weapons of mass destruction and this is something that all Europeans should agree on
One of the most serious problems we are going to face during this century is unquestionably the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
And we Europeans cannot ignore this problem , a serious problem for which a solution must be found
The second important point is Iraq 's responsibility to cooperate actively with the inspectors
The third point , which I believe is essential to point out , is that we must give all the necessary support to the inspectors
The inspectors are the eyes and ears of the international community
I believe that the international community should respond positively to these three requests from the inspectors
In other words , they should be offered resources , time and intelligence
It must be carried out within the framework of the United Nations , which is the institution which must provide the legitimacy for any action in relation to this issue
And we must make the two things compatible in the eyes of the population , of the citizens of Europe
How to make preventing armed conflicts and preventing the existence of dictators compatible is the great challenge facing the international community
As you know , a debate began today in the Security Council on the basis of the report produced by the inspection chi@@ efs 48 hours ago
Let us wait and see how that debate develops before taking a position on it
As you are aware , yesterday the President of the United States made an important speech
You also know that there will be other consultations in the coming days ?
Yesterday elections took place in Israel , and I believe we must learn at least three important lessons from these elections
It is surprising - or at least it surprises me - that in view of the situation we are facing in the Middle East electoral turn-out should be so low
It is the lowest turn-out since the 1967 elections
That is the first point to stress
The second point to stress is the enormous , and very significant , victory of Prime Minister Sharon
I would like , on behalf of all of us , to congratulate him on his victory and the victory of his party
Sharon 's victory is like none other of his previous victories
That is the demand that with respect I believe we should make of him since it has been demonstrated that a huge number of Israelis have voted for him
The third issue we should highlight and on which we must draw conclusions is the heavy defeat of the Labour Party and the defeat of the Me@@ re@@ tz Party
The two great parties , which have historically defended peace , which have been the centre of gravity in terms of peace , have suffered damage
We must analyse why this situation has come about
It will primarily be their job to do this
We have seen that the Secretary-General of the Me@@ re@@ tz Party has ten@@ dered his resignation
Ladies and gentlemen , during the short time available to me for this first speech , I would also like to make one or two comments on North Korea
Ladies and gentlemen , the situation in North Korea is serious
And we must therefore involve ourselves to some extent in the issue of North Korea
As you know , at the Copenhagen Summit an agreement was reached on relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance
We are currently working so that in March we can for the first time in history deploy a peace-keeping force in that Republic
We also want to send a clear message to the countries of the Balk@@ ans; our strategy is not to abandon the Balkans
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr President , I do not want to expand any further during this first speech
I know that the honourable Members will have plenty of questions to ask me
Force is the last resort
Diplomacy must always be our method
This is not a bad record after a century which began so badly
P@@ la@@ in@@ ly , not everything has gone so well
How can we deal with these problems ?
This was a point discussed in considerable detail in the Foreign Affairs Committee last week
Clearly , we have to mobilise the greatest international commitment and the broadest authority for what we want to do
That is why it must be sensible to base our approach in dealing with these problems on the moral and legal authority of the United Nations
I think the whole of the European Parliament would believe that it was right to try to do that
Everyone knows that , for years , Saddam Hussein has de@@ fied the authority of the United Nations over his manufacture , possession and use of weapons of mass destruction
In addition , he has an appalling record on human rights
The report illustrated clearly how Saddam normally deals with Iraqi citizens , with his neighbours and with the international community
We know , for example , that he has used chemical weapons on his own people
A team of 260 staff members from 60 countries , of whom 100 are UNM@@ O@@ V@@ IC inspectors , has been working in Iraq since 27 November 2002 under Dr B@@ li@@ x
Besides UNM@@ O@@ V@@ IC , there is also the International Atomic Energy Agency team under Dr El Bar@@ ade@@ i
Since the resumption of IAEA inspections , 139 inspections have been carried out on 10@@ 6 sites , including two presidential sites
I do not want to pronounce on the debate which is being held today in the Security Council
As I am regularly reminded , the Commission is not a Member State
We do , of course , contribute to the development of the common foreign and security policy
We deploy the instruments within our competence to make it more effective
While being clear about the limits of our role , let me however make a number of points
First , it must be plain to all that the authority of the United Nations should be a paramount consideration
The pity is that in the past we have stood by too often while the United Nations has been de@@ fied , thereby exposing ourselves to understandable charges of double standards
Second , Saddam Hussein must work with the UN inspectors under Dr B@@ li@@ x to get rid of those weapons of mass destruction for which he has not yet accounted
We should not forget the sobering comment made this week by Dr B@@ li@@ x
Third , if inspectors can disarm Saddam Hussein , that is preferable by far to any other imaginable cause of action
Any sensible person should want this crisis to be ended peacefully , if it is humanly possible to do so
It would be good for the United Nations if we could accomplish this task without casu@@ alty , collateral damage or the da@@ unting consequence of military intervention
It would also be good for Iraq , for the region and , I would argue , very good for the world
But that does rather assume that Saddam Hussein will now work with the inspectors
Unfortunately , we have little evidence even now that he has yet learned that he cannot go on def@@ ying world opinion forever
The alternative would be the sort of humiliation that would make it more difficult to assert the authority of the United Nations in future cases
I believe this to be an exceptionally serious debate and one which is going to have effects not just in this chamber but across Europe and the world
Speaking like my you@@ th@@ ful partner and friend , the High Representative , both of us have grown younger in these jobs
We could weaken partnerships between friends , exacerbate relations with the Islamic world and worsen the prospects for solving crises elsewhere , for example in the Middle East
Our ability to work together in Europe is also clearly on the line
Needless to say , the Commission will discharge its responsibilities as best it can
I was in Pyongyang with the High Representative and the Swedish Prime Minister almost two years ago
I think that we played a useful role , without exaggerating what we were capable of doing
That , I am glad to say , was the decision reached by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Monday and Tuesday
What I ask , ladies and gentlemen , is that we should respect each other 's points of view
That must be our concern@@ ; it is that for which we must work , and the United Nations is the framework within which we must do it
In 1980 , he declared war on Iran , and in 1990 he invaded Kuwait
That , too , is something we must bear in mind today
His regime uses its secret services to oppress his own people with violence , murder and terror
We have to be open to a truly peaceful solution , which must be reached through the United Nations
Ladies and gentlemen , we must also , however , keep reminding ourselves of the logic involved
The discussion we had with Dr B@@ li@@ x yesterday touched on this
Lo@@ gic cannot require the inspectors to travel the length and breadth of Iraq to look to see where something might be
On the contrary , as Mr Solana has said and as is stated in Resolution 14@@ 41 , what is required is genuinely active cooperation by the regime in Baghdad
That is what we have to insist on , ladies and gentlemen
Simply opening doors is not enough
What became of the 8 500 litres of it ?
What about the V@@ X , a toxic chemical weapon on which further development work has been done ?
I hope that Iraq will be more cooperative over the coming days and weeks
Our slogan cannot be ' right or wrong , always America
That is why we have to keep up the pressure
People have to be informed , and so we are very decidedly of the opinion that Iraq must dispose of any weapons of mass destruction that it possesses
We want to achieve this through the United Nations , and we want to achieve it by peaceful means
We must therefore say that we are in favour of a clear policy of applying pressure on the basis of the Security Council 's resolutions
War is not inevitable
Secondly , Iraq must comply seriously with the inspection requirements and I would like to thank the President for quickly accepting my proposal to hold the vide@@ o@@ conference
I believe that that should be the basis for the European course of action
I would also like to point out that Dr B@@ li@@ x also told us that between 1991 and 1998 the inspectors were at work
If they were working for eight years , why can they not work for two more months ?
Nobody understands this , and neither do they understand why President Bush is offering evidence now , two months later
We are not in favour of a new Europe , we are building a united Europe , and that is the aim of our political action
Do we have measures to deal with it ?
Has the UN considered this ?
This is an important issue , as is the economic situation , and not just that of Europe
This is not the way to build a future for humanity , and we must also declare ourselves clearly in favour of not having to face an economic disaster
Finally , Mr President , we have the right to know whether weapons of mass destruction really exist
To this end , we need more proof and more evidence and they will be obtained through continued work
The debate is not only on the timetable but on how to move forward in order to prevent war
Will such meetings become regular events ?
Or was it simply an attempt to sti@@ tch up the outcome of the Council without consulting the remaining Member States ?
When we last debated the situation in Iraq in early September , the world seemed on the brink of a unilateral military adventure led by the United States
We may be the old continent but we remember our yester@@ days rather well and our experience of war has been very different from that of the USA
In the event , the United States did go the UN route last autumn , and secured a unanimous vote for a tough Security Council resolution
The UN weapons inspectors have been read@@ mitted to Iraq and are doing a professional and thorough job
So we Liberals salute the efforts of Colin Powell , Hans B@@ li@@ x , Mo@@ hamed El@@ bar@@ ade@@ i and others for reinforcing the multilateral rule of law
Now that we are engaged on the proper path of international cooperation , we must make every effort to preserve that unity
Dr B@@ li@@ x 's report to the UN provides a damning if not yet conclusive account of Iraq 's failure to cooperate fully with the UN weapons inspectors
Saddam Hussein is required by UN resolution 14@@ 41 to tell the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth
Instead , we have seen half-@@ truths , prevarication and evasion
Dr B@@ li@@ x has opened the case for the prosecution with powerful arguments , though the evidence he has presented does not yet provide proof beyond all reasonable doubt
That is why Liberals in this House insist that the inspectors be allowed to continue their work
Dr B@@ li@@ x raises many disturbing questions in his report
Saddam Hussein clearly has a case to answer
A peaceful resolution to the crisis is still possible provided that Iraq now demonstrates a real willingness to cooperate with the UN in dis@@ arming
But equally , the international community has to stand ready to enforce its will , or the rule of law will be flouted
So let us forget talk of allowing Saddam Hussein to slip off quietly into the night for a comfortable exile in a third country
He is a war criminal and he must be brought before the International Criminal Court
And I invite them to search their consciences
Is the best way to advance the cause of peace really to travel to Baghdad for a pho@@ to opportunity and risk being manipulated by the Iraqi regime ?
Dr B@@ li@@ x told us yesterday that if Iraq chooses to cooperate , the inspectors can complete their work very soon
If Iraq does not seize this final opportunity to cooperate , we must act together through the UN to enforce resolution 14@@ 41
Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , we are on a kni@@ fe@@ -@@ edge
Mr Solana , you seem to welcome the common position of the Fifteen , or in any case of the four countries that currently sit on the Security Council
This does not merit such rejoicing
Still others are doing their utmost to find passages in Dr B@@ li@@ x 's report to take out of context in order to try to justify military intervention
Or if Mr El@@ Bar@@ ade@@ i thought it were possible , and I quote ' within the next few months to provide credible assurance that Iraq has no nuclear weapons programme '
Of course there are still grey areas that absolutely must be clarified
We will not , however , achieve this through bombs and blood
We must speak frankly and on the other hand be far more aggressive in demanding that the inspectors be allowed to take the time they need to complete their work
Be@@ ware of playing down war
Be@@ ware of gradually and insidi@@ ously accepting the unacceptable
Let us therefore review everything that Europe has accepted , with little or no reaction , from Ariel Sharon in Palestine over the past two years
He does not deserve congratulations , Mr Solana
We must resolutely fight his disastrous policy , including for the Israeli people themselves
Weapons of mass destruction must be destroyed and banned in Iraq , throughout the region , and all over the world
We must listen to public opinion
Mr Blair and Mr Aznar are isolated in their own countries over the question of war
There is an overwhelming majority against war in Germany
Four out of five French citizens are asking Paris to use the right to veto if necessary to try to prevent the worst from happening
( It sounds like Europe in 19@@ 38
without the slightest leniency towards the authorities , therefore , and within a population that has already suffered the effects of a criminal embargo for twelve years
There will be more than thirty of us
In the same vein , my group suggests sending - and will do so - a delegation to the United States
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , we run the risk today of repeating ourselves
Personally , I would like to make a suggestion
Obviously nobody here today is defending a dictator
Those who were communist no longer are , and are not defending any communist dictatorships
We should take note of this , but the problem lies elsewhere
The problem today is knowing whether we are capable of imposing international law
You are therefore advocating military intervention in the short or medium term
I am indeed saying that I , who , often against my group or other groups , have defended and still defend military intervention in Kosovo and Afghanistan
He is a blood@@ thir@@ sty dictator who is weak and who is now incapable of attacking other countries
those which act against other countries and those which do not
Who intervened to stop this blood@@ letting ?
Nobody intervened
So , let us stay calm
there was no oil
there was no oil
So let us moderate our great speeches on dictatorships , and murders , and dying children
There is a problem , however
Iran now possesses missiles
Iran is currently equipping itself with a nuclear arsenal
Iran could now attack Israel , Europe , Greece and reach these regions
Is anyone suggesting a military for@@ ay into Iran ?
Today , North Korea has said it wants to produce nuclear weapons
Is anyone suggesting military intervention ?
With the arguments developed with regard to Iraq , we are creating a programme of nuclear proliferation
We are telling dictators to possess weapons of mass destruction so that nobody attacks them
That is the truth
Fine , the Americans and the English are surrounding Iraq , so Iraq cannot move
So we have time
We can wait a year
We can say that the soldiers should stay where they are
At the same time , however , let us show the world what we are capable of
Let us solve the Israeli-Palestinian problem while still threatening Saddam Hussein
Let us change the agenda and our priorities
That said , let us not fool ourselves , if the inspectors are there now , it is because the soldiers are present
Let us take advantage of this situation , however , to contain the problem and avoid making war
At the same time , let us try to obtain negotiations with the Middle East
I believe that Ariel Sharon will form a coalition forcing him to negotiate with the Palestinians
First of all he must be forced to let the Palestinians elect their own representatives so that they can negotiate with the Israelis
Let us change the agenda
Let us find a solution to the Middle East and you will see that the Arab masses will applaud us if we have to sort out Saddam Hussein
So , ' make law , not war ' , change the agenda , give us time , stay there for a year or two
We will disarm Saddam Hussein , but first of all let us find a solution to the Middle East
Speaking time does not stretch to two years , Mr Cohn-Bendit
The question is how to deal with an undemocratic regime that has breached and continues systematically to breach its international commitments and obligations within the United Nations
This is also a regime that has imposed all kinds of constraints on its people , demonstrating total contempt for their most basic political , economic and social rights
This is not the issue , because if it were , we would clearly have to acknowledge that there are also European interests in this area
Mr President , when we criticise a policy , we must come up with alternative proposals and solutions
If they do not cooperate , they will have to face other means being used to make them do so
Mr President , we make a clear distinction between Iraq 's totalitarian regime and its people
As I said , the Iraqi people have been the main victims of the olig@@ archy governing them and which uses them to achieve its own ends
Political tor@@ ment plagued Europe in the last century
The ideologically ' legitimised ' obsession with power on the part of dictators created millions of victims
They certainly did not spare their own citizens
Is the parallel with the loathsome regime of Saddam Hussein not obvious here ?
We should therefore be talking about ' liberation ' and not ' war ' in respect of Iraq
At least that is how Saddam 's living victims see it
Sadly enough , they cannot count on the unanimous support of the Member States of the European Union in this regard
In fact the opposite is true
Today this strategy is being continued in the European desire to extend the UN inspections in Iraq
That Saddam is again flouting a compulsory Security Council resolution does not spoil the European illusion of Saddam 's total disarmament
Do the Member States of the European Union want to have this on their consciences , particularly given their own painful experiences during the last century ?
Furthermore , Iraq under Saddam remains a permanent potential threat to the entire Middle East , not least on account of her oil reserves
Des@@ per@@ ate diseases need desperate remedies , as the saying goes
War is awful , but the consequences of an overly tolerant attitude may in time cause more devastation
Recent European history should show government leaders their responsibility in this regard
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , everyone here is talking about the Iraqi crisis
There is no Iraqi crisis , but an extremely serious international crisis deliberately created by the Bush administration
It is not the dictator Saddam Hussein who is the warmon@@ ger
The warmon@@ ger is Bush , the democrat
Iraqi aircraft carriers are not manoeuvring along the coasts of New England , nor are Iraqi mar@@ ines taking up position in Mexico , Canada or Cuba
It is the Anglo-@@ American arm@@ ada that is reviving gun@@ boat diplomacy in the Middle East
Why was the alleged need to disarm Iraq not brought to light before the election of Bush junior ?
Furthermore , this is the gist of the report by one of the main UN inspectors , amongst others
Was Saddam Hussein not already a dictator when he received weapons of all kinds from the United States , Europe , France , and even Jacques Chirac ?
I am thinking of the nuclear reactor at O@@ si@@ ra@@ k which was destroyed by the Israelis in an aer@@ ial attack during peace@@ time
Please , let us not be hypocritical
Let us stop acting out humanitarian indignation
The United States , whose oil stocks will be used up in ten years ' time and which consum@@ es one quarter of the 3
Mr Solana wants to disarm Iraq and hunt down the dictators of the world
The latter point constitutes a huge programme which would oblige the United States to attack many of its allies
You have waited thirty years to discover that Saddam Hussein used poison gas against the Kurds
In terms of mass destruction , do you think that the powers in question have never used them and can therefore preach to the world about international mor@@ als ?
The primary motive for the enlargement of the European Union is that it will extend the stability zone
I think that we should make that point by incorporating this into the integrated approach
This is the road we must take , rather than following others on their celebr@@ atory pro@@ c@@ essions , whether these be to Baghdad or to Washington
It must , however , be made clear that this must be kept up to the very end
This is a consensus that does not just last for eight days , but one that must be made to work
It seems to me that something of a credibility gap is developing here , one that may cause a great deal of damage in days to come
It should not , however , be forgotten , when considering this issue , that Saddam Hussein is a mass murderer
The depic@@ tion of Saddam Hussein as someone who represents no real danger does not strike me as credible
We should also be stating what is to happen once the war is over
What form is political reconstruction to take ?
For how long will Western troops have to remain there ?
For the right to self-defence presupposes not merely the possibility of an attack , but that an attack is actually happening or is imminent
' Any security strategy committing itself to preventive warfare is in defiance both of Catholic teaching and of international law
These quo@@ tations are from the statement on the Iraq conflict issued , on 20 January of this year , by the Conference of German B@@ ishops
President K@@ was@@ ni@@ e@@ w@@ ski of Poland said in an interview last week , ' If it is President Bush 's vision , it is mine
Mr President , Mr Solana and Mr Kinnock , it is very good that we are having this debate
It is a very complex issue , and developments are taking place so quickly that the situation is changing almost from one day to the next
This means that any resolution becomes obsolete extremely quickly
The Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party really appreciates the efforts you are making , Mr Solana , towards uniting the EU around a single policy
It is no easy task
At the same time , it is very clear that the EU is not united
In all facets of the Iraq issue we have heard differing views from different capital cities
I dare say that it has never before been so evident that the EU has failed in developing a common foreign and security policy
For all the fine words and the rhetoric , we stand emp@@ ty-@@ hande@@ d; which is terribly tragic
What should be done with Saddam Hussein ?
How could peace , freedom , democracy and human rights be guaranteed for the people of Iraq , who have suffered for so long ?
It goes without saying that we all hope that a war can be avoided
It is obvious that the inspectors , under the leadership of Hans B@@ li@@ x and Mo@@ hamed El@@ Bar@@ ade@@ i , need more time
Iraq and Saddam Hussein are playing games with us; one cannot help feeling that they have something to hide
Iraq must pull itself together
It is Iraq 's own responsibility , not that of the UN , to prove that there are no weapons of mass destruction in the country
Our view is that the inspectors need more time , a view expressed by many others here
Any decisions on a military strike , which might unfortunately be necessary , must be taken by the UN
Lastly , I must express my regret that individual MEPs are going to Baghdad on their own initiative
Instead , they run the risk of becoming his hostages and getting in the way of the work of the inspectors
It is of course up to individuals whether or not they decide to travel , but the European Parliament is in danger of looking extremely ridiculous on the international stage
I would advise strongly against making this journey
Mr President , I too am inclined to think that we should take a little look back in time
Who was it really that created Saddam Hussein ?
It was the United States , and they used him in the war against Iran
When Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons of mass destruction against his own people , the United States was informed of the fact
An American attack on Iraq would not only be an attack on an individual country
It would be an attack on international law and upon the whole UN system
I think that Great Britain and Spain , specifically , should be called upon to show that they too join with the EU in rejecting war
It would not of course be a war to disarm Iraq and introduce democracy there
Is it at all conceivable that the United States would install a Shi@@ a Muslim government in Iraq , reminiscent of the government in neighbouring Iran ?
Is that within the bounds of possibility ?
Could one imagine the United States allowing the Kurds their independence ?
Certainly , not much importance can be attached , then , to the talk of democracy
If the intention is to disarm Iraq , then that is the role assigned - rightly - to the weapons inspectors
If the desire is to disarm Iraq , it is a question of supporting the work being done by the weapons inspectors and Hans B@@ li@@ x
In that way , it would be possible to strengthen the Iraqi people and the democratic forces in Iraq , as well as democracy and peace for all of us
We also have another task
In conclusion , I want to state that we must urge Saddam Hussein to cooperate with the weapons inspectors so that we avoid a war
I believe that the way forward is through democracy , development and cooperation
A pre-emptive attack like this would set a new international precedent that has no basis in the United Nations Charter
Such a war on Iraq would be immoral , unjustifiable and illegal
It would make the world a much more dangerous place , causing more resentment and fuelling more terrorism
There is already a humanitarian crisis in Iraq and now the people are being threatened again
Britain has already announced the deployment of some 30 ,000 troops and the United States 130 ,000 troops which are being mobilised in readiness to attack
Those of us elected by the people in Europe can speak in this Parliament on behalf of so many of them who are saying no to war
I have received many letters from Wales and from other countries asking the European Parliament to do everything that it can to try and stop this war
Pe@@ aceful means of solving the problems have not been properly explored , let alone exhausted
Mr President , all statements - from any government or any government representative - seeking to point out differences between positions or diplomatic shortcomings are unwise
Diplomacy should have led us in Europe to formulate joint or , at least , homogeneous positions
Mr President , no one should be in any doubt that I shall celebrate on the day that Saddam Hussein 's regime of terror comes to an end
I do not , however , believe for one moment that a war is the correct solution to the problem
President Bush believes in absolute good and absolute evil
I , for my part , do not
Of course Iraq must comply with the UN resolutions
So must Israel too , moreover , and I anxiously await the relevant demands on the part of the United States and the EU
Let us not forget that the United States was once an enthusiastic supporter of Saddam Hussein and supplied him with some of his conventional weapons
Iraq does not constitute any immediate threat , either to its neighbours or to the global community
A war , on the other hand , could have completely unpredictable consequences
It would fuel increased hatred towards the United States and the West and create a breeding ground for further terrorism
The same applies to the sanctions against Iraq , which have merely made it easier for Saddam to oppress his people
That would be a far-sighted and long-term solution
War would be a short-sighted and anything but long-term solution
Mr President , High Representative , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , everyone seems to be for peace , saying ' No to war '
Can you see anyone saying ' Yes to war ' ?
Everyone - the Pope , the anti@@ po@@ pe , the communists , the fascists , everyone - is saying ' No to war '
What is the alternative to ' No to war ' , however ?
Specifically , it is the risk of war breaking out - which you have mentioned - in 15 , 20 or 30 days ' time
Later on , however , after 20 days , will there be a different strategy ?
What will Europe propose ?
The alternative to the destruction we call war - how do we , how do you see it ?
peace is what we have at the moment
That is his opinion
We all know the sorts of things that Mr Le Pen can say and the mean@@ ings that can be inf@@ erred
I can see some logic in all this
We radicals have presented a proposal
In the space of four days , we have received approval from 66 countries
What proposal are we now submitting to you too ?
It is not a question of changing the dictator but of changing the regime
This is our proposal , and may the others rest in eternal peace
And it does not take any great feat of memory to conclude that the only language the Iraqi Government understands from the international community is firmness
This is not pacif@@ ism , it is demagoguery and irresponsibility
In order to be credible , the European Union must be prepared to make its contribution to guaranteeing and preserving international peace and security
The inspectors ' reports to the Security Council are conclusive in terms of the non-compliance with Resolution 14@@ 41
The Iraqi regime today has a new opportun@@ ity; let us pray that it takes that opportunity and that we can all prevent anything worse from happening
And periodically , by means of democratic elections , the citizens will judge whether the governments , and also the oppositions , have made the right decisions
Mr President , 72 % of my compatriots are against a war in Iraq
They have not yet seen any convincing evidence
They are concerned about the human suffering , the increasing South-@@ North divide that will increase hatred amongst people and hinder democratisation and solutions in the Middle East
In a world in which oil prices are rising and the chance of peace is falling , it is the developing countries with no oil that are the main victims
The gap will grow
The international coalition against international terrorism is being undermined
Europeans are not at all convinced
Germany , Britain , France and Spain must all listen to their people and not to the fundamentalist Con@@ do@@ lee@@ zza R@@ ice and Paul Wol@@ f@@ ow@@ itz in George Bush 's circle
There have fortunately been many protests from the American people , and a large number of Democrats have rejected the logic of inevitable war
We are looking for allies among the American people , the majority of whom are not in favour of a unilateral war
We reject the logic of inevitable war
The power of a united Security Council must bring Saddam to his knees , and we must take time to do that
We have the time , Saddam does not
A war without convincing evidence or a UN resolution would be an admission of weakness and would really play into the hands of the S@@ add@@ ams of this world
Let us Europeans , via you , Mr Solana , the 15 Member States and the Security Council , build on our European peoples ' desire for peace
That is true wisdom
Mr President , resolution 14@@ 41 is very clear
It declares in paragraph 1 that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under the relevant resolutions including resolution 6@@ 87 of 1991
It imposes sanctions , except as regards medical and humanitarian supplies , to ensure compliance
It places a clear prohibition on the commission of , or support for , acts of terrorism
It demands the restoration of Ku@@ wait@@ i prisoners of war and Ku@@ wait@@ i property and it war@@ ns of grave consequences which would follow Iraq 's continued use of weapons of mass destruction
Iraq is indeed guilty and in breach on all those counts
For example , it supports terrorists such as the M@@ K@@ O , pros@@ cri@@ bed on the European Union list of terrorists
It trains , arms and sends out that terrorist group and has done so for a long time now
Pos@@ sibly also , through war in the north of Iraq , we are discovering its links with the Al Q@@ ai@@ da network of international terrorists
I turn to weapons of mass destruction
I have talked in earlier debates of the use of mu@@ st@@ ard gas in the marshes in 1996 and of the victims I saw
Despite these breaches , resolution 14@@ 41 gives Iraq one final chance , a sl@@ ender window of opportunity that it seems to be refusing to open
Resolution 14@@ 41 calls us also to witness and to relieve the sufferings of the Iraqi people
The resolution points to the prolong@@ ation of the crisis of humanitarian dimensions as the consequence of Iraq 's refusal to implement resolution 6@@ 87 and others
What are the consequences ?
Iran has borne a major burden , Jordan has large numbers , Syria enormous numbers too and Turkey also , not to mention other countries in the region
We have a relatively small number in the European Union
Hundreds of thousands , yes , but not the four and a half million that are in the region
These refugees are ali@@ ve; others have been tortured , killed or imprisoned and have no freedom of speech
Saddam is indeed dangerous to the region and beyond , and dangerous to his own people
That is the threat he poses to the region , and he has instruments which will allow him to put those weapons of mass destruction beyond Iraq 's national borders
Resolution 6@@ 87 had an overall objective of restoring international peace and security in the region
I believe that the United Nations ' will is now to secure that goal
Our unity as a European Union should be deployed in support of their efforts
The problem is that the decision to bomb Iraq into a mor@@ gue un@@ fit for the dead was taken a long time ago on the Po@@ tom@@ a@@ c
People all over the world have understood this and are angry and are mobilising against it
It is all very well to say that we must announce the role of the United Nations
Regarding solid evidence , we do not know for sure if this bloody dictator still has these awful weapons and neither does Dr B@@ li@@ x
If this were a criminal case , it would be thrown out of any court in this world
This , we must say , probably for the last time , is a defining moment for Europe
This Union must reclaim the moral and rational initiative and , first of all , save itself from some of its leaders
Mr President , Mr Solana , at this stage in the debate , it is difficult not to repeat what other Members have already said
I hope that we will vote tomorrow on a joint resolution tabled by several political groups , as well as on a number of amendments
why , in the fifteen countries of the Union , are we seeing such a vehe@@ ment rejection of war ?
The reasons have already been partly cited
First of all , there are no determining facts to explain why Iraq might be more dangerous today than two years ago
we need to defend other priorities
Naturally , it is easier said than done and it depends a great deal on the Arab , Per@@ sian and Turkish societies in the region
We also have our share of responsibility , however
I would like to return to the matter of the embargo to conclude
The embargo is helping the dictatorship
It is killing the Iraqi people
I believe this message must be stated more firmly and should be conveyed through the appropriate diplomatic channels
Mr President , we all agree that Saddam Hussein is a danger to his own people
But many of the people protesting throughout the European Union and throughout the world , and making their voice heard , consider that George W
Bush is a threat not to his own people but rather to the world at large
There is no justification for this war in my opinion or in the opinion of the protestors
I repeat yet again that there is no evidence whatsoever of a link between Al Q@@ ai@@ da and Iraq
Washington 's claims are based on Al Q@@ ai@@ da prisoners in Guantanamo Bay
We all know what those prisoners are suffering
There was never for one moment any doubt in my mind that the United States has been ang@@ ling for war in Iraq
7 million citizens have died as a result of sanctions and bombings since the Gulf War makes one wonder how much a barrel of oil is worth
Make no mistake , this war is about oil
We are told by the United States that the oil reserves after the war will be used exclusively for Iraqi reconstruction
pull my other leg
The European Union is footing that particular bill
Society in Afghanistan remains as fr@@ actu@@ red as ever
In my view , the United Nations Security Council has primary responsibility under the UN Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security
Without the agreement of the UN Security Council , this war would be a breach of international law , would have no legitimacy and would be wholly immoral
More than 80 % of European people are against war in Iraq
Yet they are ignored by American and British leaders who are busy sending troops in preparation for the war
I believe that , after Iraq , the Americans will move on to Iran and the other elements of the axis of evil
May God helps us all
Mr President , there is essentially nothing surprising about the situation today
Nor is it surprising that they need to invent pretexts
Nor is it surprising that Europe , in the face of this , is ludicr@@ ously divided
Nor is it surprising that France , in Europe and throughout the world , symbolises resistance to imperial terrorism
It needs wars for various reasons , for oil , naturally , since oil is so very necessary to Bush 's oil consortium , but also for economic reasons
The American economy , as we are forever being told , is on hold and this situation is decidedly bad for growth
In this cruel system , the boost to the economy comes at the price of several hundred thousand deaths
Nor should we be surprised at Washington 's pathetic need to disguise its crimes
He wrote quite simply that Saddam Hussein cannot have kept the slightest usable chemical weapons programme after the first inspection mission
I do not have time to explore the other points , but it is also un@@ surprising that Europe is divided
Some Member States feel more like members of the federation of the United States than of the European Union
One example of which , but not the only one , is the United Kingdom , the reason for whose membership of the European Union is hard to fa@@ thom
Then there are others who , like France , retain the idea of a world organised into nations
Munich remains in all our memories
For now , however , the observation that we must make following the inspectors ' report is that Iraq has not clearly refused to implement resolution 14@@ 41
Until now , however , no proof has been provided , whereas substantial grey areas remain
In the current conditions , Mr President , the cure would therefore be worse than the disease
Mr President , today 's debate is probably the most important of all the debates in which I have had the honour of taking part since entering this House
If this proof is provided , I have no doubt that the United Nations Security Council will not fail to draw the appropriate conclusions
That is the essence of the proposal for a resolution by our political group and the joint resolution that will be presented tomorrow
This is a possible compromise , but I believe it to be inadequate
The doctrine of a preventive war to protect the vital interests of the United States is unacceptable
The Pope has said this and felt obliged to condemn such a doctrine because it contravenes international law and the United Nations Charter
This doctrine should , therefore , be expressly criticised and rejected by the European Parliament
I am saying this on the day following Ariel Sharon 's victory in the Israeli elections , which will , in my opinion , have tragic consequences for Israel
I very much hope that I am mistaken , because I consider myself to be a friend of the Israeli people
Yesterday 's speech by George Bush was once again extremely arrogant and without any real foundation
He clearly wants war at any cost , for reasons of his own and to protect the interests of the United States
We , and I , as a Member of the European Parliament , are proud of the ' old ' Europe
All the European governments , in my opinion , especially those of the Fifteen , should uphold this position
The European Union 's famous common position is basically a manifesto for war; that much is clear from the fact that Blair has signed it
If the European Union were against war with Iraq , it would exercise its veto in the Security Council
Its Member States would not be sending fri@@ gates to the Gulf and would not be accommodating US demands
They would be abiding by the principle of the UN , which prec@@ l@@ udes military action except in self-defence , which does not apply here
The European Union is therefore merely stalling for time so that it can finish haggling with the USA for control of Iraq 's oil fields
This is what this is really about , if the truth be told
If Iraq had no black gold , frankly no one would give a dam@@ n
Its supposed weapons of mass destruction are just a pretext
We Communists have no time for Saddam Hussein 's bloody dictatorship
We have a score to settle with him because our thousands of Iraqi comrades were his first victims
However , whether or not he should remain in power is a question only the Iraqi people can answer and it is our duty to offer them active political solidarity
Just as in the last war and during the embargo on Iraq , this war will have disastrous consequences for the long-@@ suffering Iraqi people
And as things now stand , it will have dramatic consequences - including economic consequences - closer to home
What we must call for , therefore , is for this criminal war to be averted at all costs , with or without a UN resolution
No to any move to accommodate the s@@ ab@@ re-@@ r@@ att@@ ling president of the United States acting as the mouthpiece of multinational interests
We must express our solidarity with the American people , more and more of whom are raising their voices in protest against this war
Mr President , some time ago , Scott R@@ it@@ ter , the former weapons inspector , paid a visit to the European Parliament
He asked us to travel to Iraq to support the weapons inspections
We are for peace because we are against the use of the death penalty
Within the EU , we do not permit the death penalty for individuals even in the case of the worst of criminals
Ladies and gentlemen , we have to have an international legal system and not revert to a cross between the Middle Ages and the Wil@@ d West
What will we do if , in the future , a country such as China or Russia decides it has the right to invade one of its neighbours ?
Is Iraq really the most dangerous threat or is Korea not evidence of the existence of greater threats ?
I welcome the Franco-German cooperation , although I do not support all the positions
A preventive war is nothing other than a deliberate and unilateral attack , something for which there is no justification in the absence of a UN mandate
There are many who would be the losers in such a war
The USA and Great Britain may perhaps be able to win the battles , but there is much more at stake
The starting point in this whole debate must be that we are representatives of democratic nations
Saddam Hussein is a dictator who has no respect for democracy , for the rule of law or for the demands of the United Nations itself
This issue is not simply about the work of UN inspec@@ tor@@ s; rather , it is about dis@@ arming Saddam Hussein of his weapons of mass destruction
These weapons were there when the inspectors had to leave in 1999 - where are they now ?
the burden of proof here must be with Saddam
In my view , the British Prime Minister has a special responsibility to explain clearly the reasons why we must confront the threat from Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction
In the United Kingdom we have seen during the course of the last fortnight or so very clear instances of the existence of that real threat
It would also leave the United States itself , and the United Nations particularly , weak and impo@@ tent
Clearly , should the situation not improve in the weeks ahead , a second UN resolution may be required
That is , however , the optimum option ahead of any military engagement in the Gulf
In the days and weeks ahead , we need steady ner@@ ves and an effective United Nations
We must ensure Saddam Hussein understands that his failure to comply with the will of the international community will result in serious consequences
It is not the other way round
It is also worth remembering exactly what resolution 14@@ 41 actually says
Paragraph 1 states that Iraq is in material breach of its obligations under UN resolutions
Paragraph 4 states that false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq 's obligations
Finally , Paragraph 13 recalls that the Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations
Given Hans B@@ li@@ x 's report , it could be argued that Paragraph 4 has already been breached
Whatever is the case , the UN has to decide what it means by Paragraph 13 and by serious consequences
Colleagues who have spoken are right that the future of the UN is at stake
The UN cannot make threats without being prepared to carry them out
The inspectors need more time and we need more information from the Americans
But if further serious breaches are reported , resolution 14@@ 41 has to be followed through
No member of the Security Council should prejudge that deb@@ ate; nor should they say now how they are going to vote before they see the evidence
Mr President , everybody knows that we are currently on the brink of disaster
Who can seriously believe for one second that the United States want to oppose a terrorist dictatorship because it fails to respect UN decisions ?
That is the choice
This war smells of oil , and the majority in this House knows it
With or without the UN , this war is not ours
Mr President , it is vitally important that the European Parliament sends a very clear message that there is no case for military action in Iraq
Increasing numbers of people across the EU recognise that such a pre-emptive attack would be both illegal and immoral
Hundreds of thousands of people have gathered for anti-@@ war demonstrations across the European Union
In the United Kingdom , over 160 000 people have signed a petition against war organised by a national newspaper , the Daily Mir@@ ror
They recognise that you cannot say you are upholding international law by breaking international law
They know that a war against Iraq would also be hugely counter-productive - far from fighting terrorism , it is a su@@ re-@@ fire way to fuel terrorism
There are alternatives and the EU has a key role to play in promoting them
If this conflict is really about getting rid of weapons of mass destruction , there are many other routes we can take
We need full implementation , for example , of the Nuclear Non-@@ Pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation Treaty
Five countries , including Britain , France and the United States , have been in material breach of this particular article of international law for over three decades
The chemical and biological conventions could also be strengthened
There are many other proposals
There are ambitious and controversial agendas , but the EU is uniquely able to propose radical new solutions and it has a duty to do so
Now the ball is in the Iraqi dictator 's court
It is now up to Saddam Hussein to prove to the world that he does not have prohibited weapons
If he genuinely wants to prevent war , he must tell the inspectors the truth
' On 7@@ th of December , 2002 , Iraq submitted a declaration of some 12 ,000 pages ? ? the Security Council
The same applies to nerve gas
there is a discrepancy of 6 500 bombs
6 500 chemical bombs remain un@@ accounted for
Then Iraq has declared that it produced about 8 500 litres of anthrax , which it states it unilaterally destroyed in the summer of 1991
Iraq - the report continues - has provided little evidence for this production and no convincing evidence for its destruction
There are strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared
The report continues in this vein
Today , I am pleased to say , Saddam Hussein is isolated
The pressure on Saddam Hussein must be intensified
I am therefore appealing to the Members of the European Parliament who are thinking of going to Iraq to give up their plan
Saddam Hussein would use their mission to claim that Europe is divided and that he has some supporters in our continent
This exploitation must be avoided at all costs
Whether we choose war or peace now depends first and foremost on the decisions Saddam Hussein makes , and Europe must ensure that the Iraqi regime cooper@@ ates with the inspectors
In this extremely problematic situation , Europe 's duty is to use its influence to further peace
By speaking with one voice , Europe has persuaded the United States to accept the postponement of war and has given the inspectors more influence
It is not just the United States which suffered - each one of us has been affected
In short , it is he who will be responsible for what happens in the coming months
Mr President , the High Representative started his speech this evening by saying that we must tackle this crisis from a European perspective
I believe that Parliament will have no difficulty in supporting you , Mr Solana , on the four points you cited as European strategy
In this regard , I would like to end with a question
Then , what will Italy - the subject of such e@@ ul@@ o@@ gies from Mr Tajani - do when it has the Presidency ?
Mr President , the tw@@ isted war mentality that the US administration has developed is extremely serious and warrants the increasing opposition of world public opinion
We must also ensure that the embargo on Iraq is ended , an embargo that has caused so much harm to the population , particularly to children
There are sufficient indications , my good sir , that Saddam Hussein is also pulling the strings of international terrorism and supplying it with funds
Nor do I see it as legitimate to speak in terms of the USA and the international community , which includes the European Union , applying double standards here
D@@ ouble standards are not being applied , and asking where all the raids are to be carried out is actually out of order
If Saddam Hussein has nothing to hide , why then does he not put his cards on the table ?
Why does he not allow his scientists to give information without them having min@@ ders present ?
There is no getting away from the need for us to speak as one on this issue
We support every conceivable peaceful step towards dis@@ arming Iraq and getting it to cooperate
We see action by the UN as having priority , and regard Iraq 's build-up of roc@@ kets as a de facto breach of the UN resolutions
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to put four questions to this Chamber
The photo@@ grap@@ h was taken at a time when Mr Rumsfeld was President Re@@ ag@@ an 's special envoy for relations with the Middle East
Might it be the case that , at that time , Mr Rumsfeld discussed the supply of armaments ?
Let me put another question
Why will the American administration provide evidence only after 5 February ?
My third question is this
Mrs Stenzel said that the measures needed to deal with North Korea were different from those that are appropriate to Iraq
Here is one state , North Korea , which announces that it is building atomic weapons
So the United States of America says , ' We shall negotiate with you
Where is the logic in that , if that is not purely arbitrary ?
Let me put my last question
If you can answer all these questions in the negative , then you can count yourselves lucky
We are all for peace , we are all against war , we are all against weapons of mass destruction
It is irresponsible to make out that the world is divided into those who are for and those who are against peace
The civilised world , all civilised people , all people aware of their own dignity , are against war
That is why I am asking you all not to draw a line through Parliament , for the distinction would , in this case , be purely for manipul@@ ative ends
We can show our gratitude towards the US in many ways , just as the US can show its support for Europe by not exporting ego@@ tis@@ tical , blin@@ kered economic short-sightedness
It is in the common interest , the interest of both Europe and the United States , to have the closest possible relationship with Russia
It was a wise move to include it in the N@@ ato Council , and we must continue this forward-looking process and involve Russia in world decision-making
The situation is responding perfectly to the US treatment , and armed conflict may well be avoided , if Iraq creates the necessary conditions for peace
We must strive to discern Europe 's role , on every question , not just Iraq
Our culture will have to face immense challenges in the future , and it will win through if it is fully aware of its responsibility to mankind
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , America is afraid
It has been afraid since 11 September
It has waged war on every continent
It has little experience of war on its own so@@ il@@ ; the last time was in the 18@@ 60s
Therefore it is afraid , and when a country or a continent is afraid , it can make stupid mistakes
Let America listen to her
We know the Americans are the strongest
We are forced to take note of it
That is no reason to be unilateral
That is no reason to stand firm on your own national interests alone
It must be said that our fellow citizens can detect a strong smell of oil in this matter
These are world stocks for everyone , and first of all also for those countries
Lastly , a final word to young Europe , our Europe , this young girl that we are creating
This will be her hour of truth and we must harmonise the positions of her four Member States and one candidate country that are on the Security Council
What took place on Monday is not enough
In any case , there is no clear reason to give up , whether with regard to the meeting or the right of veto
Mr President , the United Nations inspectors in Iraq are doing a good job
If they find undeclared chemical or biological weapons , they have the right to destroy them
If they do not find any , their duty is to pass on this information
While this process is underway and provided that it produces the anticipated result , Iraq does not represent a threat to anyone
In its current situation , it would not even dare to set off a fi@@ rec@@ r@@ ack@@ er
There is therefore no reason to instigate a pre-emptive war
In the next few days , the States of the European Union therefore have a pressing duty to prevent unilateral military action in defiance of international law
Resolution 14@@ 41 excludes automatic recourse to the use of force
It is a shame , therefore , that the ladies and gentlemen of the PPE-DE should have chosen to be ambiguous on this fundamental point
I do not think the bishops have been manipulated by Saddam Hussein
The socialists cannot express better than the bishops what they think of the war cries from the Washington ha@@ w@@ ks
Mr President , the international political climate is stormy , to say the least
To mis@@ quote T@@ ol@@ sto@@ y , it is no exaggeration to say that what we face is no more and no less than the dilemma of war or peace
In other words what some people see as the dilemma , that is , should Saddam Hussein stay or go , is beside the point
We are basically in the aftermath of a crisis which started back in 1979 with the Iran@@ -@@ Iraq war , continued with Kuwait , and is still going on today
Former allies are now ad@@ versaries and former ad@@ versaries are now allies
As the European Union , we need to act on one principle and one political commitment
The principle being that every decision must be passed by the UN Security Council and the political commitment being that we must all stand united at the UN
Last Monday , the General Affairs Council started by defining the capabilities of the European Union; let us hope that these capabilities finally translate into policy
We often say , when discussing Euro-@@ American affairs , that the Americans are our allies
Yes , they are and , as such , we supported and helped them in Afghanistan
But every American policy does not automatically have to become European policy
Let me ask you one simple question
Therefore , the political autonomy of the European Union and the principles which underpin it must always be the cornerstone of mutual respect between America and Europe
We need to answer a number of questions about crisis management
You remember what we said about the crisis in the Middle East ?
And nobody listened to us
There is the issue of democracy in the Gulf , in Iraq and elsewhere , but this is not the time to go into that
They came about by backing off and improving relations and by paving the way for these countries and nations to move towards democracy
Mr President , High Representative , almost everything has been said today
I would like to welcome the efforts of the Greek Presidency to resolve the situation we find ourselves in
The European Parliament will perhaps adopt a common resolution tomorrow on Iraq , a resolution which I support
But I am appalled that the minimal consensus it reflects , which underlines the central role of the United Nations Security Council , is so timid
Although defence and security are clearly intergovernmental matters , I believe that world peace and stability cannot be restricted to one pillar
You have said , Mr Solana , that the overwhelming majority of Europeans are unambiguously against the war
We are pretending to believe that the non-@@ existence of something can be proved
We are pretending to believe that we are fighting terrorism , when there is every indication that we are going to make it infinitely worse
We are pretending to believe that Iraq is a threat to the world , when actually it is a country on its knees
We are pretending to believe that only that country has weapons of mass destruction , when the entire region is a powder keg
We are pretending to believe that the 150 000 men amassed on the borders of Iraq are only there to put pressure on Saddam Hussein
We are also pretending to believe that democracy can be built by force on a site littered with mines and bombs
Mr President , I am ashamed today
Mr President , Mr Solana , war is never something inevitable that one just has to resign oneself to
Man decides to go to war; and man can put a stop to war
War can never be the right way to destroy weapons of mass destruction or combat terrorism
We are on the verge of a war that would have devastating consequences for the people of Iraq , for the whole region and the whole world
In this situation , we cannot stay silent about the legal and moral problems surrounding a war
All politicians should analyse what a war with Iraq would lead to
Millions of people would be forced to flee - refugees that the neighbouring countries cannot take care of
The war could spread to Israel and Palestine , and opposition to the West could grow , resulting in more terrorist attacks
Very great humanitarian efforts would be needed for Iraq 's 23 million people
Is it worth the cost ?
The war with Iraq is not about Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship or breaches of UN resolutions
What it is really about is power over oil and power in the region
The United Nations Charter permits the use of force for the preservation of peace only as a last resort , when all other options have been exhausted
Only the Security Council can make decisions on this
Neither the United Nations Charter nor international law permits the use of force for preventive purposes , however
A preventive war is the law of the street , the justice of the powerful , which swee@@ ps aside the international law on which the world is founded
The EU must protest strongly against this
There is no justification for Saddam Hussein 's devastating politics
Mr President , I have a poster in front of me here which says no to war
I am saying no to unilateral war
War is a failure of politics
We are talking about giving time to the inspec@@ tor@@ s; we are not talking about allowing Saddam Hussein to maintain - assuming he has them - weapons of mass destruction
Finally , I know that time is up but I wish to make two short points
No link has been made in the inspectors ' report to international terrorism
No evidence has been found which establishes that Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction - the contrary in fact
We must give the inspectors more time
Mr President , war is a grave thing
Erasmus said that war is sweet to those who do not know it
I believe we must condemn those who employ hypocrisy , double standards , half truths and total distortions in order to take us to war
We must give peace another chance
We in the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities have repeatedly emphasised the need for conflicts to be resolved by peaceful means
War with Iraq will not only signal the resounding failure of diplomacy and policy , it will also mean that we have betra@@ yed our values and our culture
It will mean that old Europe has no new , alternative standard to raise against the philosophy and culture of violence being promoted by the USA
The rulers of Europe have a huge responsibility at this crucial stage
Does this attitude show loyalty to the European Union ?
Is this position which breaks European consensus loyal ?
Are these televised comments by Aznar in which he states that he will back Bush unconditionally in a unilateral attack loyal ?
Are they loyal , given that we know that that would violate international law and the United Nations Charter ?
The enormous majority of Spanish society is against a unilateral attack
Spain opposed the unilateral attack on Libya and on Panama at the time and now it fully supports the common European position
Representatives of the Council and the Commission , has Prime Minister Aznar informed you of his unconditional unilateral support for Bush ?
With regard to Mr Galeote 's recommendations , they would be cynical if they are not first applied to Aznar
Mr President , I would first of all like to thank the many honourable Members who have accompanied me during this sitting for their tenacity and perseverance
I would like to speak briefly , without exceeding the time allotted to me , to explain various issues
Firstly , there can be no doubt that this is a difficult debate
It is a debate which goes to the heart of the European Union 's foreign policy and beyond
We have a new world situation which may undoubtedly have consequences for the future which are hard to predict today
But I would like to say that we must not indulge in a sort of pessimism about the European Union 's inability to reach common positions
We are talking about such serious issues as war and peace
We are talking about something extremely gra@@ ve; life or death
And it is therefore natural that so many Members of Parliament have spoken in very different ways and that the governments have also at times said so many differing things
I say this within the context of the European Union
There was pressure , very significant pressure from many countries , the majority of countries of the European Union
And we should also recognise the courage of the British Prime Minister , Mr Tony Blair , at that time
Amongst all of us we managed to ensure that that operation , which appeared to be under way , was brought within the context of the United Nations
And for seven long weeks Resolution 14@@ 41 was debated
All of this action was unquestionably led by European countries in order to achieve a unanimously approved Resolution
our actions have been significant and they continue to be so
Resolution 14@@ 41 obliged the inspectors , Dr B@@ li@@ x and Mr El@@ Bar@@ ade@@ i , to produce a report
They were kind enough to speak with the President of the European Parliament yesterday by vide@@ o@@ conference
The Members of this Parliament are well informed about what Mr B@@ li@@ x thinks
You have an in-depth knowledge of what he thinks , not only from what he has said in public , but also from what he said in that vide@@ o@@ conference
This pessimism was not the result of ignorance , since he is a wise man , who has worked on the inspection of weapons of mass destruction for many years
He was somewhat pessimistic because he recognised that there had not been the cooperation he had hoped for
He had hoped , with his skill , his experience and generosity , for greater cooperation
But despite all of this , we must continue and we have therefore asked the countries of the European Union to give all possible assistance to the inspectors
what kind of assistance can we give ?
There will be other sittings and no doubt this Parliament will analyse within a few days the reports which will be produced in the United Nations Security Council
On the 14 February there will be a second report from the inspectors and we will see how the situation is developing
I would urge you to read the declaration which emerged from that meeting
That declaration is not so different from the European Union 's declaration on Monday , quite the contrary , although it is perhaps less forceful
We are therefore working in the right direction
Will we achieve a good outcome ?
We will see , but we have a political dynamic which nobody would have expected a few months ago
I have received six motions for resolutions
The European Parliament must speak out clearly against war as a means of dis@@ arming Iraq , because the vast majority of our citizens is against it
by forcing disarmament through inspections and demanding answers to the inspectors ' questions
All further action must take place within the framework of the UN
It is inconceivable that a superpower would be able to unilaterally solve the problem by military means
The fact that Iraq has been weakened by the Gulf War ten years ago and has oil wells does not justify making an exception to this
There are many other problems waiting to be resolved , such as the Palestine issue , the Middle East , Kashmir and so on
It is not only the Kurds in Iraq who are waiting for recognition of their rights as a people , but also those in Syria , Turkey and Iran
The pressure on Saddam must be maintained until the regime falls or conforms with the international rule of law
The road to a durable peace must be coupled with disarmament and development
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the withdrawal of North Korea from the Nuclear Non-@@ Pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation Treaty
Mr Y@@ iann@@ it@@ sis , the President-in-Office of the Council , has the floor to make his statement
The European Union is ready and waiting to offer its good services to support the negotiations currently under way
However , it is not prepared to allow anyone to challenge the international framework for the control and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons
I should like to start with the parameters and background to the problem , so that we all come at this from the same starting point
Especially at a time when , from what it said , the United States was willing to talk
The European Union has issued a series of statements expressing its deep concern about these developments
We support the Agency and the resolutions it has passed on this issue
Developing nuclear weapons is not an effective defence policy
We again call on North Korea from this tri@@ bune to reconsider its decision and honour all its obligations under its international commitments
Mr President , just three years ago we all hoped that the Korean peninsul@@ ar could look forward to a much better future
The summit meeting in Pyongyang in 2000 between President Kim Dae-@@ jun@@ g and North Korea 's Chairman Kim J@@ ong@@ -@@ il encouraged hopes of further constructive developments
Since then , however , progress has not been so evident
Political level contact between North Korea and South Korea continued , as did family re@@ unions and business contacts , but the promised second summit did not take place
H@@ opes of reconciliation are kept alive , but the pat@@ ro@@ l boat clash last summer shows how fragile those hopes are
All that has generated justified concern , but it is the deterioration in the relationship with the United States that has generated most worry
We all , I am sure , share anxiety about the developments over the past two months
North Korea is now the only country ever to have left the non-proliferation treaty
It expelled the IAEA inspectors and said it was restarting plutonium production at Y@@ ong@@ by@@ ong
Clearly , if North Korea begins to process significant quantities of plutonium for military use , the situation would deteriorate quickly and seriously
That reality is understood by all our partners and , of course , not least , the United States
This is not however just an issue between the DPRK and the United States
It is a regional issue which carries grave risks for both Korea and Japan
It is also a crisis with global impact in terms of the non-proliferation worries which it raises
Clearly , if the situation worsen@@ s , there are likely to be adverse economic effects on the global economy including the European Union
But it is also clear that the European Union is not a major participant in the affairs of that region
We are of course a significant partici@@ pan@@ t; we have provided nearly 300 million euros in different types of aid to the DPRK since the mid-@@ 1990s
The European Union has also consistently been involved as a humanitarian donor - a role that was symbolised most recently by the 9
The European Union , for this and other reasons , has some credibility vis-à-vis the DPRK
The timing , composition of the delegation and modalities are to be decided later and preparations for such a visit can now be undertaken
A clear condition , however , is that the delegation must be received by Chairman Kim J@@ ong@@ -@@ il
I can report that our South Korean friends have pressed strongly for an EU initiative and there has been general encouragement from other partners
P@@ la@@ in@@ ly , we also need to prevent a wedge from being driven between the efforts of the international community to counter the recent DPRK decisions
Further contact may therefore be needed with our closest allies and the United States in this case in particular
As the situation develops , the Commission will keep Parliament regularly informed
In the meantime , we hope for the continued and valued support of Parliament in our efforts to foster temper@@ ate and constructive attitudes on all sides
I would end by saying that the world is not in acute need of more conflicts
Mr President , I have been the co-@@ author of two resolutions in quick succession with J@@ as Gawronski and Jacques Santer , who are experts on this very isolated country
North Korea presents one of the most threatening humanitarian crises and military fl@@ ash@@ points on the globe
North Korea remains a failing , rogue state and a very dangerous one at that
It could wreak havoc on South Korea with which it is technically still at war , and it has ten thousand arti@@ ll@@ ery pieces aimed at Seoul
I am at a loss as to why out-@@ going President Kim of South Korea is so flat@@ tering about his Pyongyang counterpart
There are also suspicions that both countries are helping Iran 's covert weapons proliferation programme
The EU must assess the situation carefully and concentrate on delivering humanitarian aid
The DPRK cannot pursue a policy of ignoring the collective will of the United Nations and must cease its nuclear proliferation immediately
I do not have many real differences with our fellow Members from the PPE-DE on this issue
North Korea is withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-@@ Pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation Treaty , refusing inspections by the inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and re-@@ launching its nuclear programme
Are we going to threaten war ?
Thank goodness for that and I am glad to see such wisdom
I entirely agree with the motion for a resolution
I would like to highlight three points from it
The first point relates to Pakistan 's role in this issue
Secondly , I welcome the decision of the Council and the Commission to also view the North Korean problem from a humanitarian perspective
Finally , the point which is probably closest to our hearts , which is dialogue
I believe that it is really this firm dialogue which could lead to a solution to the issue
Mr President , only two weeks ago North Korea announced its withdrawal from the Non-@@ Pro@@ li@@ fer@@ ation Treaty , to which it had been a party for 17 years
This decision was made in a climate of international uncertainty , especially when weapons of mass destruction are concerned
The threat of proliferation of nuclear weapons is grave and we are currently balancing on the brink of war in Iraq because of weapons of mass destruction in rogue states
The North Korean withdrawal is not only a threat to regional stability
D@@ est@@ abil@@ ising the Korean peninsula would have more far-reaching consequences
N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ s in far-@@ off countries alike have an interest in making North Korea change its mind
Besides displaying a lack of respect for international security , the North Korean decision also shows complete disregard for the well-being of an already impoverished population
Human suffering in North Korea is immense
the right to live
In the past eight years , more than two million people have star@@ ved to death in North Korea
More will suffer the same fate if donors feel forced to restrict aid as a direct consequence of North Korean withdrawal from the N@@ P@@ T
A concerted effort by regional partners and international organisations is the best way forward
China , Japan and South Korea along with the United Nations , the EU and the United States should be active in seeking a solution
The recent resumption of talks between North and South Korea demonstrates that dialogue is possible
Some groups here have worked together to table a joint resolution expressing a reaction to the current situation in North Korea
Together we share the view that the North Korean position is untenable
Besides condemnation and calls for a change of course , we have underlined the need for dialogue and repeated our position on human rights
North Korea must change its decision for the sake of regional and international stability as well as its own people
Mr President , US President Bush branded North Korea as part of an axis of evil with Iraq and Iran
These unwise words evidently caused North Korea to believe they were on George Bush 's hit list
The proliferation of nuclear weapons in east Asia opens up an appalling vis@@ ta
This is potentially a much more serious conflict than that in Iraq
Already last October , the government of North Korea was reportedly running a secret uranium enrichment programme in blatant violation of the KEDO Agreement
It is now inconceivable that Commissioner Patten , as he himself has acknowledged , could come to the European Parliament and request money from the EU funds for nuclear transfers
Mr President , the whole world pays homage to the ' Sun of the 21st century ' , the successor to the ' Great Lead@@ er '
He only has to threaten and the heads of government come be@@ gging for concessions on ben@@ ded knees
This is the vague picture of his absolute rule that millions of North Koreans get
How do we find a sensible answer to the real threat from this tyrannical Sun King ?
The regional leaders appear not to have the power , the will or the opportunity they need to free themselves from the threat of North Korea
On the other hand , one cannot expect the Americans to solve this global problem alone
The Security Council is the organ designated to act in this case
Section 7 of the Charter states that the Council should adopt a resolution that contains clear steps towards de-@@ escalating this dangerous conflict
The first objective of the EU delegation to Pyongyang must therefore be to bring about discussions with the UN rather than the US
Clearly , there can be no possibility of military action to destroy nuclear plant in Korea
In his account of the facts with which we who are concerned with these issues are already quite familiar , the Commissioner mentioned a possible US attack
I feel that this is to be completely excluded , for it could lead to war , possibly even nuclear war , on the Korean peninsula
The United States , which favoured isolation at the start of the crisis , now appears to lean more towards dialogue
Every initiative which supports Saddam Hussein 's cause makes him more stubborn and less inclined to bow before our requests and pressure
Now , there are two mistakes we must avoid in negotiations with North Korea
There must , however , be two indispensable conditions in our negotiations with North Korea
Firstly , we cannot tolerate the existence of a nuclear weapons programme in that country
Secondly , any agreement must lay down exceedingly rigid , per@@ va@@ sive control measures to prevent North Korea from taking us for a ride once again
On this basis , the conference we propose in our joint motion for a resolution would be extremely useful as a European Union initiative
If these objectives are to be shared by North Korea , we strongly urge the parties to engage in constructive dialogue
It is also an important element in terms of the dismantling of the nuclear programme
These are all clear signs that the international community does not intend to isolate or marginalise North Korea
On the contrary , it is up to the North Koreans to understand the substance of our message
I have received six motions for resolutions
The next item is the Council and Commission statements on the 5@@ 9@@ th UNHCR meeting to take place in Geneva from 17 March 2003 to 25 April 2003
One of the aims of the Greek Presidency is to step up the human rights dialogue between the European Parliament and the Council
We need to integrate and mainstream human rights and fundamental freedoms into all EU policies and actions
The European Union has a long history and has managed to create an area of legal security and inviolable freedoms of which we are rightly proud
We hope that this will respond to our citizens ' expectations and increase their level of protection
As you know , abolishing the death penalty and torture , combating discrimination against women and protecting children from exploitation are our main lines of approach
Respect for these principles must inform all aspects of the Union 's foreign policy , even if there is an economic or political price to pay
This approach will guarantee our credibility
It was also the first time the United States was absent from the Commission and the Middle East dominated the discussions and overshadowed every other initiative
European motions on Iran , Chechnya and Zimbabwe were thrown out for the first time in the Commission 's history
I should point out that , apart from the return of the United States , the composition of the Commission is more or less the same as last year
I should also like to point out that the way in which the Human Rights Commission functions reflects the complicated and difficult power struggles with which we have to work
Ladies and gentlemen , with this general context in mind , I should like to say a few words about how the Council is currently preparing for this meeting
The CO@@ H@@ O@@ M working group organised its first two-@@ day meeting on preparations for the work of the Commission two weeks ago
Deleg@@ ates from the various geographic working groups were invited to this meeting for a presentation of this year 's priorities
With the help of senior officials , CO@@ H@@ O@@ M has already managed to identify which countries are willing to agree on an action package
It has also identified which countries need further discussion , rapprochement and information and has called for reports from the heads of the Community representations in these countries
I must stress that no final decisions - and hence no initiatives - have been taken
This debate has come along at exactly the right time , because the CO@@ H@@ O@@ M meeting on 5 February will be able to consider your ideas and comments
Ladies and gentlemen , I have deliberately not gone into all the European Union 's actions in this area for the current period
The Union 's traditional report on the human rights situation in various parts of the world will cover the countries which give cause for concern
A draft is already under way and we are endeavouring to give this report weight by covering about twenty or thirty countries
Here too , the views of the European Parliament on the countries which we need to support will be vital
As far as thematic decisions are concerned , the final decisions will again be taken in February
What I can tell you is that motions are already being prepared on the death penalty and children 's rights
It is a difficult path to tread , but it is the only path
She might well have turned in her grave at the recent events in Geneva
The election of a Li@@ by@@ an chair to the primary UN body dealing with human rights has rightly prompted wonder@@ ment at how this can be
The secret vote called at the be@@ h@@ est of the United States led to a common abstention by seven EU Member States in the Commission on Human Rights
The performance of the new chair will undoubtedly be closely scrutinised
It is now time for the EU to focus on the initiatives it will take in the 5@@ 9@@ th session
The challenges facing the EU constitute a decidedly uphill task
At the 5@@ 8th session last year we saw the Commission of Human Rights vote down EU initiatives on Zimbabwe , Chechnya and Iran
Those results prompted a b@@ out of soul-searching as to how the EU could improve the prospects for its country and thematic resolutions
These are important measures because they free up time for lobbying - diplomatic groundwork can , of course , make all the difference between failure and success
The EU has rightly defended the need for country resolutions alongside thematic resolutions
This constructive system is not embraced by the vast majority of the international community , with over 150 states declining to issue a standing invitation to the UN special mechanisms
It is undoubtedly a difficult process to determine which countries should be subject to EU action in the Commission on Human Rights
Discussions are set to continue at the CO@@ H@@ O@@ M meeting on 5 February 2003
Clearly , the EU 's approach to Iran and China at the Commission on Human Rights will attract a great deal of interest
The EU is engaged in human rights dialogues with both countries , with the primary aim of achieving concrete progress on the ground
That is why we have designed a set of clear benchmarks to measure results
That decision must be made on the basis of our assessment of the human rights situation on the ground
For the first round of dialogue with Iran , the initial assessment is cautiously positive
After a year 's absence , the United States returns as a member of the Commission on Human Rights
It is important for the EU and the United States to pursue their common interests in advancing human rights in the often hostile climate at the Commission on Human Rights
Those differences should neither be artificially pa@@ pered over nor allowed to block meaningful cooperation
The next round of consultations is scheduled for 6 February 2003
Ladies and gentlemen , I must warn you that we are running late and we will therefore have to administer the debate very strictly
Since I have no desire to use my repressive powers , I would ask you to administer yourselves in a disciplined fashion
We should not , though , be creating difficulties about the UNHCR 's standing in view of this year 's chairmanship having been entrusted to Libya , of all countries
I find it a particular cause of embarrassment that this was made possible by the European Union abstaining when it came to the vote
I have heard what the representative of the Council has said
He quoted the fine declarations that were made in June 2001
At the General Affairs Council this week , we learned how the absence of any agreement has meant that the opposite has been the result , in Zimbabwe for example
Obviously , considerations of human rights were seen as less important than issues of economics
A review of the last meeting is of little use to me right now; I would have been very keen to hear it once the meeting was over
Parliament and the public have a right to know what the Council and the Commission did at the UNHCR meeting , and why they did it
I am glad , though , when a dialogue on human rights is got underway with a country , and the Commissioner mentioned Iran as being one of them
As the rapporteur for Iran , that is something that I welcome
Iran should , though , demonstrate the seriousness with which it takes such a dialogue by cooperating with the United Nations
I found a number of positive things in what the Commissioner said , and I hope that we can make them a reality
In this resolution , we have listed a number of countries as illu@@ strations of the indisputable deficits in the area of human rights
We will therefore be rejecting the relevant amendments - not because of their content , but for procedural reasons
Mr President , first of all I would like to welcome the statements from the previous speaker on a deb@@ ri@@ ef@@ ing from the Council and the Commission following the UN hearing
I think that would be extremely welcome and I say that as a delegate who has attended the three previous sessions
We must recognise the fundamental importance of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and we call on the EU Presidency to address this important issue
The case of the Cairo 52 in Egypt is still unresolved after more than 18 months , and again more people have been arrested for alleged homosexuality
The complaints of the three British men , N@@ es@@ bit@@ t , N@@ awa@@ z and Pan@@ k@@ hur@@ st , who have made serious allegations of abuse , have yet to be investigated
I agree with the Council that we must be consistent in our applications and our approach , and must be determined to end human rights abuses wherever they occur
Mr President , do the viol@@ ators of human rights have much to fear and the victims much to expect from the UN Human Rights Commission ?
Some countries also manage to repeatedly avoid cen@@ su@@ re; this produces a distorted picture of the human rights situation in the world and tar@@ n@@ ishes the legitimacy of the Commission
Regrettably , having a notorious viol@@ ator of human rights such as Libya as the chairman of the Commission is an example of this
It is high time for reform that will prevent these kinds of undesirable developments
In order to exert maximum influence , coordination must take place with the United States on as many aspects as possible
I understand that that does in fact happen
S@@ election is inevitable , but that certainly does not mean that all countries that have not been named will get off sco@@ t-@@ free
The European Union must integrate the outcomes of Geneva into its policy and resume the political dialogue with the countries concerned
A meeting is only successful , however , if it is feared by the viol@@ ators and applauded by the victims
Mr President , I am a critical person , and I am very sad to have become afflicted in this period with pessimism regarding the future of our world too
The blame lies not just with those violating these rights but also with those who see what is happening but do not intervene and genuinely enforce international law
In this sense , governments are often indifferent towards the work of UNHCR and their recommendations go unheeded
Three hundred and fifty Palestinian children and 80 Israeli children have been killed in the last two years , innocent victims of our failure to act
Europe is founded on the principles of democracy and the rule of law
We need the provision of enough UNHCR financial and human resources to be able to act more effectively
Mr President , Geneva for us will be the moment of truth
We will not be able to do this if we lose our ability to act consistently
We will no longer appear credible and we , old Europe , will be left without that moral authority we need so much
We cannot then expect our citizens and NGOs to take us seriously
Nor did our debate in this House , and the resolution we adopted unanimously on 19 December 2002 , have any effect
On 26 January 2003 , the People 's Court in Ch@@ eng@@ du confirmed the death sentences that had been passed on Lob@@ san@@ g D@@ hon@@ du@@ p and on the Buddhist lam@@ a Ten@@ z@@ in D@@ ele@@ k
They were accused of involvement in an attack using explo@@ sives and of sabotaging national unity
L@@ eng@@ thy solitary confinement without contact with family or legal representatives is a manifest breach of the UN 's minimum standards for the treatment of prisoners
Their trial was neither fair nor in accordance with the rule of law
A public hearing in open court - demanded by this Parliament among others - was refused on the flimsy grounds that state secrets were involved
There was no free choice of legal representation , and public defence counsel were appointed by the court
Lob@@ san@@ g D@@ hon@@ du@@ p 's execution resulted in immediate protests by the EU Member States
It will also be on the agenda of the human rights conversations between Germany and China
For decades , this lam@@ a has worked in the religious , cultural and social fields - with such manifest success that all hard@@ liners see him as a threat
We call upon the European Union , first and foremost , to fight to ensure that there are no off-@@ limits zones in the protection of human rights
One such off-@@ limits zone could be the fight against terrorism , which should be based firmly on respect for international humanitarian law
First , we should not be mil@@ d-@@ man@@ ne@@ red psycho@@ therap@@ ists in one country and unrelenting public prosecutors in another
The criteria applied to Turkey should also apply to Iran and the criteria applied to Iran should also apply to Turkey
And while we are on the subject of Turkey , it is about time that Leyla Zana , the woman awarded the Sakharov prize , saw the light of day
And it would be an important achievement if that were to happen under the Greek Presidency
Thirdly , we must look at new rights being violated by measures against terrorism
We must give all of our support to the proper functioning of this Commission so that it can fully play its role
We must strongly support the UN 's initiative to have a permanent forum on these issues in order to raise awareness and promote the cause of indigenous peoples
We must also do everything we can to ensure the maintenance of the working group , which is the only one of its kind dealing with indigenous peoples ' issues
Our inconsistency is a form of political prostitution and undermines our moral authority in this field
I welcome this joint resolution and , as mentioned in paragraph 16 , the EU Presidency should support further resolutions on a number of countries
Pro@@ -@@ democracy campaigners and political activists are often detained without charge and , in some cases , charged with inciting sub@@ version
It is essential that the Presidency make human rights a core part of all dialogue with China
In the Middle East , I condemn the way in which human rights are abused because of the use of terrorism , especially suicide bombings carried out by Palestinian extremists
But I also condemn the state terrorism inflicted on the ordinary people of Palestine by Israel
With regard to Iran , EU leaders had expressed the hope that engaging Iran in political dialogue would strengthen reformist elements and improve human rights
Sadly , stoning seems to have been only stopped temporarily , for reasons of image
Numerous newspapers are being closed down daily and unfortunately the number of executions has increased significantly
The protection and promotion of human rights is one of the fundamental principles of the EU
Mr President , I should like to thank the speakers for their comments and observations
We are not sparing any effort to persuade everyone we can of the need to implement human rights
Of course , what is important in the final analysis is for the pressure we exert to bring about results and not just remain political pressure
I personally believe that the decision to abstain was not an expression of indifference
That would not be in the nature of the European Union
It was a considered decision which , it was hoped , would help the Commission on Human Rights operate smoothly under the political circumstances which arose last year
I should also like to point out that of course we are interested in abolishing the death penalty , it is one of Europe 's crowning achievements
We take a keen interest in the question of the death penalty everywhere
Mr President , I have noted that the issue of the death penalty has been raised by almost every speaker
I agree that this needs to be pushed and is an issue which is , in fact , the same in every system , in every country
As such , this issue deserves strong attention and more activity
It would be extremely good if this really were the case
The world is more evil than that
There is extremism and it is not possible to avoid the problem totally by having our own record straight or even having global decency really move forward
This involves a number of fundamental problems , but having said this , I agree with the approach expressed in this formulation
Certainly , we have to be extremely careful not to damage these ideals by fighting terrorism
It is extremely important to maintain that balance
I would like to mention for the record that this is not what appears from the figures in that vote
I have received six motions for resolutions
First of all , I wish to apologise , on behalf of Parliament , that the debates have been somewhat protracted
We shall take account of the views that have been put forward and shall of course endeavour to avoid this kind of situation arising in future
The next item is a continuation of the debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on illegal exploitation of the wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo
In all events , even if Parliament cannot find a way and cannot abide by a few rules , we shall abide by them , as befits our position
The European Union has refrained from passing a resolution on this recent report by the committee of experts until the Security Council does so
As far as one particularly controversial product is concerned - so-called blood diamonds - both the international community and the European Union have taken specific action
The European Union also adopted Council resolution 23@@ 6@@ 8/2002 on the application of the K@@ im@@ ber@@ ley certification process on 20 December , which is when it became operational
I should like to finish by pointing out that there is a basic vicious circle here that needs to be broken
The Commission organised a meeting in K@@ ins@@ has@@ a between the experts and the heads of Commission delegations in countries covered by the investigation
The Commission stands ready to continue this constructive cooperation in the future , if required to do so
The Commission has taken careful note of the report of the panel of experts , which was the subject of a resolution in the UN Security Council last week
Saying that it is restored is a euphemis@@ tic reference to the historic reality of that country , but with rule of law and viable administration things can be different
This needs to happen not only in the zones controlled by armed rebel groups , but also over the entire Congolese territory
Together with other donors , the Commission is prepared to support the Democratic Republic of Congo in the transition process and in its efforts to establish an efficient public administration
Recently , the Commission adopted a decision for the grant of EUR 16 million to support capacity building in the Democratic Republic of Congo
This is not a new problem we are discussing
Ex@@ tr@@ action of mineral wealth in the Democratic Republic of Congo is not a story of transparency and good governance
This was the case long before , during , and after the Mo@@ but@@ u regime
This became the subject of the aforementioned investigations
The United Nations Security Council is the appropriate forum to ensure such concerted action
The Commission welcomes the initiative by the United Nations to organise an international conference on peace , democracy , security and development in the Great Lakes Region
It is very important that we guarantee ownership rights and a steady progress towards transparency in these matters , even without UN Security Council resolutions which have a limited reach
Madam President , I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for that very in@@ sigh@@ tful analysis of what has been going on
This resolution is an important step forward in favour of international law and the rule of law
Sub@@ -@@ Saharan Africa has seen millions of people massac@@ red , genocide committed , whole tribes ethnically cleans@@ ed in the last 20 years
O@@ sten@@ sibly , these conflicts have been based , as in Angola or Rwanda , on so-called historic divisions
But the reality is that an underlying factor in most of these cases has been commercial gain , based on supposed tribal protection
Africa is supposed to be one of the richest continents in the world , inhabited by the poorest people in the world
This is so because the rule of law and international law has not operated in Africa for a long time
The Democratic Republic of Congo has been exploited , loo@@ ted and robbed
So I welcome this resolution and I commend it
Madam President , Parliament has long been concerned about the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Great Lakes Region in Africa in general
Fortunately , armed conflict in the region has ended
It is now time to launch the process of reconstruction
The future of the Democratic Republic of Congo and peace in that country depend on establishing democracy and sustainable development
As regards establishing democracy , we trust the Pre@@ tor@@ ia Agreement will prove an effective measure and will be implemented in sensible stages
The Pre@@ tor@@ ia Agreement is truly an all-encompassing and inclusive agreement
An all-embracing system of democracy can only be established if all associations and political groupings are included in the process
This is especially important in the Great Lakes Region where a breakdown in social order was the root cause of the wars that laid waste to the region
A number of major problems are still outstanding , however
They must be resolved to assure the future of the region
Such problems can only be tackled through sound political institutions , once implementation of the agreement is under way
The major problem I have in mind is that of a system of justice
Im@@ p@@ unity is incompatible with democracy and there can be no peace without a system of justice
In this connection , I would like to table an amendment to in@@ dent 4 tomorrow
I would like to replace the phrase referring to other places , when these acts have been committed with one referring to other places , including the acts committed
The other element crucial to the future of the Democratic Republic of Congo is sustainable development
The countries and the companies of the European Union have a key role to play in this process
Companies can play their part by adopting an ethical code of conduct demonstrating commitment to sustainable development
Countries can be involved by establishing measures to limit the importation of goods of dubious origin
The Group of the Party of European Socialists will relentlessly pursue its campaign demanding transparency and ethical standards from multinational companies in the developing world
The United Nations report adopts a clear stance on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo
We hope Member States , the Commission and Parliament will all insist on implementation of the report 's recommendations
Madam President , my group has not added its signatures to the joint resolution
Of course we too agree that the illegal exploitation of the natural resources in Congo must be strongly condemned
Of course we too agree that people and companies who enrich themselves from war must be stopped and punished
We therefore welcome the fair analysis , the first in the hundred years since the plundering of Congo began
It is , therefore , quite simply a shame that the report is so sloppy and that it contains so many unfounded accusations and inaccuracies
This list of shame could have been an historic precedent , a warning to all leaders and business people who un@@ scrupulously exploit the misery of millions for personal gain
Instead it has become a weak , contentious document based on rumours and war propaganda
This is why the report was weighed and found wanting by the Security Council this week
The mandate of the experts was extended by six months
The Security Council is absolutely right to urge that all the named countries institute their own investigation on the basis of which legal action can be taken
We have submitted an amendment to this effect
The United Nations bears a colossal responsibility for this
Unfortunately , under the dictatorship of President Mo@@ but@@ u , the country has fallen into economic and political crisis
We should be aware that the GNP per inhabitant has decreased to one sixth of what it was twenty years ago
That is the important thing about the United Nations report
I think that we have a real responsibility in this respect
The Council and the Commission should also equip themselves with a restrictive legal framework and demand , in particular , greater transparency in the way that markets are allocated
Madam President , the situation in the Congo is tragic
Millions of citizens are living in appalling conditions
The top political leaders , regional and foreign companies and the armed forces have established what appears to be a real war economy
The list of people involved in this damaging trafficking should be the spearhead for us to launch genuine and forceful action
The responsibility of companies is now closely linked to that of our governments
We can no longer turn a blind eye to what is nothing more and nothing less than neo-colonial plundering in disguise
It is clear that establishing the rule of law and democratic institutions will be essential
But prior coordinated action among Member States aimed at putting an end to their own companies ' activities has become essential
Numerous private undertakings have also joined in helping themselves to the country 's raw materials
Although firms from outside Europe are also involved , we should very definitely be working through and analysing the list naming European firms and private individuals
This should be done in the individual Member States and with a view to criminal prosecution
We cannot fail to observe that certain governments col@@ lude and collaborate with European firms that then provide certain regimes with a lifeline in order to maximise their own profits
If we do not speak frankly about these things , we will bring about no real change in the situations in Africa
Madam President , I come from what was once a colon@@ ising country , Belgium , whose emotional ties with the Democratic Republic of Congo have never been cut
The Congo has exceptional natural resources
In 1997 , the value of the resources in the North was estimated at USD 25 billion
It is probably the country with the greatest resources in the world
It is a veritable holocaust
People are quoting figures of 4
It will conduct the necessary enquiries and will ensure that there are repercussions
It will not add complicity in the present to the burden of past colonisation
The right to defence must be preserved
Madam President , as a Belgian , this resolution appeals to me particularly because Congo used to be a Belgian colony
Other countries too in old and new Europe are , however , guilty of plundering the natural resources of Africa
It is now no longer the old mother countries but , deser@@ vedly or und@@ es@@ er@@ vedly , European companies who are named in the UN report
Europe must in any event take measures , because we have a collective historic responsibility
I have just returned from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre , Brazil
I also listened to the Africans there
They are expecting a lot from Europe - for example , reparations of a kind
A committee of enquiry has been set up in the Belgian Senate which will look into the illegal trade in raw materials in the region of the Great Lakes
On the other hand , a control mechanism for the exploitation of raw materials in Congo must be set up
The United Nations has a more urgent assignment here than in Iraq
It is ridiculous even to think the Zimbabwean government could be asked to investigate its own activities
The political , economic and humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe is worsening with serious implications for the security situation
Two days ago , the United States government issued a travel warning urging United States citizens to consider departure from Zimbabwe
Is it not deeply offensive that one European Union government has invited Mugabe to a summit conference in Paris ?
One reason why our measures have been ineffective so far is that they have not been rigorously enforced and their scope is too narrow
This is not the time to be reducing pressure on the Mugabe regim@@ e; instead , international action must be intensified
The European Union must be determined and consistent in its tough policy in relation to the Mugabe regime and see this matter through , for the benefit of all Zimbabweans
If the Congo did not possess such an incredible wealth of natural resources , Africa would have far less in the way of problems
The United Nations report has spelled out , albeit with perhaps insufficient clarity , the shameful forms of greed that give rise to the illegal exploitation of this wealth
The global community must find ways and means of putting a stop to this exploitation
Illegal actions must be punished , and commercial undertakings must be made to comply with a code of conduct
Madam President , Mr Rod asked if we found his choice of words a little too direct
I certainly do not think the terminology was incorrect
We need to work on a much broader basis on the issue of transparency and the principles of licensing
I just came back from Angola and the discussion about creating more transparency on oil revenue for the government is an extremely important matter
Even if there are not conflicts as such , progress in this area is important also for economic reasons
In the event of conflict , it becomes totally brutal and perverse
Mr Gahler related what we discussed here to the broader issue of Africa , mentioning also the coming summit in Lisbon
We can use those types of meetings to push these issues
Of course , this will be more effective if we have a clear and clean conscience ourselves
This is not just an issue in the form of a narrow debate
I definitely regard the link to using the OECD principles relating to this as a way of advancing transparency in relation to the issue
For the Commission , this is of the utmost importance
It is not enough to look at the public budget in a narrow sense when we talk about governance in our partner countries
I would mention , by way of example , the good effort which is now being tried out in the funding of the oil pipeline in Chad
This is just to illustrate that there are many things that it is possible to do in this
But definitely the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo is the worse of them all
In connection with this debate , I have received five motions for resolutions , submitted in accordance with Rule 37
Madam President , we granted a discharge to the Commission in April 2002 but we raised quite a number of questions in our motion for a resolution
The Commission has responded with a hundred comments and answers and explanations in a 60 page document
We now report in the follow-up , in our comment on the Commission 's response
We underline once again that the Commission under the Treaties has an obligation to make available to Parliament all the necessary information
In its work , Parliament relies heavily on the Court of Auditors ' annual report and its special report
This forms an important basis for the issues that we raise and investigate
In the on-going reform process , the Commission is moving in the direction of a system of control and accountability
This has , I believe , been said by the President of the Court of Auditors in this House
The Commission is moving towards a system of accountability which will compare with the highest standards of the Member States
A satisfactory outcome can only be achieved with the full cooperation and efficient administration of the individual governments of all Member States
Again , we have commented on the recurrence of the same problem in the 2001 budget
This of course is a failure in the budgetary procedure but various comments have been made by different people and we have asked for a simplification of the regulations
I believe , however , that what is necessary is a simplification of regional policy and the bringing about of economic and social cohesion
We also took note of the failure of the Commission to collect from the national governments money unduly paid and we note an outstanding amount of EUR 2
The question has also been raised in our follow-up about the appointment of a European Public Prosecutor
The national governments do not pursue the obligations to investigate fra@@ u@@ ds and abuses in relation to European money with the same efficiency that they apply to their own national budgets
Mr McCartin has just mentioned that it ran to sixty pages , a fact that I had forgotten
In general , the draft resolution encourages the Commission to press on with the efforts it has made to date
At this point , I would like particularly to express my gratitude to the rapporteur for his good cooperation with the Commission
Let me now briefly set out again the main steps that the Commission has taken with a view to improving financial management
I would like to start by discussing the implementation of reforms
In 2002 , the Directors-General , for the first time , submitted annual activity reports , which also specifically included financial management
The new Financial Regulation reinforces the Budget principles , something constantly urged by the Court of Auditors and , I believe , something essential in a Financial Regulation
These are just some of the essential points
Another aspect of crucial importance to financial management is the Commission 's restructuring of its external service
A second complex issue that I would like to deal with is that of the Budget surpluses , which Mr McCartin has also mentioned
An additional factor was that the payment forecasts submitted to the Commission by the Member States are often - if I may put it diplomatically - very optimistic
Let me , furthermore , follow Mr McCartin in making brief reference to the simplification of the rules of the Structural Funds
Recently - just before Christmas - the Commission also adopted a communication on improving the recovery of financial incentives provided in error from the European Budget
I would like to underline the importance of the establishment of the internal audit service , which will monitor the control systems as well
Tomorrow , my fellow-@@ Commissioner Neil Kinnock will be putting before the Commission his latest report on the state of play as regards reform
This report had been called for by Parliament , and I think that it , too , will be a sound basis for discussion in the current discharge procedure
Under expenditure is one of the most important
There was a budget surplus of 14 % in 2000
The figure for 2001 was 16 %
This situation should be prevented by improving the assessment of budgetary needs and the evaluation of running policies in order to optimise value for money for the European taxpayer
The problem of under expenditure is most worrying in the case of Structural Funds , in view of their objectives and of the important needs they address
Most recipients find the Regulations too complicated
In my view , applying the Regulations in a more flexible way could prove a solution to this difficulty
After all , the Structural Funds have a direct impact on citizens
Commissioner Barnier has already made several statements along these lines
As the rapporteur has requested , we should receive regular reports on progress in this area
It is essential to improve management of the recovery of unduly paid funds in order to improve budgetary control
The fight against fraud must be strengthened too
We will support the amendment tabled by Mr Blak aimed at improving access to documents
This would facilitate the work of the House
Madam President , Commissioner , the aim of this report is to assess the Commission 's implementation of the European Parliament 's recommendations
This is a useful exercise that will add effectiveness and credibility to our work and on which I congratulate the Commission and also our rapporteur
The high risk and even the practical impossibility of effectively monitoring the operation of the export refunds system was our overriding concern at the time
The same scenario or worse can be seen , incidentally , in the wine , dairy and most livestock product sectors
Madam President , Mr McCartin has drawn up an excellent report on matters that Parliament focused its attention on when it granted discharge for 2000
I wish to express my sincerest thanks for that
The way the EU budget is implemented is still unsatisfactory
The situation only got worse from 2000 to 2001 and the trend continued into 2002
5 billion in Structural Funds appropriations remained unspent , in 2001 the figure was 10
5 billion , and last year it was 8
The amount in unpaid commitments in respect of the Structural Funds has grown to EUR 66
7 billion , which is the equivalent of the budget for two years
The situation is very alarming
indeed , the situation is entirely beyond remedy
The EU 's structural policy has to be thoroughly re@@ vie@@ we@@ d; this programming period threatens to be a real catastrophe
The review of staff regulations that began in 2000 and is still going on is one of the most important of the reforms
It must be the obligation of every official to apply the whistle blowing procedure where necessary
On the other hand , everyone must also be accountable for his or her actions in the sense that people must face the consequences of making groundless personal accusations
The European Union must not become a place of espionage
There must be a more natural and swifter way to cla@@ w back EU funds paid out for no good reason
The present system is unwieldy and arbitrary , as is shown in the report by Jan Mulder , which we are to discuss next
Unfortunately , the Member States and the Commission are often on opposite sides of the negotiating table , even though they should really be on the same side
Madam President , Commissioner , this report sends out an ambiguous signal
The rapporteur is giving the European Commission a p@@ at on the head instead of the urgent stimulus that is needed to drastically improve management of the EU budget
I was not happy to see that the Commission is stating that most of the irregularities and fraud involving EU money take place in the Member States themselves
That may be so , but the Commission has the duty to manage the EU funds and is ultimately responsible for them
We must be able to approach the Commission on these issues
Compare this with the board of directors of a multinational denying responsibility for the efficiency of business activities that take place away from their head office
I have yet to encounter a shareholder who would accept that
It is obvious that the way the budget is managed by the Commission leaves much to be desired
Madam President , I will try to express my views succinc@@ tly and concentrate on two points
The first relates to the amendment tabled by Mr Blak and the second to an overview of the report we are currently debating
Concerning my first point , I fully support Mr Blak 's amendment
In my view it is in line with the spirit of the EC Treaty
I therefore support this amendment
I trust the good offices of the legal services and the relevant committee will re-establish the validity of Article 276 of the Treaty
In my opinion the report before us is excellent
I have already had the opportunity of assessing the document within the Committee on Budgetary Control
I should point out , as the Commissioner has already , that 2000 was a transitional year
Major reforms were drawn up during that year
These reforms are gradually being implemented and we will be able to assess their impact in the years to come
Of the three sections of the report , I would like to draw your attention to that concerning management
I wish to highlight the issue of under expenditure , in particular as this concerns the Structural Funds
I welcome Commissioner Barnier 's initiative to simplify the Regulations in this regard
The current Regulations are one of the causes of under expenditure
The latter is detrimental to citizens ' rights and to the image of the Commission itself
Further , regarding the issue of the recovery of unduly paid funds , I would like to highlight that these are Community funds
The same principle applies to the procedure in which it is clear that Parliament wishes to be involved in the financial management process
Parliament therefore requires all necessary information
As for the fight against fraud , I especially welcome the reference to the European Prosecutor
Madam President , Commissioner , may I quote something ?
I regard this as thoroughly good news for the Member States
We know , Commissioner , that this was not an exceptional occurrence
So there is something intrinsically wrong with the system
It is not good news for anybody if we are not in a position to establish the reality of Europe 's Budget
That is not good budgeting
It is not you alone that I blame , Commissioner
In future , we will have to adjust the amounts and figures actually spent against what was originally planned , or the other way around
In the long term , that is just not on
In the long term , our citizens will not stand for it
That is the crucial point about this discharge procedure for the year 2000
As I have said , things got worse rather than better in 2001
This is something on which we have to work together
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a
Firstly , it takes up almost half the budget - that is a widely known fact
Secondly we can state fairly generally that this policy is not held in particularly high esteem in Europe
I think that something needs to be done about this
Perhaps the proposals Mr Fischler made last week can improve things
I think that we must also ensure that the agricultural accounts are above suspicion
Now , agriculture is part of the European budget for which there is a special procedure for auditing the accounts - the clearance of accounts , as it is known
Every year , between EUR 600 million and EUR 800 million is claimed back from this budget of approximately EUR 45 billion
The big question is whether this is enough
That is being left to the Member States
What experience have we had since 1996 ?
There is clearly room for improvement
We would like the decisions on discharge to be more clearly based on one specific financial year
At the moment these decisions still relate to different financial years , and that is ambiguous
In 1996 we also expected that everything would take place a lot more quickly , but that has clearly not been the case
The Commission might say that this does not tally with the system of proportionality and that the penalty is much too great
The control of agricultural subsidies is particularly important in view of the enlargement of the European Union
The system that will soon be used for making payments is the IACS system
We can see from the reports from the Court of Auditors that this system is not yet operational in any of the current Member States
We hope , as does the Commission , that it will be operational in a few months ' time
We also note that Greece still does not meet the conditions despite having been a member for so many years
We are familiar with the DAS methodology and could envisage getting indicators about the size of the percentage error in the dairy sector or the tobacco sector , for example
This is something that Parliament has been wanting for some time
We would then be able to check from one year to the next how much improvement there has been
This evening the Council is conspicuous by its absence , which is highly regrettable given the importance of this subject
Let me briefly state my views on a number of the questions raised by this report , and explain the position taken by the Commission
I would like to start by briefly considering the evaluation of the 1996 reform
Both the report and the Court of Auditors back up the Commission 's view that the 1996 reform was a success
Despite that , I believe that success shows that we have done the right thing
In the last ten years alone , the Community has rec@@ la@@ im@@ ed nearly EUR 6 billion in agricultural aid from the Member States , who have , indeed paid up
These figures are eloquent and require no further eluci@@ dation
The Commission is fully in the picture as regards the delays in Greece , and its services are closely monitoring and evaluating the progress that is being made
Let me , though , make one thing clear
There is no reason to suppose that the financial risk to the Community is in excess of the financial adjustments already made by the Commission
The situation as regards 2002 is currently the subject of intensive examination
I will now turn briefly to the considerations linked to enlargement
The Commission 's services are currently occupied in determining the details of what these new Member States will need if they opt for the simplified IACS
There will of course be a strict timetable stipulating when the complete IACS must be available for transfer to the normal system
I therefore wish to ask you , honourable Members , to continue to cooperate with the Commission in making this system as good as it can be
Madam President , I would like to thank Mr Mulder for his report and all the work he has done on it
We must acknowledge that he is a person who understands the common agricultural policy in all its extremely complicated detail
Also , his comments here this evening were thoughtful and informative
We have come a long way , as Mr Mulder knows , from the days when 80 % of the budget of the European Union was spent on agriculture
Most of that money was spent on market support in the form of export refunds and storage , which mainly created opportunities for immense schemes of fraud and deception
Mr Mulder makes the point in his report that the people who commit offences should have to pay for them
Again , this was unfair to the taxpayers and constituted bad administration
Madam President , I wish to begin by congratulating Mr Mulder on his excellent report and on the work he has carried out on the clearance of accounts
I must also extend these congratulations to Mr McCartin
This is frequently due to the enormous complexity of these systems and the disproportionate bureaucratic burden that they impose both on the administrations and on the farmers themselves
Thirdly , the forms , processes and criteria with which this clearance of accounts is undertaken do not always appear to be as balanced as they could be
This is a situation that we find totally unacceptable and we hope that the Commission will remedy it as soon as possible
Madam President , Commissioner , we have before us Mr Mulder 's report on the reform of the procedure for the clearance of accounts
This reform seeks to prevent the long delays in clearance decisions , which have been criticised frequently by the Court of Auditors
The reform consists of two separate procedures
The first is an annual audit on the revenue and the expenditure of a single financial year
The second is a series of multiannual compliance audits intended to verify the substance of transactions and compliance with Community legislation
In addition , a conciliation procedure was introduced
Despite the difficulties entailed by this procedure , it has been shown to increase the responsibility of Member States , although it has not been as effective as was anticipated
The Conciliation Body has not been sufficiently effective either
It has however contributed to the overall improvement in the clearance of accounts
This report highlights how the procedure for clearance of EAGGF accounts requires further improvement
It puts forward a series of suggestions to this end
My group will therefore fully support the report
Finally , I would like to congratulate Mr Mulder on his report
The reform we are now studying must be developed , to enable information facilitating multiannual comparisons to be made available to the monitoring bodies in good time
This responsibility falls to the Commission , something that the rapporteur , Mr Jan Mulder , does well to point out , setting this in appropriate terms
We must also remember that the policy 's primary focus must always be the allocation of financial resources , especially when dealing with less highly-@@ developed countries
Madam President , the report we have before us is certainly excellent
As I already said within the Committee on Budgetary Control , I can but support it
C@@ ra@@ fted with meticulous attention to detail , it consists of two clearly differentiated parts and has two distinct aims
Firstly , there is a critical and rigorous assessment of the reform
Con@@ structive criticism is applied to the deficiencies of the latter
These include the division of the clearance procedure , the structure and activities of the Conciliation Body and the financial corrections applied
The shortcomings are detailed in a constructive manner however , and solutions are proposed
Secondly , the rapporteur expresses rational and legitimate concern about the immediate impact of enlargement , which is nearly upon us
This concern relates especially to the consolidation of the Integrated Administration and Control System in all Member States
Everything should also be in place for this system to be implemented in the candidate countries as soon as enlargement takes place
The lessons learnt about the SAPARD programme are also cause for concern
In my view , the critical assessment and concern detailed in this report constitute a timely warning
I therefore welcome the report wholeheartedly
I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on the flexibility he displayed during the proceedings in the Committee on Budgetary Control
His approach ensured that the report was adopted uno@@ p@@ posed
This represents a considerable achievement
Madam President , Commissioner , there are two issues arising from Mr Mulder 's superb report that I would like to briefly address
The first is that of recovery
Here we see the sum of some EUR 3 billion mounting up , and the amount of money outstanding keeps increasing
The recovery rate for 2000-2001 has been halved , down to some EUR 40 million
I believe I am right in saying that our recovery rate has not even reached 16 %
My second point , Commissioner , has to do with the implementation of IACS in Greece and , in future , in the candidate countries
This is a highly political question and not just one of whether or not maladministration has been brought to light there
At some point they will say to you , ' Come back in ten years , Mr Fischler
We will have introduced it by the time the Greeks do
And that , of course , as far as budgetary ex@@ acti@@ tu@@ de is concerned , is where we end up on very treach@@ erous ice
this is a highly political question , and one that cannot be reduced simply to maladministration
Commissioner , it is one that we have to get to grips with together
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a
Madam President , the proposal now before us is the second of three directives that aim to bring legislation in the Member States in line with the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention
We thus set out to achieve conciliation with considerably fewer problems than there were with regard to the first pillar
On the other hand , just these few issues caused huge problems , owing to differences in approach
The Commission proposal and the Council 's common position are rooted in the ' quick fix ' principle , while Parliament had hoped for a broader , horizontal approach
During conciliation we were able to find a two-stage solution to the problem
On the one hand , the requirements concerning public participation in line with the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention are to be included in new Community legislation from the outset
During conciliation the Member States undertook to promote practical opportunities for public participation
The time limits for participation in decision-making at the various stages must be reasonable , so that the public can prepare and participate in decision-making effectively
The matter of public participation in the updating of permits was of particular significance
The parties involved in the conciliation process wanted to find the right balance in this matter
On the other hand , an authority could check permits without any public participation when implementing acts and regulations where it is genuinely not a matter of discretion
After decisions are taken following public participation the public must naturally be able to evaluate them
In conciliation we arrived at a solution that is satisfactory as far as Parliament is concerned
We can therefore be confident that the ratification process of the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention on the whole will make headway in the Community without undue delay
I heartily recommend that Parliament endorse the results of the conciliation procedure in tomorrow 's vote
It supplements the Directive on environmental information
With it , the EU is taking a step closer to the implementation of the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention
The principles of the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention are very important , because the environment does not have its own vote , so to speak
Decision-@@ making on environmental matters must , therefore , be open and transparent if we are to afford the environment sufficient protection
This directive establishes a necessary common framework that also covers matters with a cross-border dimension
The details are left in the hands of the Member States , however
These activities are covered by the Directive on environmental impact assessment and the Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control
These two directives are now being supplemented with provisions on public participation and access to justice in accordance with the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention
By ' public participation ' the directive means that the public must be informed about the activities in question and its own right to participate
The section of the public affected is to have the right to comment on a matter at an early stage
Lastly , public bodies are to take due account of the outcome of public participation when making decisions and make their decisions known
The directive also contains provisions on reviewing the legality of decisions that fall within the scope of the provisions
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , one of the complaints most frequently made by the citizens concerns their limited role in representative democracy
It is precisely in the area of the environment that people 's dissatisfaction has been most deeply felt
This indignation increases exponentially when many of these projects with unacceptable environmental impacts are funded under the common agricultural policy and the Structural Funds
It was therefore very important that , in the wake of the Aarhus Convention , the Commission has legislated on public participation and public access to information
I therefore congratulate the Commissioner for the Environment
Greater public participation will not only give greater legitimacy to the decisions taken by our institutions but also enhance the quality of these decisions
I also congratulate our rapporteur on the work she has done in Parliament and also in the Conciliation Committee
I should like to highlight three main results of this Conciliation
Lastly , I welcome the announcement made by the Commissioner that we will have legislation on citizens ' access to justice before the end of 2003
Madam President , Commissioner , the results of conciliation overall are good and worthy of our support
The aim of the directive is to harmonise Community legislation with the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention
It will also allow the decision-makers to take the views and concerns of the public into account when making decisions
This will obviously and quite properly increase the transparency of the decision-making process and help to increase public interest in , and knowledge about , environmental issues
The requirements concerning public participation in line with the Å@@ r@@ hus Convention are to be included in future in relevant Community legislation from the outset
It is also important that authorities should also inform the public about the reasons for their decisions to a much greater extent
On this basis I believe we can expect the public 's inclination to have an influence on environmental issues to grow
We are now faced with something more , something different , and that is positive
Indeed , what is happening through this process ?
I must point out , in conclusion , that it will not , however , be at all easy to harmonise the different national laws with European requirements and directives
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a
Madam President , I will now present here the final appraisal of the directive on fuel quality , which we originally adopted in this House in 1998
We quar@@ rel@@ led particularly with the oil industry about whether there was a need to lower sulphur levels in petrol and diesel fuel
This turned out to be a very strategic and wise move
Low@@ ering the sulphur content of fuels will perhaps have proved even more important when we try to reduce air pollution
This will be very important in that we will really be able to puri@@ fy car exhaust emissions to a greater extent than before
These new engines , like direct injection engines , for example , will inevitably need these sulphur-free fuels
We should be satisfied with the end result
We succeeded in getting the Commission and the Council to agree that sulphur-free fuels would be on the market by 2009 , bringing forward the time frame by two years
I might perhaps say that Sweden and Finland were the countries where this was realised earlier on and clean fuels were brought onto the market very swiftly
In 2005 this directive will be reviewed
It is to be decided then whether there can in fact be sulphur-free diesel fuel by 2009
As rapporteur , I am only sorry that with this general solution we have not decided now that sulphur-free diesel fuels will be on the market in 2009
I think this interim evaluation in 2005 only complicates matters , but we did not succeed in getting this through in Parliament at second reading
The suspicion has arisen that the production of sulphur-free diesel fuel would mean increasing levels of carbon dioxide emissions
The re-evaluation in 2005 will also involve discussion on how sulphur-free or low-sulphur fuels for mobile machinery can be brought onto the market
This was perhaps the most problematic issue of all in the conciliation discussions
I myself would say I am fairly satisfied with the end result , which is that sulphur-free fuels will be introduced for tractors and other mobile machinery by 2009
I do not believe that farmers will have to pay a very great deal more for this as costs in general will ultimately fall
Madam President , I wish to correct one thing in the documentation
It says that Parliament adopted one amendment at first reading
I would like it recorded in the Minutes that Parliament adopted 36 amendments at first reading
Directive 98/@@ 70/@@ EC will enable us to ensure that the sale of lead@@ ed petrol is phased out
Sul@@ ph@@ ur in fuel can impair the effectiveness of several existing and emerging technologies , such as three-way catalytic converters , ox@@ idation cataly@@ sts , NOx St@@ or@@ age T@@ rap@@ s and particul@@ ate traps
That is why it is so important to phase in zero-@@ sulphur fuels
The phasing-in of zero-@@ sulphur fuels will be complete by 1 January 2009
The adoption of this directive is really good news for health and the environment in Europe
I would therefore thank the rapporteur , Mrs Hautala , and all the Members who have contributed to the adoption of this act
Madam President , work on the amendment of this Directive began over a year ago
We have finally reached an agreement and I would like to congratulate Mrs Hautala on such a satisfactory outcome
We encountered a number of difficulties during the first reading , but I believe we have now reached compromises acceptable to all
As we heard , this amendment will mean that trade in diesel and petrol with a sulphur content exceeding 10@@ mg/@@ kg will be banned from 2005
The ban will be implemented gradually , with a total prohibition coming into effect from 2009
I think this is a good solution and a good compromise
Whatever your point of view however , although this measure will improve air quality , the production of the new fuels will undoubtedly cause an increase in emissions from refineries
Considerable costs would be incurred too , as it is much more expensive to produce these fuels
It is therefore important for the Commission to assess the progress made
In 2005 it should also revise the date after which only low-sulphur diesel may be sold , especially where diesel agricultural tractors and road vehicles are concerned
This is because diesel vehicles are replaced far less frequently than their petrol counterparts and their fuel consumption is relatively low
There is a risk that the improvements in air quality we all hope for may not be achieved
It should propose new specifications on levels and new testing methods for biofuels and for fuels used by the inshore fleet
Several makes of car are currently able to run on mixtures exceeding 5 %
There are however , no technical standards relating to vehicles of this type
Countries have undertaken to reach specific targets
Though the latter are not set in stone , they ought to be met
If countries are not able to use biofuel mixtures , it will be very difficult for them to do so
Biofuels significantly reduce the emission of greenhouse gases and are a useful way of improving air quality
Congratulations are due also of course to the Commission and the Council
I recommend voting in favour of this report
Madam President , I am last but not least and I hope I shall not take three minutes
On behalf of the Socialist Group , I would welcome the results of the conciliation
We hope this will encourage bringing about change in a pain@@ less way
We also support the need for an on-going review of the situation to ensure progress does not give rise to social or economic problems
We hope that we will now see some genuine results from our endeavours
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a
( The sitting was closed at 11
World hunger and the elimination of barriers to trade with the poorest countries
The next item is the Commission statement on world hunger and the elimination of barriers to trade with the poorest countries
Mr President , I very much regret that the Commissioner is unable to be with us
It seems to me that it might be wise to adjust our arrangements so that the Commissioner himself could read the text to be adopted
He ought to see the agreements reached in the common resolution through
We would then transcend mere words
I am sure we all agree that the terrible scourge of hunger in the world casts shame on all those who are in a position to prevent it
The figures speak for themselves
We are all aware of the alarming statistics
Nonetheless , I believe they bear repetition
I would venture to say that we are numbered amongst the lucky few who live comfortably , in an affluent society
In addition , 800 million people are malnourished and 300 of these are children
What is worse , the numbers remain stubbornly high and we are light years away from reaching the target of halving the number of malnourished people by the year 2015
That was the date set at the 1996 World Food Summit and confirmed in the Millennium Declaration
It is not a particularly ambitious target
Nonetheless , we are unlikely to reach it despite the fact that a number of countries have made determined efforts to reduce poverty and improve food safety
Hunger cannot wait
The time has come to take a quantum leap as regards the strategy needed to rid ourselves of this scourge
We need to go to the very root of the problem if we are to deal with the structural causes of world hunger
Tackling the root of the problem and going beyond the current crisis means making human development a priority
A two-pronged approach is called for
In the short and medium term it is necessary to focus on food safety and food sovereignty , crucial to alleviating present-day hunger
In the longer term , sustainable growth for less-@@ developed countries must be promoted
The causes of hunger and underdevelopment are many and varied
Consequently , a wide range of remedies must be deployed in the effort to reach these twin targets
All the factors contributing to hunger need to be dealt with
Natural disasters , droughts , floods and desertification are but some of these factors
Others include armed conflicts , civil unrest , political , social and economic upheavals , the AIDS pandemic and the foreign debt incurred by the poorest countries
Two main courses of action can be identified
On the one hand , regarding food sovereignty , it is essential to promote small-scale farming of sustainable and diversified crops
This is provided for in the common resolution we trust will be approved in plenary
Urgent action must also be taken to ensure the development of viable networks for local distribution , access to land and to water and the cancellation of foreign debt
Turning to the reduction of poverty and with development in mind , priority should be given to education
I mean education for all , girls included
G@@ ir@@ ls tend to be excluded from educational programmes as a matter of course , and are thus also excluded from all potential development of their countries
Increased technological capacity should also be fostered as part of this drive towards education and training
By technological capacity I am referring in particular to productive capacity
Efforts to combat diseases linked to poverty , notably AIDS , must be stepped up
What I actually have in mind are all the measures designed to promote good governance and the rule of law
As indicated in our resolution , I also believe it is particularly important to facilitate access to the markets on equal terms , and on a reciprocal basis
Measures that distort trade should gradually be done away with
More specifically , as is also stated in the resolution and in line with the agreements reached at Doha , I believe agricultural subsidies should be eliminated
I am not referring merely to the European Union
After all , the Union 's market is the most accessible to the less developed countries
Rather , I am thinking of the whole international community , especially the richer industrialised countries
If we are to set the less developed countries on course for sustainable development to eliminate hunger we cannot shy away from these measures
Peace itself is at stake , at both a social and international level
There have been countless statistical reports
Yet we must openly admit that the international community is not yet doing enough
This is not the central item on our political agenda , as it should be
This is not the main criterion considered by the Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the G8 in their actions
Let us focus on the diseases related to poverty , on malaria and tuberculosis
Prevention is essential but it is not everything
It will be difficult to find excuses in the future for the fact that we do not succeed in treating 95 % of the people suffering from AIDS
Similarly , the decision to grant free access to the European market to products from less developed countries is important
The European Union must now shoulder the responsibility of expressing the principles and positions we are discussing today in all international fora , starting with the World Trade Organisation
Moreover , it is clear to all that , in many cases , barriers to trade are another key factor which needs to be eliminated
That would bring more freedom and , therefore , greater competition and more opportunities in addition to ur@@ gen@@ tly-@@ needed humanitarian measures
This is what the European Parliament is striving for , and I believe we must all support it today
Mr President , the world 's food situation is indeed tragic and is growing increasingly serious
Millions of human beings live in extreme poverty and every hour of the day many die of hunger
It is therefore crucial that rapid and far-reaching measures are adopted in order to put an end to this situation , which must surely weigh on humanity 's conscience
It is therefore crucial that we adopt structural measures that are capable of preventing conflicts arising
It is equally crucial to follow up these fundamental measures with emergency measures to save lives now
The emergency humanitarian aid that has been provided to date has proved to be inadequate , where both food and medical supplies are concerned
Mr President , there is famine upon famine in Africa
We are appalled to see children dying of hunger , but we do not tackle the causes
The use of food aid is not a viable solution
It then has the audacity to accuse governments which refuse this aid of allowing their populations to die
To use such blackmail on vulnerable people is shameful
It goes against the fundamental right to food , which gives all human beings the freedom to choose what they eat
In some of these countries or regions , the food crisis is not a general crisis
The problem is not necessarily the lack of food , but rather the fact that it is not distributed fairly throughout the world
Only local production and intra-@@ regional trade are sustainable and able to guarantee access to food for everyone
The European Union , however , ext@@ ols the virtues of free trade at world level and forces the developing countries to open their markets
In the same way , the current crisis among coffee producers is a reminder that free trade means that small farmers are being ruined while the big multinationals prosper
Free trade is not fair trade
Moreover , there is no reference to fair trade in the new Commission Communication entitled ' Trade and development ' , which Parliament will shortly have occasion to examine
President Lul@@ a made the fight against hunger his top priority
He is proposing to create an international fund for this purpose
That is also the objective of the FAO , whose recent summit does not seem to have had any significant impact
Mr President , this resolution contains a long list of excellent observations and proposals
There is almost no aspect of the problem that it does not discuss
That being said , we must , however , state that our arrangements so far have been quite inadequate
We also state in this resolution that the gap between developed and developing countries became wider during the 1990s
I think it important to emphasise three shortcomings of the resolution
Secondly , the resolution contains no discussion of the internal states of affairs that prevent people in the developing countries from living in freedom
We reco@@ il from removing those dictators who destroy people 's living conditions and the structures of their countries
Only the United States is prepared to remove the op@@ pressors by force
It is disgraceful that we are in no position to take more far-reaching decisions in this area
Developing countries that are in crisis are a good reason to call for more attention to be paid to the food shortage and its relationship with trade
The resolution deals with problems that lie at the root of the crisis of which the food shortage is the persistent result
The global economic recession is certainly taking its toll
Economic decline hits poor countries hardest
This concept is extremely relevant to the relationship between hunger and trade , although it is not mentioned in the joint resolution
Was debt cancellation not agreed in the context of the ' jubil@@ e@@ e year ' 2000 ?
No more than half of the debt cancellations promised in 2000 have been realised to date
This is directly linked to trade , as exports are often used to pay off foreign debts
Thirdly , there is the risk of going over the top in the quest for liberalisation
The resolution asks for developing countries to be given the leeway to make their sectors sufficiently strong before tackling international competition , and rightly so
Pres@@ cri@@ bing one-sided protection measures is going too far , however
This request for a sensible method and degree of liberalisation shows the sense in controlling the WTO process , a point that the resolution is right to touch on
It would be better if this control was carried out in a national context rather than by international institutions
The minister is , after all , responsible and appro@@ ac@@ hable
the WTO members determine the course of trade liberalisation
Responsibility therefore lies primarily on that level; it is also most clear-cut there and forms part of national policy with which the citizen can identify
Conversely , this clarity is much less evident in international bodies with a large number of players and interests , such as a parliamentary assembly
Fourthly , there are of course also factors that fall under the sphere of influence of developing countries themselves , such as good management and a strong economic structure
The AC@@ S Agreement has not yet resulted in this diversification in the exports of the least developed countries
I would like to find out what the European Commission 's strategy is with regard to actual diversification and what efforts it is making to achieve this
I am pleased that the Commissioner has arrived , as I would like to address this question to him
Another point of ongoing concern is HIV/AIDS and the disastrous effects this has on the body , social relationships and the economic structure
In this regard I would specifically like to ask to what extent the European Commission uses the highly preventative effect created by mar@@ ital fi@@ de@@ lity
Finally , I would like to say that the resolution is to a certain extent bogged down in highlighting problems and does not mention any strong approaches to their resolution
Because of the balanced approach to the issues in the problem , the resolution nevertheless gets my support
The Commissioner has , at last , arrived , having survived the traffic jams
Mr President , I am very happy to hear what Commissioner Nielson has to say , although I feel that we should have been talking to Commissioner Lamy today
You see , I believe that opening up the markets is , in political terms , more costly than granting aid
suffice it to say that the operative part contains 27 items
That is to say it sets out the sum total of human knowledge on world hunger , AIDS , poverty and so on
It retains some important points , in particular the Commission 's request to step up the implementation of the ' Everything But Arms ' initiative by the end of 2003
If abolishing duties has a purpose - and it does - in the fight against poverty , then please let us do it now
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the times when large parts of Europe suffered from hunger are over , thank God
I therefore very much welcome the fact that Parliament is once again drawing attention to this catastrophic situation and backing strategies to fight it
Ladies and gentlemen , food aid to areas in crisis is too little in itself for a sustainable strategy
Building up capacities that will help people to help themselves must be regarded as a key element
The unconditional opening of the European Union 's agricultural markets , which is called for by many , is not the only panacea for conqu@@ ering hunger in the developing countries
St@@ able prices are important for farmers in the South as in the North
Rather , I see support for the building of national and regional markets as a practicable way of reducing these countries ' dependence on the industrialised nations
Mr President , we must continue to pursue a sustainable interregional strategy that puts the needs of the population to the fore
At the same time , however , we must help the developing countries to meet the EU 's important food safety standards by taking public and plant health measures
In this connection , strategies will have to be devised to encourage private sector investment and development
Finally , Mr President , I would like to expressly say that a great deal of attention needs to be paid to preventing fraud particularly in connection with development aid
I am very pleased that we have found so broad a consensus here in this joint resolution
Unfortunately this proposal was seriously toned down for rice and sugar at the time and was postponed following pressure by the European sugar industry and sugar-@@ producing countries
This has to do with the construction of water systems , good environmental management and the participation of local farmers
With external help , the local systems were repaired after the floods
The link with European agricultural protectionism is nevertheless very distressing in this case as well
Under normal circumstances , Mozambique would earn as much from her sugar production on the world market as she now receives in international aid
The situation is not normal , however , as consumer prices are artificially high in Europe , and are therefore ruining the world market
This naturally requires a restructuring of our industry , including a social plan
Our refusal to break through our protectionism structurally undermines poor countries ' own food supplies
We must continue to buy from the regions themselves as an absolute priority , even if the price is slightly higher
In short , our proposals to turn Doha into a development round require more than the current Commission proposals
The Commission has proposed cutting export subsidies by 45 % , but in Doha we were talking about abolition
For@@ ty-five per cent is only a start , and things must go a lot faster
This is of great importance when it comes to bridging the gap between the developed and the developing world
The help of the EU is very important in this regard
Europe now gives with the one hand and takes away with the other
It is high time Europe started making a difference and really started cooperating with these countries
The Commission could decide to set about solving these problems
Unfortunately , I am afraid that the method it has chosen is once again not the right one
The UN@@ DP report for 2002 reminds us that if the process continues at the present snail 's pace , it will take more than 130 years to abolish hunger
World hunger requires more than an urgent appeal by rich countries to poor countries , asking them to fall in with the laws laid down by the WTO
This is where the intervention of the European Union could be useful
There is an urgent need to encourage the local production of food crops by encouraging access to land , water and biodiversity resources
There is also an urgent need to cancel the debts
Mr President , Commissioner , protectionism is always cited as a reason for hunger in the world
There is no doubt some truth in that , but trade does not fill stom@@ ach@@ s
Trade does not make people rich , either , ladies and gentlemen , at any rate not always both sides
If we are speaking of the debts of developing world countries , then the reason for those debts is unequal trade
If we talk about people being hungry , we have to see that 80 % of the hungry live in rural areas
How are the hungry to export food to Europe when they have nothing to eat themselves ?
We must ask who trades with Europe , in what goods and on what terms ?
Europe is the biggest importer of food
Then we shall see economies developing
If , however , we say we will exploit these countries with low prices , then we will destroy rural agriculture both here and there
We must also see to it that land is made available to the people in these countries
Who will take responsibility for it ?
Who will teach the people how to work the land ?
We ought to be addressing these questions and stop thinking we can help these people fill their stom@@ ach@@ s simply by opening the borders
Mr President , the statistics in relation to world hunger are indeed staggering
By the time it takes to discuss this topic , almost one thousand people will have died of hunger somewhere in the world - the majority of them in Africa
At the present time , there are about 800 million people in the world who do not have enough food and this includes 300 million children
Perhaps the most frightening aspect of all of this is that the situation is not improving
I do not refer simply to food aid
I accept that the EU is the world 's largest donor of development aid
We need to look at the root causes of poverty and hunger so these can be tackled and thereby eliminated in the long-term
In terms of creating a fair trading system , the EU has made a significant contribution with its ' everything but arms ' initiative
We have committed ourselves to fully eliminating the customs duties applied to the export of the world 's 48 poorest countries
Mr President , at the present time , of the 6 billion inhabitants of the world , over 800 million are suffering from malnutrition
All they can do is to cut off their intern@@ al-@@ consumption reserves permanently in order to try and save , more often than not without success , their production potential
How can we release them from this vicious circle ?
According to this principle , each country or group of countries should be free to determine how it supplies its people with food
Food sovereignty means the recognition of people 's right to feed themselves and their right to feed themselves as they want to
It means the opportunity for developing countries to achieve food autonomy by developing their agriculture
Firstly , the agricultural development programmes that it is financing in the developing countries will all have to include a section that provides aid for the marketing of food products
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the figures are tragically eloquent in describing the North@@ /South divide
This summit should lead us to draw lessons for the EU 's internal policies
The EU delegation was actually the only one to set out for Johannesburg with a negotiating agenda , which became the Conference 's sole agenda
I want to focus this morning particularly on the Economic Partnership Agreement negotiations which are now taking place between the EU and the ACP
40 out of the 78 ACP countries are least-developed countries , 38 have very serious levels of poverty and several others are particularly vulnerable as small island and land-@@ locked states
As you know , there are severe supply-@@ side restraints that they face as well
Eastern European countries are receiving billions of euros to upgrade food-@@ processing standards before they join the EU
You know very well that the ACP will have great difficulty in meeting the phy@@ to@@ sanitary and sanitary conditions that will be a necessary part of the future relationship
I trust that they will get at least as much support for their efforts to upgrade the processes that they have
Mr President , Commissioner , two contrasting worlds coexist on our planet
In one of these worlds , hunger , AIDS and poverty are rampant
In the other , the world we live in , people die from high cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol
On the one hand , there is the developed world , bent on identifying axes of evil and launching wars which can only result in further devastation and poverty
Export refunds for surplus production destined to the poorest countries is the cru@@ ell@@ est of all our policies
It runs counter to solidarity and should only be applied in the case of over-@@ protected and more developed markets
Hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y cannot be condon@@ ed though
We must not cast all responsibility on to the weakest sector in Europe , namely the traditional European agricultural sector , which has the lowest income in the Community
It is not for this sector to provide solutions to the problem of world hunger
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the statistics are now arriving thick and fast regarding what is , to say the least , a tragic situation
According to the statistics , it has more than doubled in the last 30 years , and this is what should really concern us
The undertaking by governments and private parties to making these countries self-sufficient no longer su@@ ffic@@ es , and is barely coping with circumstances , with the daily emergency
The economies therefore contract under the burden of public and international debts
that day , almost a third of the large , huge public debt of these countries was discharged
Unfortunately , this result went unnoticed because of the ri@@ oting in the streets which attracted all the mass media 's attention
The Commission really must substantially boost programmes devoted to them
Mr President , others have spoken about rich and poor countries , about the prosperity we have in Europe and the quite contrasting conditions in lesser-@@ developed countries
Mr Bautista Ojeda was speaking about that just a moment ago
We can do far more about this than we are actually doing at the moment
We can do more by helping those countries
It is not just about huge amounts of development mon@@ ey@@ ; the aid needs to be sustainable
One thing that we can do to help those countries would be to look again at our common agricultural policy - looking to reform that
At the moment , we are dumping subsidised goods on lesser-@@ developed countries , which does not help their community , economy or farmers at all
We protect our own agricultural community in Europe at the cost of other countries
Whilst we are subsidising our agriculture , farmers and poorer people in countries all around the world are going under because they are unable to compete
So we must look at the common agricultural policy
We must work with the WTO to make sure that the standards and the conditions that they set do not contribute to poverty
We can do more then we are doing at the moment
Mr President , there is enough food in the world to feed everyone
Naturally , it would help if crop yields were higher - but this is not , I repeat , not the essence of the hunger problem
Free and in particular fair trade also helps , but that is not the essence either
The essence is the distribution problem
There is no hunger in countries with a parliamentary democracy , even if they are poor countries
The political rulers know that they can be voted out
With political dictatorships it is different
Take Zimbabwe , for example
The best solution is the promotion of democracy throughout the world
This aspect is too often lacking in the European strategy
Mr President , the gap between the rich , the poor and the poorest countries of all has been growing since the 1990s
One drawback of the European Union 's policy on developing countries has been the promotion in many places of autonomous production in those countries
At the same time the export of heavily subsidised European agricultural products is harming or destroying local production
Besides removing barriers to trade we also have to promote the spread of fair trade products in the Union
The Commission has supported information campaigns for fair trade products , but at the same time has said their high prices will only fall if demand for them grows
The EU should calculate the threshold price for fair trade products and raise the threshold prices for other products from developing countries
A drop in fair trade threshold prices would help them to sell in the EU
That in turn would increase the volume of production in the developing countries
Then production would move more in the direction of fair trade
At the same time the Developing Countries Fund should be used to support in particular the farms that go over to operating under the fair trade sign
Low@@ -@@ interest loans and development aid should be granted to develop these farms so as to organise training and education programmes for those who are left jobless , especially women
We make donations and organise collec@@ tions to prevent famine , but often forget that it is we who cause those fam@@ ines with the import duties we impose
Member States should also favour fair trade products in public procurement , with increasing demand resulting in lower costs and lower retail prices
Global crop production cannot be increased by making the amount of land available for cultivation greater
S@@ car@@ cer water resources also have an impact
Increased large-scale irrigation is no longer possible
If food production cannot be increased we must change the basis for its distribution as well as our trading relations
Apart from the uneven distribution of food , one of the reasons for famine that might be mentioned is often an unstable political situation
The capacity of governments for confronting this crisis is totally non-existent
Fam@@ ine must be averted through social remedies as well as political and economic ones
Often it is mainly women who suffer from famine
Parliament 's political groups have drafted a joint motion for a resolution on the statement by the Commission
There is therefore very firm political backing for aid for the victims of famine and for financial support for the developing countries
This should also be visible in the policies of the Commission and the Council
My worst fear is that once again in issues relating to the developing countries there will be fewer deeds than words
Behind theoretical speech there is a whole real world
They are real people , not dum@@ m@@ ies
They have a pain threshold
Mr President , in Europe , every day , every cow receives on average EUR 2 from the European Union
over 2 billion men and women do not have as much as that to live on
I believe that strict monitoring is essential in order to ensure that regional integration , economic diversification and food security can be guaranteed in these developing countries
Some of us have just come back from Porto Alegre
If this policy produces results , it will open up new prospects not only for development but also for hopes of democracy
What are we going to do to support Brazil , to help it to make this experiment a success ?
In the IMF , are we going to continue to require these countries to achieve an annual surplus of 3
We have a problem with consistency here
Finally , President Lul@@ a launched an appeal , at Porto Alegre and at Davos , for the creation of a major worldwide fund to combat hunger and poverty
That would be a practical response and a strong political signal
Mr President , Commissioner , we can only welcome the campaigns to fight hunger in the developing countries
The official statements , all of which have been quoted in today 's resolution , must now be followed up with further , and very definite , measures
There is no doubt a great variety of ways out of the poverty trap in the less developed countries
As a member of the European Parliament 's ACP delegation , the removal of barriers to trade with the poorest countries concerns me greatly
The number of people in the developing countries who have less than one dollar a day to live on continues to grow
De@@ ep public concern has long since ceased to be enough
Wars , repeated disasters , international crime , drug dealing , economic stagnation , illegal immigration and premature death , ladies and gentlemen , are but a few among them
Mr President , I have almost finished
Of course we must improve market access for agricultural products from the developing countries
But we should also point out that other highly developed countries in this world really must make greater efforts too
As a member of the ACP delegation I support the work of this resolution as a whole
Mr President , it is a sad day when you realise that , after fifty years of development aid , not one country has escaped the underdevelopment and poverty trap
Many maintain that globalisation is the root cause of the state of the economy in the poorest countries
The truth is that the North 's protectionist policy has helped to str@@ angle crucial sectors in the South
The contention that poor countries can achieve the same levels of income as rich countries without international trade , without incoming capital and investment , is quite simply nonsense
If the poor countries make do with what is in their coffers or wait to develop their own technological capabilities , it will take them forever
There is no such thing as true progress in a society where few become richer and many become poorer
Hunger and abject poverty mainly affect women , making sexual inequality a huge barrier to development
Over the last decade , the number of women living in absolute poverty has risen
This is linked to reproductive health problems , because it is the poorest women that have the least access to health services and the most unwanted babies
The probability of a woman dying in these circumstances is less than one in three thousand in the developed world , compared to one in nine@@ teen in Africa
These figures prove that the benefits of globalisation have still not reached that many people
Continu@@ ing poverty is holding back this process through open trade
Mr President , I would like to express my thanks for the way you have handled my unfortunate problems getting here this morning
Well , we all have to face the reality that coherence starts at home
I think Parliament itself should do more to ensure that the nice , correct analysis presented by all parties here is representative of the whole House
The dark forces of agriculture in Europe are not only working in certain governments
This game is also going on in this House
We all have a responsibility
As I say , I share the analysis
The problem of food insecurity or the inadequate mix or quality of the food is bigger than the number of people who are , in that sense , really starving
It goes without saying that all these problems are directly linked to poverty
They are not anywhere near a mone@@ tar@@ ised economy and do not have anything interesting to offer in terms of cash crops
They do not get services as such
This is a long-term structural effect showing that neglect , poverty and marginalisation are the real problems
More trade , the big global discussion , does not immediately help these people
It is another layer , so to speak
So far , and this is a figure we can be proud of , 99
1 % of what the European Commission has been providing in the southern African food crisis has been bought in the region
This makes sense
But there is a de-@@ linkage between those actually playing in a market as agricultural producers and those simply feeding themselves , if they can
In terms of money and resources , this is not very challenging or problematic
The big problem is to move them into something that reaches somewhat outside their own non-@@ mone@@ tar@@ ised subsistence economy
The discussion on ' everything but arms ' should be continued in the manner we are doing today
A lot of work needs to be done before we can aspire to earning the headline of being a development round
To Mr Souchet I would say that the food sovereignty notion makes a lot of sense but sufficiency is not the only way to do it
But to say that protectionism and the right to subsidise agricultural production is a good idea is something I would warn against
It is more important to open up between neighbours , also in this area
Any way of stimulating the emergence of market mechanisms regionally is a key to getting things rolling
Mrs Kinnock 's remarks about the economic partnership agreement negotiations highlighted the need to make our ACP partners more aware of their responsibility in moving this agenda forward
The phy@@ to@@ sanitary constraints , and different elements such as capacity building on trade negotiation , are not really a problem in terms of money made available
The real problem is to define adequate , good , specific fund@@ able projects and ideas
For phy@@ to@@ sanitary standards in fisheries we also have ongoing large programmes
We hope to see a flow of ideas from the reality out there which can materialise in fund@@ able actions
That is the architecture of how we would like to accelerate what we do here
Mr Santini said that NGOs did more than all the western governments together
I agree that NGOs are extremely important , especially in the area of humanitarian aid but also generally
They sometimes have great difficulty , and are extremely shy , in telling the public how they are funded
Unfortunately , I never even received an answer
That does not change our relationship but I urge Parliament to help me insist on some reality when it comes to visibility
It is difficult for our own public to understand what the money is really used for when it is shi@@ el@@ ded in this way
One remark for Mrs Schierhuber , who said that fraud in development aid is a problem
In the case of our development cooperation work , it is not that big a problem
I admit that , technically , fund@@ ability is here to stay , as it provides more flexibility in the budget
That being said , our general track record and ability to trace and document is quite good
You remember when the Ivory Coast was playing around with money and the hammer fell
They paid back and that is how the pi@@ ano plays
I should like to dispel the notion that development cooperation in itself is a problem , as this is not the case
It is also why following and delivering on Monterrey is important
Finally , I should like to say to Mr Santini that if Italy were to move from the previous and current level of 0
To wind up the debate , I have received six motions for a resolution
The aid organisations have been warning of a large-scale disaster since September
The fact that even this Parliament is only paying attention to this five months later says a great deal
Nevertheless , I am pleased about this resolution
I have two thoughts on the issue
The rich countries must naturally come up with resources to relieve the distress more quickly and more generously
Secondly , starvation must not be used as an excuse to push genetically modified food
In the European Union , the approval of GMOs is subject to stringent requirements , and rightly so
In Africa , the uncontrolled dumping of GMOs could have far-reaching consequences , in particular for the environment , agriculture and food safety
Even the mil@@ ling of genetically modified grain is not a watertight solution
In Zimbabwe , the stores were plundered as soon as the food arrived
The assertion that there is not enough non-GM food available is not correct
India has 65 million tonnes of grain available immediately
During the Cold War , food aid was used as a political and commercial weapon
The real global scandal of hunger in the world forces us to react
In that sense , the European ' Everything but arms ' initiative is to be welcomed
The example of the coffee crisis , however , demonstrates that this is not enough
This raises the question of stabilising the prices of raw materials
Tens of thousands of people , including those who were at Porto Alegre , have proclaimed their desire to see a world that is more fair
The Braz@@ ili@@ an President , by declaring that his priority is ' Zero Hunger ' , has generated an enormous feeling of hope
The European Union must respond to this aspiration and to those hopes
At least five million people died in the world 's poor countries during last year alone
These three diseases are different by nature , and different types of effort are required to prevent them and cure people of them
They have one thing in common , however
They first and foremost affect the poor people of the world
It is therefore logical to coordinate aid when it comes to combating them
We in Parliament have for many years demanded that the Commission should increase its efforts in the health sphere
Commissioner Nielson deserves recognition for having made the fight against these diseases a priority within the EU
The regulation we are discussing here today is extraordinarily important
It provides the framework for the way in which the programme of measures is to be implemented
An important aspect is the Commission 's own programme
It is important for adequate resources in terms of personnel to be set aside so that the programme is effective
The other aspect is the EU 's contribution to the Global Health Fund which has recently been set up
Large parts of the Commission 's proposal for a regulation are constructive
We have conducted parallel discussions with the Council in an attempt to reach unanimity at first reading , an objective I hope will be achieved
Vi@@ g@@ orous endeavours to prevent these diseases cannot take place in a vacuum
That is why , secondly , it is so important , parallel with these efforts , purely and simply to strengthen the health systems in the poor countries
Coordination with other donors is emphasised
The same naturally applies to coordination with those working in the area of reproductive health and family planning
In the report , we stress how important it is for countries that have been hit hard by these diseases to be able to import cheap and generic medicines
It is sad to see that this issue has still not been resolved in spite of long and intensive negotiations within the WTO
We consider the budget appropriation to be inadequate , given the needs that exist
C@@ alcul@@ ations have shown that ten billion dollars a year would be required in order effectively to combat these three diseases
At present , just a couple of billion dollars are being invested
What counts , of course , is what is needed for doing the actual work on combating disease
During the vote , I shall table an additional proposal that is necessary if our decision is to be in accordance with the new rules governing the budget
I am convinced that we must soon discuss further contributions to this work , and mainly the issue of ' fresh ' new money
I myself was recently in Kenya and saw how badly just one poor country had been hit by these problems
When as many as 20 to 30 % of a country 's people are infected , the consequences are disastrous
Mind you , it is not only Africa that has been affected
Rather , we are now seeing a rapid spread of disease in countries such as India and China too
These three diseases will constitute a serious problem for a long time to come
Sixty years is a long time
After just 20 years , more than 40 million people have now already been affected
The imagination is barely capable of understanding the consequences of another 60 years of a gall@@ oping HIV epidemic
Those are reasons enough for strongly supporting today 's report
Our proposal for a regulation on poverty diseases was adopted last March
The Commission places high priority on health questions and development , and has presented a programme of action to counter HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis
I think we are agreed on the importance of improving health in developing countries
I would just remind you that the reality of budget support linked to results in health matters , and indeed education , logically forms the missing link in these discussions
The situation is improving and I just wanted to reiterate this point in the ongoing discussion
The Commission can accept all the amendments voted by the Development Committee , as they strengthen and clarify the text of the regulation without altering the main objectives
There are also some up@@ -@@ dates made to references in the Commission 's original proposal which we are happy to accept
These amendments reflect constructive collaboration between the Council and Parliament and the Commission
The rapporteur has now submitted an amendment presenting a proposal for EUR 3@@ 51 million for the years 2003 to 2006
We , Parliament , the Council and the Commission , have agreed substantial increases for this budget line in 2003 compared to the 2002 budget line for HIV/AIDS
During the December Plenary Session , an amendment was adopted which increased the 2003 budget allocation to EUR 80
A financial declaration agreed by the three institutions specifies that EUR 42 million is to go to the global fund and the remaining EUR 38
We will also propose a further substantial contribution from the EDF for the global fund against HIV/AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria
Ladies and gentlemen , I must point out to you that a further 26 minutes of this debate remain
Provided we keep to the timetable , there is time for all the groups to have the floor for the time requested
I am sure you will understand that I need to be very strict over speaking time
I would ask you all please to remain silent out of respect for the speaker , otherwise the debate will become much more complicated
However , there are one or two amendments that cause some difficulties
I hope that all the groups in this House will support this approach because objecting to the oral amendment will only lead to referral back and delay
Moving on to this figure , we have to recognise the constraints in the financial perspective that we have at the moment
Unless we use the flexibility instrument , it will be very difficult for us to meet the amounts stated
We do not want to give with one hand and take away with the other
any funding should be additional
HIV , tuberculosis and malaria are the world 's greatest killers and are the most serious diseases affecting the world today
Nearly six million people have died
So much EU funding is used for intangible issues , and I hope we will support this report
Mr President , the action programme to counter poverty diseases which the European Union is setting up is vital , but it must be complete
The people in the South are still dying of HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , but our words speak louder than our actions
These people also suffer from den@@ gue , tr@@ y@@ pan@@ o@@ som@@ o@@ ses and other fil@@ ari@@ ases , but I am sad to say that nothing is being done to combat these diseases
Above all I deplore the informal procedure which has prevailed until today 's debate
What happened to those European declarations emphasising health before profits ?
The Commission had seemed to be receptive to Parliament 's arguments as long as they were not binding
Faced with this legislative regulation , however , its attitude changed
By an ironic tw@@ ist of fate , this bad agreement was rejected by the United States , which wanted to reduce its scope even further
In conclusion , I would say that we should adopt this regulation as a matter of urgency , but not at the price of democracy
We Members of the European Parliament are here not to promote our own selfish interests , but to promote the interests of the citizens of the world
HIV rates have increased by 100 % in the United Kingdom in the last year to 5 000 cases
TB has increased by 200 % to 7 300 reported cases
The London Bor@@ ough of B@@ rent now has a higher rate of TB than China and twice that of Brazil
26 300 he@@ pati@@ tis B infections were reported in the last four years in London alone
One person in 50 in east London has he@@ pati@@ tis B - the same level as in Nepal
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , we have been waiting for this regulation
It should enable us , at last , to launch the European Union 's action plan on HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis in the countries of the South
By means of Mr Wijkman 's report , we have to decide on two fundamental public health issues in the countries of the South
First of all , there is the issue of the financial resources which the European Union will be devoting to the fight against these three diseases in the coming years
The second issue at stake in this regulation is the political support expressed by the European Union for the countries of the South in their struggle to promote public health
On this point , the Committee on Development and Cooperation has done a good job
It will also contain a reference to the facilitation of access to medicines in developing countries by making those medicines available at the lowest possible prices
However , this political support from the European Union should , above all , be expressed and manifested to the WTO in no uncertain terms
In this respect I deplore the failure of the negotiations of last December on the clarification of Article 31 of the intellectual property agreements
In order to escape from this impasse , the European Union must unreservedly support the proposals of the countries of the South
That is the request , Commissioner , which I am asking you to pass on to Commissioner Lamy
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , first of all I would like to compliment the rapporteur , Mr Wijkman , on his outstanding report
Pover@@ ty-@@ related diseases are a serious threat to the development of poor countries , and we have the important task of helping these countries fight these diseases
There are calls to increase this amount
Despite the useful work they do , I myself do not endorse this directly
I think that it is very important to first take a look at what happens to the contribution
We must have the guarantee that the money will be spent properly and efficiently
Transparency plays a major role in this
I therefore wholeheartedly endorse the rapporteur 's proposal to include the actions financed from the World Fund in the Commission 's annual report
I myself also believe that the pharmaceutical industry has an important role to play
Not only must they offer affordable prices , they must also be willing to share their know-how with partners in developing countries
So there will be fewer logistical problems , and the TRIPs do not have to be an obstacle to this , given the Doha Declaration
Finally , in order to ensure that we can combat poverty effectively , I would also argue for more attention to be paid to informing the population
It is extremely important that patients realise that once a course of treatment has begun it must be finished
How often do you hear the complaint that a patient with malaria has contracted a resistant variant because he stopped his course of treatment too soon out of ignorance
We must pay the necessary attention to this as well
Information and education must be spear@@ heads in our development policy , also in relation to combating poverty-@@ related diseases
The pharmaceutical industry can make a formidable contribution to this
We are of course all aware of the urgency and gravity of the situation
Five million people die each year of one of these three diseases
Almost 40 million people are infected by AI@@ D@@ S@@ /@@ HIV , and 90 % of them live in developing countries , most of those - 70 % - in sub-Saharan Africa
We are also seeing tuberculosis making a com@@ e@@ back
As for malaria , which re@@ appeared in the seventies , it is once again affecting countries in which it had been eradicated
There is no need to say any more , except that the European Union owes it to itself to adopt , quickly , a strategy to combat these diseases effectively
The regulation that we are discussing here defines the framework for Community action
It also creates the legal basis for Europe 's contribution , the aim being to encourage research to develop medicines , treatments and vaccines and to facilitate access to them
This is absolutely vital , because only 10 % of research activities concern diseases which are responsible for 90 % of disease in the world
We therefore need to carry out public research and encourage the private sector to invest in it
Finally , we must ensure that the prices are not prohibitive , and here we come back to the problem of intellectual property
I support this report , Mr President , and I hope that it will be adopted at first reading
Therefore , although this is a global problem , it nevertheless affects developing countries in particular
Given the scale and cross-border nature of the phenomenon - now on our doorstep - these poverty diseases call for a systematic response from the whole international community
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to confine my remarks to the subject of HIV/AIDS
The World Pop@@ ulation Report for 2002 , which has just appeared , contains some shocking figures
It is now the common@@ est cause of death in Sub@@ -@@ Saharan Africa
To date , more than 60 million people worldwide have become infected and around 22 million of them have died
Of the 40 million persons infected , 95 % live in developing countries and nearly three quarters of them in Africa
Out of 5@@ 80 000 children below the age of 15 who have died from AIDS , 500 000 - almost 90 % - lived in Africa
I could continue with these statistics of misery indefinitely
This catalogue of disasters is not only the sum of millions of human tragedies , however , but it is something that affects whole societies
Life expectancy is falling , education is severely affected , agricultural output is declining , and the social and economic fabric is being eroded
Plans for fighting HIV/AIDS must not be confined to the health aspects
What is needed is an integral strategy with wide-ranging education and prevention campaigns
Those who are already infected are entitled to the best possible treatment
We carry some responsibility for that
It is also up to us to provide the necessary knowledge , awareness and , of course , the necessary resources for prevention and treatment
Because once a person is infected , that cannot be reversed
malaria and tuberculosis can be cu@@ red , AIDS cannot
AIDS can be avoided , however , and that is worth every effort
Ladies and gentlemen , I would be grateful if you would remain silent
The speakers deserve your consideration
Please be silent , or I shall be forced to request the ushers to clear the corridors at the rear
The proposals that have been put forward fall far short of what the problem requires
The rapporteur , moreover , emphasises the ridiculously low priority which the research and development community accords to health problems in developing countries
He points out that only 10 % of research activity concerns diseases which are responsible for 90 % of disease in the world
He adds that when there is a failure of the market public research should be encouraged
Mr President , congratulations to the European Commission for making the programme for action against communicable diseases with its legal base in this area a priority
But shame on the Commission for seeking to get the UN global funds on the cheap
Shame on this Parliament for voting against increases in funds devoted to reproductive health , which is integral to the fight against the spread of HIV
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report which has been presented here today is fundamental , and I hope it will receive Members ' attention
tuberculosis , HIV/AIDS and malaria have become real obstacles to the development of the poorest countries and every day we see shocking examples of this
A Commission initiative which is inclined to allocate only EUR 300 million to combat these diseases is therefore welcome , albeit somewhat feeble
I shall therefore ask the Commission and the Council to take this matter seriously and to act more consistently
They also need to be more consistent by ensuring that this proposed regulation also provides for the supply of medicines at affordable prices
Remember that the WTO negotiations have still not enabled us to achieve this result in the case of those countries which do not have the capacity to produce medicines themselves
We might well , therefore , ask ourselves sometimes whether the Commissioners ever talk to one another
Mr President , Commissioners do talk to each other and sometimes even write to each other
I maintain that what we have achieved in this field of communicable diseases represents a good illustration of the Commission working across the different areas of responsibility
This initiative would never have been launched and achieved its results without that work attitude
I agree that the pharmaceutical companies are not doing enough in this area from the point of view of global poverty
We will work with them and are of course already in contact with them , as this makes sense
As a Commissioner , I have to tell you that the Commission does not print money
We have to work within the constraints of the budget and the perspective as defined by the budgetary authority as a whole
we cannot accept the amendment regarding the EUR 3@@ 51 million
On behalf of the House , I must apologise for the continual mur@@ m@@ uring
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at 11 a
Mr President , last year Parliament adopted a new version of our Rules of Procedure
While working on this report , the Committee on Budgets was consulted , but at an early stage before the budget amounts had been finally agreed upon
We managed to reach agreement with the Council and with the Commission about an increase in the budget early in January
Ideally , the Committee on Budgets should have been consulted again at a later stage and I am sorry this did not take place
To remedy the situation so as to comply with the Rules of Procedure , I am proposing an oral amendment both to the legislative text and to the resolution
I have of course discussed the amendment with the chair of the Committee on Budgets , Ter@@ ry Wynn , and he agrees
Mr Wijkman 's reference to an agreement with the Commission services early in January does not cover the reality concerning the Commission 's ability to accept this amendment
Mr President , because I was looking behind me to see that everyone was voting , I failed to vote myself
We will make a note of that
Someone once said ' I am their leader , I must follow them
Mr President , would you please ensure that the German version of Amendment No 9 is corrected ?
It should not read ' Demo@@ k@@ rati@@ e@@ k@@ om@@ ittee '
That is an incorrect translation
It is not intended to have a formalised character , but to remain an informal matter
Therefore please amend the German text; the English is the correct text
We will ensure that all language versions correspond
For those people who might be confused by the word ' forced ' , it refers , of course , to prostitution and not to child labour
Mr President , in the light of current events , could Burma - or Myanmar - also be included on the list of countries cited as examples ?
Mr President , I wish to point out that part of paragraph 16 is missing in the Spanish version
I believe your attention has already been drawn to this omission , but I would like this to be noted in the Minutes
Thank you for drawing that to our attention
Once again , we will ensure that all the language versions correspond
Mr President , we wish to table an oral amendment to the fourth in@@ dent
The wording of the Spanish text currently refers to when action is taken with a view to appropri@@ ating natural resources illegally
including action taken to appropriate such resources illegally
I have had the pleasure of Your Ex@@ cell@@ ency also hearing my explanations of vote
I therefore welcome Mr Marco P@@ ann@@ ella , who will be speaking about Iraq
So might this be a report against the monarchy ?
While I was day@@ dreaming about this over a coffee this morning , I sp@@ ilt my drink on my tr@@ ous@@ ers
Might this report - which , in reality , seeks to recover EUR 2
As I was just saying , Mr President , this morning I was drinking a coffee in the Members ' bar on the third floor
However , I forgot to add any sugar
That coffee was so bitter
Having supported the Directive on public access to environmental information , today we are supporting public participation in environmental programmes
This text will have the onerous task of making decision making more transparent and involving local populations in projects that affect their health and their environment
We can congratulate the rapporteur and the conciliation committee on their work
It is imperative that the obligation be laid on environmental authorities to inform the public of decisions taken and of the reasons for them
It is essential that we ensure that the time limits laid down for participation in public enquiries are sufficient to enable the people to prepare for them
Two of the provisions , however , are not acceptable as they stand
First of all training the public in decision-making is the role of associations
Having read the text , that is a risk that cannot be ruled out
I welcome the outcome of the conciliation process , which I believe to be extremely satisfactory
At the same time it attempts to harmonise Community legislation , thereby representing a significant step towards the European Union 's ratification of the Aarhus Convention
The authorities are thereby instructed to inform the public on the decisions they have taken and of the reasons and considerations that have led them to take these decisions
I voted in favour of this Conciliation Delegation Report but with some misgivings
The planning process is a key element of sustainable development as , because it covers land-use , it sets the physical framework for the way in which we live
This is another democratic deficit
' Here 's the new nuclear power station
Neither do they allow for third parties to be involved in the full process
This potentially removes expertise from the procedure and does not fulfil the sustainability objective of all of us having responsibility for our environment
Overall , however , I welcome the inclusion of the granting of certain operating permits in these Directives and the great accountability required of decision-making bodies
I welcome the outcome of this conciliation process , which concludes the preparation of the second of three directives on environmental citizenship
I advocate a real citizen 's control of our environmental heritage
30 in the morning - it was snow@@ ing
The snow was falling in large fla@@ kes
Mrs Hautala 's report on the quality of petrol and diesel will have serious financial consequences for farms and forestry sites , for several reasons
First of all , by extending the fuel quality standards applying to all road vehicles to non-road mobile machinery
In my opinion , this measure comes under the Non-@@ Road M@@ obile Mach@@ inery Directive
Secondly , by lowering sulphur levels for non-road mobile machinery , which will result in a price increase of 8 to 10 % per litre
This measure , by increasing the number of different qualities of diesel on the market , will pose considerable logistical problems without providing any real environmental benefit
I welcome the outcome achieved by the Conciliation Committee and congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work
The environmental costs must be borne by the economy and fiscal policy is one of the most effective instruments to achieve these aims
I have therefore voted in favour of the report
Unless this situation is achieved , we will face many problems and issues that will inevitably be worse for the most remote economies
And all of us who voted for the report - as I did too - are P@@ ec@@ os B@@ ills and Cal@@ am@@ ity Jan@@ es
HIV/AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis require a global and coherent response , which will cost considerably more than the financial and human resources available to most developing countries
I voted for this excellent report but deeply regret the lack of final agreement on the budget allocation
These diseases are major killers but they need not be
Three things are needed to change the situation , as the report makes clear
The EU must ensure that its agricultural subsidies and trade practices do not undermine local food production
Secondly , investment in the necessary infrastructure to deliver healthcare
We need to increase our funding to ensure that people can survive these diseases
The devastation caused by HIV/AIDS is well-known but TB is increasing and malaria remains endemic
The necessary measure to combat these diseases would lead to an overall lifting of the quality of life for some of the world 's poorest people
I support the rapporteur and his efforts to increase new funding
We now know that these diseases are continuing to spread and are creating huge numbers of victims
In Sub@@ -@@ Saharan Africa the average life expectancy has dropped to 47 years , mainly because many young people are dying and children are having to grow up without parents
This is a significant step forward
As the rapporteur highlights , trade policies cannot brutally ignore the challenges of diseases that are a priority at world level
In fact , their impact prevents development policies from being effective
These diseases can be eradicated through access to essential drugs
There is therefore the issue of the cost , but also of promoting new drugs
I welcome Mr Wijkman 's report and his proposal for a regulation
Equally important is removing barriers , such as licences and patents , to access by developing countries to pharmaceutical products and international partnerships for developing new generations of products
It should , once again , be pointed out that 70 % of people infected with AIDS live in sub-Saharan Africa
The three epidemics referred to in the report affect mainly the poorest populations
This would strengthen infrastructures and health systems and link the field of reproductive health with the ongoing concern for maximum complementarity
For all these reasons , I felt bound to vote for this report
I must , nevertheless , make some specific comments
In fact the opposite is true
This is necessary given the frequent allegations of maladministration , which are particularly shocking in an area in which human health and life are at stake
One of the main tasks of the European Union is to ensure access for all to fundamental rights
Access to the health system is a right recognised for all citizens of the Union by Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
A strong correlation has been established between poverty and the spread of disease
It is essential that the European Union should endeavour to prevent illnesses caused by poverty
These prevention efforts must go hand in hand with treatment and people who are infected need to be supported
It is important to allocate more resources , and the Commission needs to have sufficient trained staff
We also hope to step up research into these diseases in order to find treatments and vaccinations
We should remember that the European Parliament asked in October 2001 for 10 % of the Community development cooperation budget to be allocated to health
Mr President , we have just heard the latest act of that great opera ' Co@@ s@@ ì f@@ a Fatuzzo '
Our colleagues in the Scottish Parliament have also done so
Those at West@@ min@@ ster , shamefully , will be denied that opportunity even if a decision is made by Tony Blair to commit their constituents to war in Iraq
My commitment to this Parliament 's resolution of this morning is unequivocal , above all as to its central point
There can be no lawful armed invention in Iraq without express United Nations authority
It is not enough for George W
Bush or Tony Blair to be satisfied that there has been a material breach of resolution 14@@ 41
Only if the Security Council so finds , and only if it resolves that action is to be taken , may action lawfully occur
I am glad to see that the article by the Prime Minister in today 's Times effectively confirms that
We look to the United Nations inspectors to oversee effective disarmament by Iraq or to establish its clear breach of the resolution
They will need time for that
If this is old Europe , then old Europe stands up for the rule of law and for the peaceful resolution of conflict wherever possible
These are the three characteristics
you represent an old Europe
It is a pity that we could not get a big majority in this House to send a clear signal on behalf of the whole Parliament
But I wanted to focus on the Middle East
We must not forget this while we are talking about the crisis in Iraq
We must not lose sight of it because otherwise we will never have peace in the long-term
Using this degree of firmness now would help to maintain peace in the future
By removing this sentence , the resolution adopted could imply that the Union is not really prepared to act if Saddam Hussein continues to prevaric@@ ate , which is disastrous
Iraq is no more dictatorial a country than its Arab neighbours
However , it is the only country being targeted , and without any particular reason in comparison with its neighbours
War is always a failure in which the first victims are always innocent people
Bush the right to throw the region into a state of unrest in the medium term
We should therefore say no to war and trust the UN
This is why I voted in favour of Parliament 's resolution against war , and regret that a large proportion of the right wing opposed it
But the resolution as a whole remains ambiguous
It passes back to the UN Security Council the possibility for further action , including military action , after a complete evaluation of the situation ?
This is why I abstained on this text
The mobilisation of public opinion should curb the mindset of war that is developing day by day
I therefore join in the call from the Porto Alegre social forum for an international demonstration day on 15 February
With or without the UN , we need to reject this war
Iraq is rich in petroleum
That is why there is much more interest in the problems in that country than in the injustices in other dictatorships
Saddam Hussein is a cruel dictator
The Kurds in the north and the Shi@@ ites in the south would have a better life if he stopped interfering with them
Nevertheless , these terrorised population groups never win the support of the outside world to enable then to separate from Iraq
America in particular , which used to be on friendly terms with this dictator , wants to keep Iraq together at any price
The USA is very keen to have a friendly regime that guarantees the continued supply of cheap oil
We must not bomb these people , who are already disadvantaged by sanctions , further into Saddam 's hands
More and more people in Europe and America are demonstrating under the slogan ' No blood for oil '
Unfortunately America cannot be restrained any longer , but Europe must make sure that it does not become an access@@ ory
The United Kingdom , Italy and Spain are threatening to go along with the creation of destruction and streams of refugees
My position on the Iraqi conflict is clearly expressed in the speech I gave in yesterday 's plenary sitting
An explanation of my vote is nevertheless needed , which I can only give through this statement
I have ultimately voted against this report because I am disappointed at the vote on successive amendments
The final vote , in fact , contains a perverse paradox
Many Members will have voted in favour because they believe that in doing so they are preserving world peace
Mr President , the Socialist Group supported the compromise resolution on North Korea
We believe it is an important issue and I concur with my colleague , Mrs De Key@@ ser , who spoke earlier
We are obviously critical and concerned about possession of the technology for uranium enrichment by North Korea
It could only make a delicate situation worse
Yet , there is little if any , attempt to impose sanctions against General Mushar@@ a@@ f in Pakistan , who is responsible for counter-@@ trading such sensitive technology for missiles
The situation on the Korean peninsula is potentially far more dangerous than in Iraq
Here the passage from peace to war would put millions of lives at risk
Much has been made of the DPRK 's secret acquisition of uranium enrichment technology in breach of the spirit , if not the letter , of the 1994 framework agreement
It is by no means ab@@ solved , but the faults are not entirely on one side
We welcome the proposed visit by Solana , Patten and the Presidency
This time we hope it will involve Parliament
Last time round , we were told it was a small delegation - it turned out they took 75 journalists
When we pointed this out to the Commission , they said next time around they would consider involving Parliamentarians
Finally , I would like to draw attention to paragraph 8
This offers a way forward for the future
This resolution is a ' travel warrant ' for true democracies
A condemnation of the plundering carried out by the Mo@@ bu@@ to regime
After bloody wars with more than two million casualties in the N@@ DRC and hundreds of thousands in Rwanda and Burundi , the fighting continues
That is because , with all this talk about war that we are obliged to wage , Africa remains forgotten
It is this anarchy in the plundering that bothers the rapporteur
He prefers legal plundering
They are the states that establish or support local dictators , who supply arms , who subsidise looting companies
Faced with so much hypocrisy and cynicism , we prefer to abstain
there is too much fraud , too much deceit against Europe
I closed my eyes for a moment and saw the Be@@ ag@@ le Bo@@ ys walking along the European Parliament 's corridors , and then I had a brain@@ wave
I knew how to explain why I voted for the report and , above all , that I should make a suggestion
This is perhaps the only way to combat the fraud against Europe 's budget
As is so often the case in this House , the resolution is highlighting situations that are unbearable for people
Yes the hunger in the world is an intolerable scandal
However , as usual , the report does not propose any real solution
Even worse , it is only acknowledging the tragedy in order to advocate greater market freedom
What the report calls fair international trade does not exist
It is a hollow term , which is seeking to make us believe that in that we can drastically reduce poverty
We obviously do not associate ourselves with such a verbal masquer@@ ade on such a dramatic subject
The resolution highlights the tragic situation of over 30@@ 7 million people who are currently living on less than 1 dollar per day
So 900 people are dying of hunger every day in the world
The resolution considers that the LDCs have not been capable of making the structural economic reforms that are essential in order for them to cease to be in that category
This is a clear contradiction
The resolution repeatedly ext@@ ols the virtues of the IMF and World Bank methods and of the laws of the market for bringing LDCs out of poverty
That is actually where we should be looking to find the underlying causes of poverty in those countries
That concludes the explanations of vote
I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament
( The sitting was closed at 12
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 30 January 2003
Last Saturday , Mr Jose@@ ba P@@ ag@@ az@@ a@@ ur@@ t@@ und@@ u@@ a , head of the municipal police in a village in the Basque country in Spain , was shot dead by a terrorist
On my own behalf and on behalf of this House , I have already conveyed our deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to his family
Mr P@@ ag@@ az@@ a@@ ur@@ t@@ und@@ u@@ a was an active member of the Socialist Party
He was also an active member of the Basque citizen 's initiative , ¡ Basta Ya
won the Sakharov Prize in 2000 and Mr P@@ ag@@ az@@ a@@ ur@@ t@@ und@@ u@@ a came to our Parliament to attend the Sakharov prize-@@ giving ceremony at that time
By murdering him the terrorists have shown once more their denial of the right to life and their contempt for the right to freedom of political expression
I ask you , please , to observe one minute 's silence
The Minutes of the sitting of Thursday , 30 January 2003 have been distributed
May I ask for the Rules of Procedure to be applied in this case ?
To the best of my knowledge a moderate degree of flexibility is shown
It is , however , a matter of concern that the Rules of Procedure be strictly applied
If , as a result , an amendment needs to be made to that effect , let us do that
Subject to that observation , the Minutes are approved
If this request is accepted the debate on Iraq could be included on Wednesday from 3 p
The other debates that afternoon would continue from 5 p
and Council Question Time would therefore be cancelled
This is our objective and we believe it is important that Parliament can hold a debate so that you can speak for us at the summit next Monday
We are becoming accustomed to important matters - it is always important matters - ever more frequently reducing or doing away with the time available for questions
I ask you to put a stop to this practice
Questions to the Council used to be held at 9 p
I ask you to take a long-term approach to this problem , and to sort it out
Mr Posselt , your observation was more a point of order regarding Question Time
I specifically asked the House to take account of the fact that if we add the debate as requested , it would have the knock-on effect you mention
We now come to the one-@@ minute speeches on matters of political importance
Mr President , on a point of order , I wrote to you with regard to the Sand@@ ba@@ ek report and a possible referral back
However , within the last hour there have been developments and I have no need to raise the issue here
That sets a great example for the one-@@ minute speeches to follow
His local Member of Parliament - a senior cabinet minister - led the protests
This signals to the world a curious sort of respect by the American justice system for the rule of law and human rights
Let us at least ensure that such injustices do not go unnoticed
Mr President , you promised to investigate the matter of the dress code that an Italian MEP attempted to introduce during a hearing in Brussels
Mr Blak , it is too soon on a Monday for me to rise to such a challenge
The statement , signed by 3@@ 20 Members , demanded that , in future , the President of the Commission be elected by this House and no longer by the Council
The breakthrough was achieved by the 3@@ 13@@ th and 3@@ 14@@ th signatures , those of Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Poettering , whom I congratulate on their last-minute courage
It is my belief that it will strengthen our delegation to the Convention and help get it to accept this demand
I wish to request that you forward this position - now an official one taken by Parliament - to Mr Giscard d' Estaing
We can do that , Mr Leinen
Mr President , I know Mr Leinen to be an u@@ pri@@ ght and honourable colleague
So I will take this opportunity to reiterate what I told Mr Leinen when he was guiding my hand to where I should sign
I told him , ' If I sign , I do so not as Chairman of my group , but in my own name , modest person that I am
It poses a huge threat to international peace and the system of international law , and creates a precedent for other arbitrary acts of aggression
' we must stop the aggressive war on Iraq
We must warn against attempts by the big powers to blackmail the United Nations
We must oppose any form of European support for the war or participation in it
We demand that our countries do not provide the United States with military or other facilities to carry out its aggressive aims '
The question is , what will the European Parliament do to avert a war , in conformity with the wish of the overwhelming majority of the people of Europe ?
What will the European Parliament do to ensure that no Member State provides any assistance to the United States if they follow the path of war ?
I will submit a copy of the full text of the joint statement to the Secretariat
It is clear that a peaceful outcome to the current crisis is still possible
There are therefore grave responsibilities on us all to persuade the Iraqi authorities to give this full and active co-operation
Mr President , I would like to raise a very serious issue , to talk about a very serious situation , that of Cambodia
I think that Parliament should intervene , however , rather because what is at stake here is democracy , the consolidation of democracy in Cambodia
I have also asked the chairman of the delegation for relations with the Member States of ASEAN , Mr Nassauer , to invite the Cambodian ambassador to Strasbourg this week
I believe we should support this country if we want to avoid the risk of a counter-@@ revolution
The conflict is taking place between the Ug@@ and@@ an army and the revolutionary movement , the Lord 's Resistance Army , which daily abduc@@ ts a large number of children
Approximately 800 000 internally displaced persons are living in wretched conditions in refugee camps
A growing number of atrocities committed by the army against the civilian population is also reported every day
I should like to call upon you to contact the Presidency with a view to the implementation of an EU initiative that might help solve this conflict
Mr President , I am taking the floor because I should like to warn you that your good name is being misused in the Danish media
Now , we both know , because we were present at the relevant Conference of Presidents and both participated in the video conference , that that is not the case
I think you should have an opportunity to say so , because anyone reading the Danish newspapers would believe otherwise
Your name is , then , being used in that connection , and this is something I think you should perhaps do something about
The authorities of the State of T@@ ex@@ as reacted in an even more di@@ abo@@ lical way , stating that the Court of Justice could not stand in the way of the executions
Let me , in addition , take this opportunity to endorse what Mr Dupuis has just said with regard to the situation in Cambodia
The democratic opposition leader S@@ am R@@ ain@@ sy has now gone into hiding , accused of plo@@ tting to bring down the government
There is of course not a sh@@ red of truth in this , and I think that we should do something about this as well
Mr President , on a point of order , I would like to extend my sympathy to the family of Jose@@ ba P@@ ag@@ az@@ a@@ ur@@ t@@ und@@ u@@ a , whom I knew personally
Human damage cannot be repaired
It is impossible to evaluate human suffering
Could the last victim of the ongoing conflict in the Basque country become the final ca@@ th@@ ar@@ sis for its solution ?
The European Union 's own history provides recent examples of nations overcoming deep-rooted conflicts
We shall endeavour to set up a momentum of awareness
I support all those who are eager to work constructively together towards real peace for my homeland
Nevertheless , this goal cannot be met without the strong commitment of the international community
Our failure on this approach has meant a further descent into renewed clashes
I am sure that a virtuous circle in favour of political dialogue will bring reward and results
A change of gear in the European Union 's strategy is necessary and urgent
Mr President , we have just heard from the lips of Mr Gorostiaga a defence of murder as a method for resolving political conflicts
a colleague of Mr Gorostiaga , the Mayor of An@@ do@@ ain , has refused to condemn this murder before all his citizens
I do not therefore accept this kind of argument
Mr President , there are times when cynicism can reach such a degree of moral degradation that it is truly amazing
We were accompanied by many members of the media , who surely were not also being du@@ ped and manipulated
I fully agree with Mr Barón Crespo that murder is no solution to political conflict
That is why many of us went to Iraq
We believe that murder is no solution to political conflict and that we must do everything we can to ensure a political settlement
It is very disturbing to hear you , as President of this Parliament , criticise us in the media and question our credibility
You did not hear me , Mrs McKenna , but you may have read something in one Irish newspaper
Today I would like to sound a contrary note and welcome something that has happened recently in Mozambique
A journalist , Carlos Car@@ do@@ so , was murdered there for having blown the whistle on a corrupt group of individuals close to power
It was thought that the legal system would not be able to bring his murderers to justice
The legal system did work , however , and his murderers were convicted , with stiff sentences
This means that Mozambique , where until recently a war devastated an entire country and threw an entire people into poverty , now has democracy and the rule of law
Consequently the Mozambic@@ an authorities and legal system must be supported and encouraged
Now , Mr President , I wish to mention something that has happened here
Mr President , I would like to draw your attention to something regarding which the Member States here in the European Parliament do not enjoy equal status
Parliament 's Vis@@ itors Service is its calling card for the public
Each Member State should have its own permanent official working in the service , who speaks the language of that Member State and can explain to visitors how Parliament works
Parliament has now taken the decision not to have a permanent official who speaks Finnish
Finnish will be the only language not used by any permanent official to give explanations to groups of visitors regarding the work of Parliament
This , I believe , is discrimination against one Member State and one language
I hope you will be able to do something about this situation and that the Finnish language will enjoy equal status with the other languages
Let me check the details and I will get back to you with the results of my enquiries
The people of Europe recognise that they are protesting not against America , but against President Bush and against war
It is very important that this day should not go by without our acknowledging this initiative
Respect for the right of the Iraqi people to determine their own future
No more using the UN to legalise force
This crime can be avoided
The problem is whether the European Parliament will abandon its indulgent , Pon@@ tius Pil@@ ate approach and come out clearly against this criminal war
M@@ ak@@ h@@ m@@ our is a refugee camp for Turkish Kurds , of whom there are around 10 000
That is why they want to go home , to their Turkish mountains
These people want to go home , and they will be the first victims if they are unable to do so
That is why I think this request is fully justified
I would ask you please to supply the full details on that matter to my office
Mr President , I had not intended to ask to speak today
Political freedom involves allowing the expression of opinions that we find disagreeable
Today , I hear speakers who are unwilling to hear a Member of this House say what his electors expect of him
It is only on that basis that Parliament is able to function
Mr President , on a point of order , two Members have raised the question of comments attributed to you in both Irish and Danish newspapers
You said that those comments were not correct
You advised us to contact the sub-@@ ed@@ itor of the Irish newspaper concerned
Therefore , Mr President , could you contact the editors concerned in the Independent New@@ sp@@ aper Group and ask them to carry a correction of the remarks you made ?
What they put in as a quotation was correct
What else they carried , by way of opinion , was not mine
I am not prepared to deal with the matter in those terms
No , it is not a point for plenary
I am not responsible for issues that are not quoted
( ' It is your responsibility
I will not accept responsibility for what is not a quotation of my own
That is the end of the matter as far as I am concerned
You can pursue the matter if you please , but I will not waste my time on it
I apologise once again to colleagues who were on the list to speak , but we have overrun the time allocated
That concludes the item
On behalf of Parliament I welcome to our official gallery the Committee on Energy Policy of the Danish Parliament , the Fol@@ keting , and its president , Mrs Mad@@ sen
I hope that your meetings and your time with us in Strasbourg will be productive
Thank you for coming
The next item is the Commission statement on the World Economic Forum
Much has been made of two opposing views of globalisation , which supposedly characterise these two fora
These two events , however , have many things in common
First of all , they were both created as places of thought and places of influence
They were also both created gradually in order to influence global economic and political development
Lastly , they are also both products of the globalisation that they feed , even though their views of what globalisation is and should be differ
Furthermore , these differences do not just exist between these two fora , but also within each one
It is also interesting to note that the main themes of each of these events also have something in common
At Davos , the first theme discussed was ' security and geo@@ politics '
I would add that , this year , some people were even warmly welcomed in both fora
I am thinking in particular of the new President of Brazil , Mr Lul@@ a da Silva
As political leaders , we cannot fail to take seriously an expression of public opinion on this scale
the citizens are telling us that they do not want to suffer globalisation
They want globalisation to be a project that integrates rather than divides the whole planet
What is this globalisation of which we have spoken so much again this year at Porto Alegre and at Davos ?
I do not believe that there is a plot behind globalisation
The instability and injustice that were condemned both at Davos and Porto Alegre are one of the consequences of the effectiveness of this market capitalism
In this regard , our point of view in the Commission is clear
We must accept market globalisation , because it releases tremendous development potential
However , we must provide a global regulatory framework for it in order to ensure that this development will be fairer and more sustainable than it is at present
In a way , this global regulation is the synthesis that we are trying to achieve of Porto Alegre and Davos
This synthesis is difficult and painful
It is taking a while to establish for at least two reasons
We know that , within Parliament itself , the discussions on this subject are sometimes heated
It is therefore easy to understand that addressing these subjects in order to find an international agreement is naturally going to be a long-term project
We must therefore ensure that the multilateral system is developed , reinforced , and built more solidly , so that it allows countries to adapt differently to market capitalism
I feel that this is the message that has reached us here in Europe this year , from both Porto Alegre and Davos
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the World Economic Forum met in Switzerland and the World Social Forum in Brazil
I wonder why they met in parallel , and thousands of kilometres apart , rather than together
This combined approach is in line with the ecologically responsible market economy , which is our model for the political order
We are in favour of the market , but the market has its limits when it comes to the areas of social responsibility and environmental sustainability
In his closing address , Kofi Annan , the Secretary-General of the UN , called for a war on poverty
We share the belief that globalisation must go hand in hand with great efforts at fighting poverty
State borders , time zones , distance and size divide us less and less as time goes on
We bear ever greater responsibility for each other in global terms
When others are stricken , we are affected
Globalisation is happening , and what matters is that we make good use of the opportunities with which it presents us and minimise its risks , across both hemisp@@ heres
This is where we need Europe to have more clout on the world stage
We need a world economic and social order that is fairer and more just
Issues relating to the global social and economic order are matters of European domestic policy in the same way as European policy is part of national domestic policy
We need Europe to be stronger and more determined
Our continent has an answer to worldwide globalisation - that answer is Europe
We have to do our homework for ourselves
On our continent too , a place must be found for our common objectives in all government programmes and work programmes
We call on the Council to require every single Member State to undertake budgetary and economic reform along the lines recommended by the ECOFIN Council
Lisbon and the Internal Market are the tools we need in order to respond to globalisation and to discharge our obligations to the world at large
The events of recent months are not exactly cause for optimism in this regard
Nevertheless , we are seeing a growing and increasingly visible conflict over the form effective prevention policies may take
Europe has a vital interest in this issue
It must exert a world influence and be fully aware of its global responsibilities
Its original raison d' être was peace , following the devastating wars of the twentieth century
Over the last fifty years , it has perhaps been the first effective supranational response to the challenges of globalisation
I would like to put forward a few points on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party
As I see it , this is another area where there is a major role for the private sector
This is not about the major international concerns always transferring production to the countries where wages are lowest in order to reduce their production costs
This is about their consciously seeking partnerships with local firms and organisations
Corpor@@ ate Social Responsibility is not only a splendid expression but also of fundamental importance
This must of course be exercised on a completely voluntary basis and from the bottom up
So I call on business too to be as socially responsible as possible when making investments
The ideal is that business at a national level should implement this in all its policy areas
A second point that I want to make has to do with the importance of education in combating poverty
Here , too , the private sector can do its bit
By deliberately using their own know-how to support local vocational training , this sector can give the people a better education
In the long term , this will also be of benefit to their own personnel policy
In all this , I do not , of course , want to play down the part played by the developing countries ' national governments and by the international community
Human rights must always be nurtured and promoted
These factors today represent new and more promising prospects , especially demonstrating a new attitude that represents a clear break with the status quo that has prevailed in recent times
Consequently , and as was made clear there , the United Nations must be given a new boost and a new profile
Porto Alegre was not , therefore , by any stretch of the imagination , merely a critical counter@@ point to Davos
In its three versions , it established itself as a fundamental pillar in the construction of a real alternative to the neo-liberal model that Davos broadly represented
This model is inextricably linked to the situations of social injustice , in@@ i@@ qu@@ ity , division and crisis that we are seeing today
Solutions to these crises were sought un@@ successfully in Davos , because there was no consideration and even less analysis of the underlying causes of this crisis
Attention was focused on economic growth , but the importance of the fair distribution of wealth that this growth should provide was overlooked
It therefore comes as no surprise that President Lul@@ a da Silva 's speech in Davos should have caused such ri@@ p@@ ples
As a matter of fact , in this context , I would say that the European Union can and must contribute to ensuring that it does
Mr President , this was the last time the Porto Alegre Social Forum and the World Economic Forum will take place on the same day
The challenge , however , which we feel to be particularly important for our institution and the European Union is the Canc@@ ún conference and reform of the international financial institutions
Europe can make a difference
There is no need to shy away from this
For instance , Commissioner , please do not back@@ track on the agreements you committed to at Doha on medicines and TRIPS
Mr President , Commissioner , I will not repeat what I have said before on the subject of globalisation and the so-called neo@@ liber@@ alist model
I will endeavour to go straight to the point
We must fight on the front of protectionism , starting with the slogans , with the many things which have been said even in this debate
open up your markets ?
Open up your markets ? trade means work
If we cannot market our products we will have more unemployed men and women
These were the words of the Peruvian President , Mr Toledo , to us a month and a half or two months ago in a formal sitting in this Chamber
We must be bolder
We must not continue to let the United States carry off the prizes for genuine liberalisation of the agricultural markets
This is a practical political decision that we have to make , in the knowledge that there is a price for going against protectionism
there will be opposition from the textiles lobby , the farmers lobby
Do we have the courage to do it or not ?
This debate has gone on for no more than approximately ten years
I am@@ used myself the other day by looking up the word ' globalisation ' in a dic@@ tionary from the beginning of the 1990s
It was not even to be found , so this is a relatively new debate
Nonetheless , we can see how it goes in different phases
It is hardly a case of being in favour of , or against , a market economy
Rather , it is a question of which rules and which frameworks are to apply in the market economy that has now largely spread throughout the world
Quite obviously , there are a number of deficiencies and problems at present
Allow me to address a couple of issues
It is hard to see how many of today 's poorest countries are to be able to hold their own in the ever@@ more knowledge@@ -@@ oriented economy that is being developed
Trade is important , of course
I agree that we can do a lot to make things easier for the poorest countries , especially in the areas of agriculture and textiles
F@@ actors as far back in the process as research and research institutions have a role to play in training and the development of trade and industry etc
I believe we must adopt a quite different and much more generous approach to this area when it comes to issues of capacity
A second issue is the whole set of problems in connection with the environment
The solution is not , of course , to hold back development in the poor countries
Rather , it must be to develop completely new technologies
Commissioner , I am afraid that we are doing much too little to try to help promote technological advance in the poor countries
This is an area in which we could do very much more
These are just a couple of proposals for giving some focus to this debate on globalisation and its framework , rules and basic conditions
Mr President , Commissioner , some of us did , in fact , go to Porto Alegre
From that point of view , Porto Alegre III is no longer simply the anti-@@ Davos demonstration that Porto Alegre I was
This is therefore a highly legitimate protest even in terms of the principles and values of the European Union
Above all , it is an attempt to impose globalised solidarity , or responsible globalisation
It therefore represents hope
We still need to be equal to the questions raised by this movement in relation to the European Union
I shall cite three examples
Firstly , Europe often prides itself on providing the most public aid for development
That is true but , at the same time , our agricultural subsidies are ruining agriculture in the southern countries and , in particular , small farmers
What are we going to do to change this , to promote food security and self-sufficiency ?
Secondly , the arrival of Mr Lul@@ a da Silva in power in Brazil has inspired great hope but the IMF is imposing on him an annual budgetary excess of 3
What are we going to do to loo@@ sen the IMF 's vice-@@ like grip on Mr Lul@@ a ?
We are part of the IMF
Furthermore , we have more votes there than the US
Thirdly , as regards public services , there is much protest against the privatisation imposed by the IMF in the developing countries
The Economic Forum and the World Social Forum met con@@ currently , reflecting the split between the out@@ looks they represent
Yet , in my view , opinions do not have to be so sharply divided
It is unfair simply to equate globalisation with an unbridled cross-border capitalism that is to the advantage only of multinationals
Those who were called anti-@@ glob@@ alists have themselves understood this , and now call themselves alternative glob@@ alists
I think that general free trade still always offers the best guarantee of economic growth in all parts of the world , even in the poorest
The European Union is the best example of this
It is this unique model of true globalisation that we have to take out into the wider world
There is certainly no way back
As the European Union , we have an important part to play in this debate
In Davos , it was discussed because of the effects of the economic situation of the war against Iraq that the United States and its allies have decided on
The United States even want to destroy the idea of a constitutional political Europe with an independent role in the world
The other issue I wish to raise , Mr President , concerns international maritime traffic , the safety of our seas and of our coastal communities
The World Parliamentary Forum presented this problem as one of the main concerns of the ' old world ' school of thought
The European Union must attach priority to resolving this problem , which today particularly affects Galicia and other European countries , from the Spanish State to France
The sea represents life itself
We cannot allow it to be owned and contaminated by a greedy , irresponsible and corrupt form of capitalism that enjoys the complicity of some European States
I therefore hope that the European States and this Parliament take the decisions that are needed to prevent the destruction of the sea that gives us life and sustains us
Mr President , Commissioner , where is the truth to be found ?
Davos without Porto Alegre makes no sense and the same applies to Porto Alegre without Davos
The two complement one another and need to work on reconciling their approaches
This reconciliation is now to be found in Rio de Janeiro , in Johannesburg , in Lisbon and in Gothenburg
The challenge is to regulate globalisation , taking sustainable development as the model to pursue
Secondly , we must embark on ' greening ' the world economy
Today , producing ' green ' is not sufficiently competitive and consuming ' green ' is still a luxury
We must take action on prices by adding on the environmental costs of all products
A new institutional blueprint is crucial if we are to be able to put the tools provided by globalisation at the service of sustainable development
In Porto Alegre , I have taken part for the two last years as a Member of the European Parliament
Even when they are defending interests , people also have a conscience and this is what drives the world forwards , even in these current troubled times
Mr President , Commissioner , I am delighted to see that you give equal status to Porto Alegre and Davos
Market capitalism cannot continue to be the dominant form of politics
I would remind you - even if this is perhaps a s@@ oph@@ ism - that democracy and politics normally take precedence over economic considerations
Lastly , these same multinationals want at all costs to re@@ appropriate sustainable development and the common goods belonging to all mankind such as water , air and energy
It seems to me , however , that in Can@@ cu@@ n , Commissioner , you should help us to defend our idea of globalisation
Mr President , Davos and Porto Alegre are in different continents , but in them global problems were dealt with along the same lines
Business resources and entrepreneurship combined with the know-how , skills and legitimacy of the rest of civil society can provide lasting solutions to the problems of globalisation
The average cow in the OECD countries receives two euros every day in state aid , while more than two billion people live on less than two euros a day
More than a billion people have to get by on less than one euro a day
That is such a small sum of money that it does not even meet the basic requirements of international human and fundamental rights
These rights are what the economy is built on
they are a necessary prerequisite for companies ' viability and stability
In Russia , for example , conditions for business cannot improve significantly without some fundamental adjustments being made in the implementation of human rights and in the law
At present in Russia it is possible to solve problems informally with reference to arbitrary , un@@ written and ever-@@ changing laws , which only adds to corruption
It is therefore in the interest of companies too to be involved in the implementation of human and fundamental rights
One way is participation in the UN Global Com@@ pact
Furthermore , in the EU a framework for the social responsibility of companies has been promoted , but alongside voluntary action we need binding legislation
In addition , we should develop suitable sanctions to impose on companies which are guilty of , or have contributed to , human rights violations and corruption outside the EU
Businesses ultimately have enormous influence whatever the community , region or state they are located in
Davos , where the elite were to meet , against Porto Alegre , where popular opinion would meet
The theory is now beli@@ ed by the facts
In the face of environmental deterioration , the NGOs that take part in the forum propose the internationalisation of environmental protection and universal sustainable development
In the face of unilateralism and the return to the policy of pre-emptive war , the World Social Forum proposes global political and social mobilisation in favour of peace
These are the specific proposals arising from the Porto Alegre Social Forum , where only popular opinion meets , Commissioner
how will we in the European Union , in the Commission , receive these proposals ?
Could we imagine , more broadly speaking , that these hopes might be included in our European political agenda for another kind of globalisation , our kind of globalisation ?
It outlined a range of constructive proposals for world policies on the environment , peace and freedom of expression and combating hunger and disease
It is particularly important that the European Parliament should take into consideration what was said at the Forum regarding the forthcoming World Trade Organisation meeting in Canc@@ ún
Any subjec@@ tion of such services to market rules would be a breach of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Nice Charter and other formal international treaties
From this particular perspective , it is no coincidence that the Porto Alegre Forum was held in Brazil and that President Lul@@ a da Silva has now intervened
Mr President , Commissioner , I have been in Porto Alegre , the civil alternative to Davos , which was discussed earlier
In other words , the distance between the citizens and the people with real power is only increasing
it is considered that commerce is an important factor in development but there is no reference to reciprocity in the opening up of markets
The protectionism of the rich countries , including the European Union 's agricultural policy , has a negative impact on development
I believe , Commissioner , that Europe must be a model for reducing the distance between each position
The economic order promoted in Davos must be accompanied by a social and political order such as that called for in Porto Alegre
The participation of European parliamentarians in Porto Alegre is a good symptom , but the European Union 's partnership with citizens ' movements must go further
We urge the Community 's institutions to join in with global campaigns on access to water , agriculture , food safety and public services
We also ask the Commission to support the creation of a world fund to combat hunger and poverty
Could this social market economy with which you all , with very few exceptions , credit Europe , be a project for the world ?
I believe that the response could be affirmative
This could be our response , with a certain number of conditions
Then , clearly , the third condition is to succeed in providing our planet with the system of governance it needs
Undoubtedly that system will have to be more comprehensive than the measure available to us today , which is both partial and unbalanced
On this point , I agree with what both Mr Miranda and Mr Moreira Da Silva said
In any case , that is what I think I understood on hearing Mrs Frassoni 's statements and , on this point , the Commission agrees
However , that is a discussion that I will also have to have with Mrs Auroi and a number of others
I shall now speak on a number of more specific points
I agree with Mrs Sanders-ten Holte and Mrs Korhola about the importance of companies ' social responsibility
This is proven , in particular , by fair trade and by consumer movements in favour of labelling that is environmentally friendly or promotes better social conditions for production
We are quite aware that , in these areas , nothing will be done without mobilising society itself
We would refer you to the Convention , which once again must rule on this point
Let us hope that , on this point as on others , the Convention will be more productive than the last intergovernmental conference
I shall not dwell on agricultural issues
We will come back to them in the debate that is to follow
As regards the service industry , the Commission 's proposals are now on the table
Your Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy may take them up under the conditions of our institutional agreement
These same proposals are also on the table of the Council of Ministers
Thus , the time for public debate has begun , and I personally am delighted
To end this debate , I have received six motions for resolutions presented in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure
The next item is the Commission Statement on the ' Au@@ thor@@ isation of generic medicines at WTO level '
Commissioner Lamy has the floor once again
The European Union has put a great deal of effort into searching for a solution
We do not feel that either of these two methods fulfils these two conditions of soundness and sustainability
We therefore cannot accept the current situation which is either failure or half-@@ measures such as the moratorium , even though this half-@@ measure provides a temporary solution
The Union 's position remains the same
That is why we have fully accepted the draft agreement of 16 December that was on the table
The problem of scope as regards the various types of health problem still remains
We know that only the Americans have been unable to join the consensus on this point
This situation , I have said this publicly and I repeat it to you now , is deeply regrettable , and this obstacle must be overcome
It is clear to the Union that the Doha mandate is intentionally broad and that we must respect this
We did so on the basis of a list which I would like to specify is neither exclusive nor restrictive
We feel that the use of the system should not be limited to the diseases on this list
There must be no misunderstanding on this point
This possibility of requesting an opinion should allow the United States to overcome their reticence with regard to the use of the system by developing countries
This would simply be a non-@@ restrictive opinion
There again , I would specify that this would in no way constitute an attack on the sovereignty of the Member States in the field of public health
We all know that the role of the WHO is , at least currently , purely advisory
Our objective , in placing this proposal on the table at the beginning of January , has been achieved
Discussions have begun again
We must make progress
Too many countries need to import low-cost medicines
Mr President , thank you , Commissioner Lamy , for your introduction to this important and complicated subject
We had been working on this issue for almost a year
The reason for this is , of course , that a great many pharmaceutical companies see no real profitability in this type of research
That is why we must seek innovative solutions
The market alone will not manage successfully to solve this problem
What , instead , is required is cooperation between the public aid organisations and industry
I am naturally aware of the negotiations in which the Commissioner has been involved
I can only regret that nothing has been achieved in the way of results
This is an incredibly important issue
The countries most dependent upon these exemption rules in the TRIPS Agreement are now in a position in which they are being discriminated against
The compromise that Commissioner Lamy is now trying to bring about contains a list
I think this list appears to be fine , but ideally , of course , there would be no need for any list at all
If we are now nonetheless to be heading towards a compromise , I think that what you have accomplished so far is commendable
I also think that the link with the WHO is an interesting idea
In conclusion , I want to say that it is incredibly unfortunate that we have ended up in this position
I find it incomprehensible that there is actually opposition on this issue
Mr President , this evening we will identify what are probably the two ma@@ ke-@@ or-@@ break issues for the next WTO round in Can@@ cu@@ n - TRIPS and public health and agriculture
Developing countries ' perception of our good faith , good will and sincerity towards them will be tested by our attitude to these two issues
The Council for TRIPS was asked to find an expedi@@ tious solution to this problem
Commissioner , we welcome the efforts you have made and the backing you have had to get this implemented
In an innovative and welcome suggestion you enlist the aid of the World Health Organisation
If the intention is not honoured , the new constraints would violate the spirit of the Doha Declaration and would show bad faith
I am sure you are right - and we have had discussions about this - to reject a moratorium on disputes or , indeed , a derogation
Neither is an adequate solution
Indeed , the only possible explanation is its politicians paying undue attention to the financial interests of pharmaceutical companies who paid for their election
They have come up with only a unilateral solution and a narrow list
Two deadlines have been missed already , and there is a real risk of deadlock if the efforts which we have channelled through you come to nothing
Concerns which have been raised , for example on the diversion trade in generic medicines , are being tackled
Let us welcome your proposal of 7 January
It is a multilateral solution which en@@ lists a reputable and widely trusted agency , the World Health Organisation
As you said , the solution must be lasting , fair and legally viable
The conflict should be examined on the basis of the guideline that public health has primacy over patents
We cannot overestimate the importance of finding a solution to this issue
I wish you very good luck , Commissioner
Mr President , in this debate it is perhaps worth citing once again what the Doha Declaration actually says
It is worth bearing in mind those words and repeating them for the record , particularly for the consumption of US observers
I doubt they are listening right now , but perhaps we can send them a copy of the Minutes of this stimulating discussion later on
it directly contravenes the letter of the Doha Declaration
It represents a spectacular assertion of narrow and misguided commercial interests over the greater prize of a development round itself
I would now like to quote a press release from the European Federation of P@@ harmaceu@@ tical Industri@@ es and Associ@@ ations
In other words , that statistic alone suggests there is very little commercial risk for either the European pharmaceuticals industry , or the US industry itself
My group strongly supports the initiatives taken by Commissioner Lamy and the European Commission
Un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism with a reason is just about comprehensible
Un@@ il@@ ater@@ alism without any logic whatsoever is unforgivable
We are therefore talking about a duty in which we have a high degree of responsibility
Mr President , I am amazed and saddened that this matter should be back up for discussion
In November 2001 , the developing countries were rejoicing in the Doha Declaration , which authorised them to have recourse to compulsory licences for public health reasons
This problem in paragraph 6 should have been solved before the end of 2002
In the meantime , the American pharmaceutical laboratories , who are the main financial back@@ ers for the Bush campaign , have returned to the attack
The proposals made by the United States or the European Union , which are each more restrictive than the last , have resulted in failure
The objective of paragraph 6 must be to ensure that countries with no production capacity can genuinely use compulsory licences
Mr President , the crux of this issue is very simple
We can achieve this by reaching an agreement between all contracting parties at the level of the World Trade Organisation
The crux of the discussions is the relationship between intellectual property rights and public health issues
We all recall the much publicised court case brought by 40 pharmaceutical companies against the South African Government on this issue
We have a moral obligation to support the effort of finding the way to provide urgently needed medicines to people in developing countries
This is a matter for the World Trade Organisation , but progress , I regret , is far too slow
Last November , the European Union presented a compromise proposal to the WTO ministerial meeting in Australia to find a solution to this important matter
However , it now appears that the US Government is just not satisfied with the terms of this compromise
The US Government believes that too many diseases are included in the European Union 's proposal
Too many diseases are included they say , when in the meantime people are dying from AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis
Over three million people will die from AIDS this year alone
The technology is there to provide suitable treatment to sufferers of this disease
On a separate but related matter , I have called on the members of the international community many times to increase their budgets to combat the AIDS epidemic
In fact , debt relief programmes must be put in place for developing countries with high levels of AIDS sufferers
Mr President , Commissioner , this debate calls to mind concepts of peace and solidarity upon which the European Union was founded
As a rapporteur to Parliament on directives relating to medicines , I have worked on directives concerning the authorisation of the marketing of medicines within the European Union
I am therefore well aware of the issues involved
In certain circumstances , this issue can be resolved quite easily
Do we have the right to let people waste away ?
Do we have the right to allow people to die when they could be treated ?
This would amount to failing to help a person in danger
In accordance with the principle of equal access to medicines and therefore to health , I would urge the European Union to use all its influence to support these authorisations
At the same time , the Union should however ensure that a specific framework is created and that the process is completely transparent
I believe it would be helpful for the World Health Organisation to act as arbit@@ er in this , and would like to ad@@ duce three reasons for this
Firstly , effective measures should be implemented to prevent the parallel importation into the European Union of generic medicines destined for developing countries
If such controls are not introduced , the people we wish to help will not receive the medicines destined for them
Furthermore , such parallel imports would undermine the quality health system we wish to develop within the European Union
The relevant authority should draw up a permanent register of generic medicines destined for developing countries to ensure the effectiveness of such controls
I hope this list will evolve over time as new diseases appear , in order to increase the efficiency of product distribution and quality control frameworks
As for the quality of these medicines , we know that they are not third-@@ rate products
On the contrary , we know that they are just as effective as other medicines
Making such products available , however , could only be one aspect of curing disease and fighting the epidemics we are trying to curb
Lastly , Commissioner , the provision of local infrastructures , control laboratories and training for professionals is in fact just as important as making these products available
For all these reasons , I think the WHO should take on the essential role of guarantor for the process of making medicines available to all
Ultimately the deciding factor turned out to be developing countries ' access to cheap medicines without paying for patents , either by their own production or by importing them
Ultimately the political breakthrough came
That applies to all developing countries and all medicines
There are no restrictions , and no external prior approval is needed
The assignment was to round this off in a legally conclusive text
This should have been done in December 2002 , but it failed because the USA , in my opinion , was no longer adopting a multilateral position
I believe President Bush trampled all over the Doha agreement in favour of his own pharmaceutical industry
We should like to say that you enjoy our full support , but we do not wish to bow under pressure from the USA any further
We want no restrictions on countries , no restrictions on the types of medicines , nor any prior approval by an external authority
That is naturally a little different from the advice from the WHO
We do support stringent measures to protect our own European market against dumping , however
We urge other groups in this Parliament to vote accordingly
The interests of AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria patients worldwide must be at centre stage
N@@ ec@@ ess@@ ity knows no law
The TRIPS agreements must not be a limiting factor
As the PSE Group we are convinced that if this point fails , Doha will be ke@@ el@@ ha@@ uled and Can@@ cu@@ n will have failed before it even starts
Then there will be no development round
And that is the last thing that the world will permit in the current , very serious crisis
That is why we are taking this clear stance
The arrangements made in Doha are crucial for allowing people in developing countries better access to medicines , particularly those for diseases associated with poverty
I would , however , like to put forward one criticism , although I agree with all the things that have been said here
Access to medicines is not only a question of money
There are two other issues that I would like to raise
Firstly the infrastructure in the countries concerned , and in this case I am talking about distribution and about which people in those countries get access to these medicines
Dis@@ tribution means that there must be an infrastructure , something that is completely absent in many poor countries
this is not a priority for the regimes in the countries concerned
For example , a person taking AIDS medicines has to take them up to three times a day every day
This means that they have to stick rigidly to their treatment regime and that distribution channels are therefore needed to ensure that the patients concerned can always obtain their medicines
Then new medicines will have to be developed
That is my first point
My second point is that regimes are often , in fact , corrupt
What is more , they are sometimes re-@@ exported or simply exported to Western countries
Commissioner , Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel is painting a very negative picture of developing countries
Fortunately , things are progressing at this moment , although diseases are progressing even faster
It is precisely this race , against AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria , that we must try to win
It is therefore of the utmost importance that you succeed in your assignment , Commissioner
The failure of Doha does , however , make us pessimistic
Mr President , I will not bas@@ h America because the whole set of international trading regulations on medicines is in a mess
These include definitions of what constitutes a measure to protect public health and is , therefore , subject to the compulsory licensing requirements allowed under TRIPS
Initially , the communicable diseases of HIV-@@ AIDS , malaria and TB were included , but now there are plans to extend this list if the WHO thinks it appropriate
As these countries become more developed , more western diseases will become endemic , and a case will be made to extend the categories even further
Also , as more migrants come to Europe , diseases such as the three above will become more common
This will create markets for these drugs and lead to enormous market-driven pressures for parallel re-@@ importation by unscrupulous middlemen from LDCs , which produce them cheaply as generics
This will under@@ cut the profits of legitimate pharmaceutical industries
It also appears that the exemptions discriminate against smaller countries which lack the manufacturing base to produce the required life-saving drugs under compulsory licences
After all , many developing countries - even if the drugs were free - do not have the infrastructures to administer the treatments
At the very least , I call for a three-@@ yearly review in future to see how this TRIPS agreement works out in practice
The reality is that developing countries will not accept the United States ' insistence on restricting exports to those who treat only a handful of infectious diseases
I fear also that , even if the United States conce@@ des , the reforms will be wrapped up in red tape and have some TR@@ IP@@ S@@ -@@ plus features
We should now consider a fresh start that is likely to produce a workable solution , although I accept , regrettably , that this is unlikely
The danger is that this whole issue could drag on until Can@@ cu@@ n
If this were to happen , then the TRIPS issues could then again be used as a bargaining chip in the negotiations on agriculture , services and the new issues
Is that something you see as likely , Commissioner ?
Surely it would be disastrous if developing countries were expected to do trade-@@ offs in the only real area where they secured such a major victory at Doha
That was not the intention at Doha
Mr President , when the United States recently faced the threat of an anthrax attack , the authorities needed adequate and cheap supplies of medicine to treat the illness
They therefore took it upon themselves to oblige the pharmaceutical laboratory concerned to provide the medicines more cheaply
Had the laboratory refused to do this , the United States authorities would have resor@@ ted to a compulsory licence
The United States was not required to negotiate the conditions for the potential production of such a generic medicine
Why then are certain developing countries now being required to do so ?
I will now move on to my second point
I believe Mr Clegg was right to cite the Doha declaration
I think my fellow Members were right to remind us that an undertaking was implemented and that this undertaking should be respected
These countries should therefore be allowed to make their own decisions on this
Those with the capacity to produce medicines should be able to decide the circumstances in which they might need to resort to compulsory licences
Those without the capacity to produce medicines should be able to decide the circumstances in which they might need to resort to parallel imports
These imports would be legal , as they would be sanctioned by the state
I think we are now faced with the difficult task of finding a simple and effective solution to the problem
Any solution must not entail long and costly negotiations and procedures
The latter would eventually cost the lives of millions of sick people who would die without access to treatment
We heard that our fellow Member , Mr Tannock , is more concerned about the possible fall in the profits of certain industries than the fate of the sick
Mr Lamy , you are clearly under pressure from certain quarters , including the European industries
I urge you not to give way to these pressures
The people want us to help the sick in developing countries
The EU initiative covers the most comprehensive possible list of major infectious diseases but is not restrictive , which was the main problem with the negotiations in 2002
These are all horrendous diseases that have been virtually eradicated in the West , yet millions die unnecessarily in the Third World every year
The debilitating effect of these diseases affects families , communities and economies throughout the developing world
This EU initiative should help to improve the standard of living and public health in some , if not all , of the developing world
This gives the EU proposal some flexibility to respond to unforeseen outbreaks
The response will be based on World Health Organisation expertise in the field
The compromise proposal , which is more humane that the US approach , should allay US concerns that patent laws could be breached and weakened
At the same time , it provides sufficient flexibility to deal with specific disease-@@ related crises , should they occur
This debate will hopefully send a strong message of support for the Lamy proposal , as the WTO General Council simultaneously discusses the subject
It is important to help the developing world to eradicate these diseases without depriving the pharmaceutical industry of the funding it needs for further research in this area
This comes on the eve of another ministerial meeting at which specific political positions on the matter might be sealed
I am however concerned about the declaration of the Council for TRIPS
It means going back on the undertakings we gave at Doha
Access to generic medicines for developing countries is not just a commercial issue
It is at the heart of development the world over
If we do not make progress on this question , all our other efforts to promote development will be in vain
We would be wasting our time
Achiev@@ ed in difficult circumstances , the Doha declaration on public health of November 2001 was an important first step towards helping the populations of developing countries and promoting their interests
We looked forward to at last sending a message of hope to those people
This stance is not merely unfortunate
We should welcome the efforts of the Commission to reach an agreement on access to medicines
Nonetheless , the Commission is still failing to take enough account of the legitimate demands of poor countries
Negotiations with a view to reaching an agreement must recom@@ men@@ ce at the earliest opportunity
The lives of millions of people in developing countries are at stake
I am convinced agreement could be obtained on the basis of the Doha declaration and Article 30 of the AD@@ PIC agreement , and on that basis alone
An agreement achieved on any other basis , that did not take account of Article 30 , would extinguish the hopes of the people of developing countries
They want to lift themselves out of poverty and improve their worsening living conditions , conditions that are increasingly unacceptable
Such an agreement would also send a clear message to the people of Europe
It could be a fine example of the basis on which the European Union works and of the extent of our concern for others
Commissioner , we call on you to speak for our collective conscience
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that we have to start by clarifying whether patent laws are actually in place
The copyright must be valid in the country in which it is sol@@ d; that is to say , it must have been registered and granted there
We must ask ourselves , though , what happens if a compulsory licence is actually granted
Will it solve all our problems ?
Mr President , this is a difficult issue on which feelings can run high
I would first like to thank the representatives of all the groups who have expressed their support for the position I have adopted on behalf of the Commission
I have noted the statements made by Mr Wijkman , Mrs McNally , Mr Clegg , Mr Marset Campos and Mrs Maes in particular
The European Parliament is firmly united on this issue
This is very important for us at the Commission , it is important to me and it is important in the field of external relations
On that occasion we did not however settle the issue of countries which have to resort to imports
This implies that the system of compulsory licensing could be applied across international boundaries , giving rise to complicated legal problems
This problem is currently dealt with on a provisional basis
All developing countries can at present use a compulsory licensing system to obtain benefit from differentiated prices
This applies to medicines to treat diseases like AIDS , malaria , tuberculosis and certain other diseases
This is possible because of the provisional arrangement that the United States and the European Union implemented in December
This provisional arrangement is simply not enough however
We think it is unlikely to galvanise all the parties involved
These parties are the governments concerned , their health systems and the pharmaceutical industry
A long-term solution must therefore be found
None has so far emerged from the discussions taking place in Geneva , because of the American position
Further evidence of this was provided at the Council on TRIPS this morning
I would like to reassure Mrs Kinnock on one point
The issue of access to medicines is not on the Doha negotiating programme due to be concluded at the end of 2004
The issue falls beyond the scope of these negotiations and will therefore not be the subject of any kind of trade-@@ off
It stands alone as a subject in its own right and on the table of the World Trade Organisation
I am simply referring to this particular example because I have read about it in the press
I wonder why the pharmaceutical industry has adopted the position it has
The latter resulted in the United States rejecting the compromise on the table in December
I just cannot understand its attitude
Its stance will only strengthen opposition to the principle of intellectual property across a large number of sectors
This time the determination will be there
The United States would do well to consider an example of how to reach a consensus when circumstances make this imperative
They could study the attitude adopted by the European Union recently towards the K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly process on the subject of blood diamonds
This may be a less high profile case , but it is nonetheless important , especially for certain developing countries
We Europeans were isolated in the World Trade Organisation
We were the only party reluctant to ask the WTO for a dispens@@ ation to implement the K@@ im@@ ber@@ ly agreements
We stood alone and eventually decided to go along with the consensus because we did not want to stand in the way of this solution
We shall do so by coming up with our own interpretation of the articles of the WTO
The United States could perfectly well adopt the same approach on this issue
On the question of parallel imports raised by several Members , I am sure you will be aware that the Commission has put forward a proposal for the European Union
The Council is currently studying the proposal
Those of you with an interest in the matter could join me in urging the Council to take less time than usual to rule on the proposal
I would now like to move on to my last point
There are many other issues to address if we are to ensure better access to medicines for people in developing countries
The quality of the health systems must be improved
There needs to be a system of public research into diseases that no longer exist in developed countries and are therefore no longer of interest to the pharmaceutical industry
Problems of distribution and medical culture must be resolved
There will still be much to be done , even after the difficulties relating to patent law have been overcome , which I trust will be soon
The Commission will certainly persevere , spurred on by the statements made during this debate
Pursuant to Rule 37 I have received six motions for resolution to wind up the debate
The next item is the Commission statement on the WTO agricultural trade negotiations
Mr President , as Mrs McNally said during the previous debate , agriculture was one of the make or break issues at the Doha negotiations mentioned recently in another context
Mr Fischler and I will both attend the informal WTO mini-@@ ministerial meeting in Tokyo at the weekend , and agriculture is one of the issues on the agenda
We are pleased the Council of Ministers recently approved the Union 's negotiating position
It was unfortunate , however , that approval was only possible after heated debate and several delays
Nonetheless , the fact that Council has approved this position will strengthen our own hand considerably at the forthcoming discussions
Let me now say a few words on the main features of the modalities of agriculture negotiations , as they are known in negotiating jargon
These modalities will figure prominently between now and the end of March
Firstly , I should like to shed some light on the meaning of the term modalities
To give you an example , these rules may relate to subsidies
They can lay down which subsidies are permitted and which are not
Such rules may also relate to import procedures
As for the figures , they are intended mainly to achieve a reduction in tariffs and a reduction in subsidies
This is what is at issue in the current phase to be concluded by 31 March
Of course , there is more to agriculture negotiations than this
Nonetheless , it is a very important element of such negotiations
Consequently , Mr Franz Fischler and I have always made it our business to ensure the Union pul@@ ls its weight in negotiations on agriculture
The proposals we have put on the table bear witness to this
They demonstrate that the European Union is in a position to negotiate on agriculture further to the reform of its common agricultural policy
At the same time , however , the Union is determined to negotiate so as to ensure that development becomes the driving force behind bilateral negotiations
The proposals we placed on the table testify to our commitment , our mandate and our ambition
At Doha , we committed ourselves to negotiating on the whole agriculture chapter
This includes opening up of markets , the reduction of export subsidies and domestic support , mainstreaming non-trade concerns and making a strong commitment to development
Our mandate does not permit us to pre-empt aspects of the reform of the common agricultural policy on which no decision has yet been reached
We are bound to operate strictly within the framework of previous reforms and particularly the most recent of these , under Agenda 2000
It is worth emphasising lastly that we wish to be fully involved in these negotiations , particularly where the interests of the most vulnerable countries are at stake
We hope to play a leading role in the negotiations
Contrary to statements made from both ends of the spectrum , ours is actually a midd@@ le-@@ of-@@ the-@@ road position
It is in stark contrast to the positions of extremists of both sorts
We trust our position will enable us to facilitate agreement on all aspects of the agricultural negotiations
I would now like to share with you some of the details of the content of the proposals
Firstly , with regard to access to the markets , we are proposing a 36 % overall reduction in customs duties , with a 15 % minimum reduction per line
This reduction is based on the method applied during the previous round
In our view , it is the only viable method given the time constraints we are up against
Our formula differs radically from the so-called ' Swiss ' formula put forward by several other countries in that it allows wider margins for developing countries
Clearly , this is vital to the negotiations in question
It is worth mentioning that the adjective ' Swiss ' is somewhat misleading , as Switzerland itself denies any responsibility for the formula attributed to it
We have proposed detailed and ambitious provisions for developing countries
These include zero rating for a minimum 50 % of exports of agricultural products from developing to developed countries
Another proposal is for duty and quo@@ ta@@ -free access for all products originating from less developed countries and destined to industrialised and emerging countries
This amounts to extending the scope of our ' everything but arms ' initiative
The issue of phased tariffs for products of particular interest to developing countries will be raised for the first time
Our approach to export subsidies is in the same vein
As a first step , we propose a 45 % average reduction of the budget envelopes for export refunds
Further , we are prepared to progressively do away with all export refunds for certain products
Allow me to emphasise that point again
We propose gradually to eliminate export refunds for products of particular interest to developing countries
It must be made quite clear that obviously , this twin proposal can only be implemented if the other parties involved also restrict comparable export subsidies
I am referring to certain types of export credits and to what could in some cases be termed the abuse of food aid
I also have in mind the activities of state enterprises based in countries that actually enjoy a more liberal reputation , activities amounting at times to unfair practice
The Commission 's stance on this issue is unequivocal
We are not prepared to be the only member of the WTO to make concessions on agriculture issues
The effort we are prepared to make must be matched by all other parties supporting exports
We trust also that all industrialised countries will play their part in opening up markets
In addition , we are proposing to retain the current arrangements for internal support , as far as the yellow , blue and green box system is concerned
It does not make sense to tam@@ per with a system that has proved sensible and is capable of responding to needs as they arise
Further , we wish to introduce some new provisions
There are a number of loopholes in the current system of ceilings for the boxes , and these are being exploited to the point of abuse by several countries
I have in mind in particular variable aid of the deficiency payments type and our request to delete the de minimis clause for developed countries
In our view , its scope has been too broad
Another of our proposals involves integrating the expectations of developing countries , especially the most vulnerable , hence our proposals on market access
Another significant proposal , for which we are indebted to various non-governmental organisations is the notion of a so-called food security box
This would involve putting in place a special safety net mechanism for the most sensitive products in specific developing countries
Lastly , I should like to comment on other issues to be negotiated , over and above those strictly related to trade
As you will appreciate therefore , these broader issues are high on the European agenda
In conclusion I would like to say , Mr President , that these proposals aim to allay the concerns of three main interested parties
As regards our trading partners , notably the developing countries , on this occasion we are proposing a quite different and special treatment of the latter
We hope the European agricultural sector will be reassured that we shall continue to fight for support to allow them to continue to provide the services it renders to society
We shall also strive to protect our quality products by defending our designations of origin
To summarise , our proposals on agriculture do reflect most of the concerns informing our approach throughout this round of negotiations
Evidence of this is the proposal for free access to the markets of the richest countries for the agricultural products of the poorer countries
Also , the compromise proposal intended to ensure that at least 50 % of rich countries ' agricultural and food imports come from the poorest countries
This is what gives us the moral authority to say that this WTO Round must be the development round
Amongst these are the ACP countries , under the Cotonou agreements , and the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean
We have come up with good and positive initiatives under ' everything but arms ' , and our proposal for negotiation consolidates these proposals
I therefore believe that we must call on other rich countries in the world , even more highly developed than we are , to follow the EU 's example
Mr President , I am pleased indeed that Commissioners Lamy and Fischler will be going to Tokyo for the mini-@@ ministerial with an approved position
I agree with you , Commissioner Lamy , that the agriculture negotiations will be very important in determining whether or not the meetings in Can@@ cu@@ n are a success
The European Union certainly has a world responsibility in terms of negotiations on agriculture
As Mr Cunha has just said , the volume of trade alone would make us significant
However , we do not have sole responsibility , and countries such as the United States should be reminded that they have a responsibility too
I am sure in your discussions with Bo@@ b Z@@ ur@@ li@@ k you will remind him of that
However , you said quite clearly that the European Union can and will negotiate , so let us look at what that means
Naturally we have the interest of European producers and consumers in higher food quality , rural development , environment protection and animal welfare
It is the principal source of income and employment in developing countries and a major tool in the fight against poverty and indeed in the improvement of food security
We have a certain margin of manoeuvre within which to do it
There is some feeling within the Socialist Group that the proposal is somewhat lacking in ambition
We want more insistence on the importance of the green@@ box and more attention to special and differential treatment
You will need to consider whether the current CAP reform goes far enough
The Socialist Group would probably think not
We will leave it to you to push the agenda forward as quickly as you can
Negotiations have only just begun , and we are sure that if the Commission - Europe - takes a certain step , other trade blocs will have to follow
For us the most important thing is that we have found that the European people do not fully support European agricultural policy at this moment
Clearly this must change , so we must change European agricultural policy
We are therefore generally in favour of greater liberalisation of trade in agricultural products
Something else enters into this , however
Elsewhere in the world , farmers have far fewer of these kinds of rules to contend with
What is more , farmers in various parts of Europe do not always enjoy a very good income
We must be able to reward farmers for their performance on a basis other than their production of agricultural products
The Commission must also emphatically underline our endorsement of a system of integrated agricultural production , with control from stable to table , so to speak
the overwhelming majority of my group supports this , and we must do something for the poorest developing countries
It is clear that this is necessary for institutional balance and the whole decision-making process
This is not a new practice , however , since there are precedents in the reform of the CAP of 1992 and in Agenda 2000
I say this because certain aspects , such as the reduction in internal support , involve the need to adopt very controversial aspects in the proposed regulations on intermediate reform
With regard to the more specific proposals , I believe that there are some quite positive aspects in relation to the least-developed countries
However , the assumption is made that greater liberalisation of trade will lead to greater economic development
And this is not always the case
I believe the proposal to create a food security box is interesting , since it would be very useful also for the European Union for strategic and food security reasons
And our dependency stands at 75 %
This seems to me to be an extraordinary oversight
There are good reasons for this
It is abundantly clear that trade does not fill stom@@ ach@@ s , and if anyone does get rich from it , it is seldom if ever both the parties concerned
It is therefore understandable that it is from these sources that highly sceptical questions are being asked about precisely what is to be negotiated at the WTO
If the WTO negotiations are to be successful , then these mechanisms have to be done away with
This will enable us to develop in solidarity with people in the developing world , as well as with rural farming in Europe
I have said on many occasions in this House that uncertainty about the future is having devastating consequences for farm families
As for the detail of the WTO proposal , what we see once again is a desire by the Commission to exceed the mandate given to it by Member States
The cuts proposed in export subsidies , import tariffs and domestic farm support are both excessive and unnecessary
They certainly go beyond any area of commitment entered into in the Uruguay or Doha R@@ ounds
Improved market access will intensify competition in the EU market
I call on the Commission to be particularly vigilant during the negotiations on the products more sensitive to this aggressive competition , in particular beef and butter
I want the Commission to ensure that only minimal tariff reductions will be applied to those sensitive sectors
It is impossible to debate the forthcoming agricultural negotiations at the WTO without putting the matter in the context of the Commission 's mid-term review last month
All six impact studies , which the Commission carried out , assumed there would be no change in the multilateral trading framework
However , this is clearly not the case
I ask where then are the price increases which have been forecast by all these studies to come from ?
Dec@@ ou@@ pling , taken together with the WTO proposals , will cause a reduction in EU production of beef and sheepmeat
The Commission already knows my view that this will have a disproportionate impact on Ireland
For example , the Commission study indicates a 3 % fall in EU beef production , but a 12 % fall in Irish beef production
Less than 10 % of the world 's agricultural production ends up in international trade
The overwhelming bulk is traded locally or nationally
For some of the world 's population , food is not something that can be taken for granted
We must keep a close eye on the interests of these population groups at the WTO discussions
A recent study has shown that complete liberalisation of trade only provides poor countries with a minimal increase in their income
Countries such as India and Nigeria are asking for the WTO agreements to be applied flexibly , and rightly so
They want to support and protect their agricultural sectors and the development of the countryside in order to offer their rural population some security of existence
These countries need subsidies in order to guarantee food security and to support small-scale agriculture
Export subsidies are destroying the world market
The Commission is , quite rightly , proposing to reduce these further
If other countries agree to this , the result may be an increase in prices on the world market
I would , however , like to point out to the Commission that this does not help everybody
As many as 43 countries in Africa are net importers of food
They will therefore be worse off if food prices on the world market increase
This is why , in addition to the anti-dumping measures , technical assistance for these countries is of great importance
The incomes of farmers in the European Union are under pressure
Trade liberalisation is primarily of importance to trade and the processing industry
If Europe wants to retain its family-run farms , it will have to take measures that conflict with the principles of free trade
It will also have to act more effectively than it is doing at the moment
A study by the OECD shows that only a quarter of every euro of support that goes to agriculture ends up with the farmer
Further liberalisation without sufficient protection for the European agricultural model will result in a reduction in the number of farmers
Fortunately , the Commission 's proposal to the WTO is putting the case for the multifunctional agricultural model
Because agriculture still does not operate like a bicycle factory , we need appropriate protection at our borders
This protection must be transparent
Food aid as a cap@@ ped form of dumping is reprehensible
The Commission rightly highlights this in its proposal , along with other forms of agricultural support such as export credits , export guarantees and state trading enterprises
Finally , the Commission 's proposal is lacking a significant policy instrument that has a positive effect on the market and prices - I am referring to production control
This instrument is working properly for sugar and dairy products
The only dis@@ cord@@ ant note sounded by this system is the dumping on the world market of surpluses caused by excessively high quotas
We should therefore not do away with the quota system , but quotas should be realistic
The quota for dairy products is 105 % of consumption
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like to make three points concerning these agriculture negotiations under the auspices on the WTO
I must make it clear at the outset that I do not wish to anticipate the outcome of the discussions
Firstly , these negotiations are taking place against a background of widely differing approaches to agriculture in the United States and the European Union
In contrast , the European Union has set ceilings for expenditure on agriculture
Further , the Union is implementing a policy on decoupling , just as the United States have abandoned theirs
The Union is also reluctant to apply Community preferences , as was the case in the incident concerning cereals from the Black Sea
Clearly , these contrasts reflect differing degrees of political will
The United States wishes its agriculture to remain strong
As for Europe , it is divided on this issue , as it is on so many others
Europe is even divided on the very appropriateness of a public agricultural policy
It is divided too on the resources such a policy should have available
In the proposal on agriculture made by the United States in the context of Doha , significant public support for its agriculture is retained
It would therefore be both paradoxical and unacceptable for European agriculture to be stranded high and dry at the end of the process
We must stand firm
Developing countries cannot become shi@@ elds concealing this aim
After all , the European Union is the largest importer of agricultural products from developing countries in the world
In addition , the Union is the only party to have created a system of non-@@ reciprocal preferences in the framework of the Lomé Convention and subsequently of the Cotonou Convention
I mean proper provision , not mere lip service
I have in mind the requirement for traceability , the rejection of social dumping , concern for the environment and authorised protection of designations of origin
Mr President , these issues have to be central to negotiations
I trust you will take all this on board , Commissioner
There are marked differences in the positions of the main negotiating parties , and there will be pressure on all , including the European Union , to compromise
The European Union negoti@@ ates at the World Trade talks on the basis of a mandate which was approved by the Council of Ministers back in September 1999
That was subsequently endorsed by the General Affairs Council
That mandate is based on the Agenda 2000 agreement , one of the main objectives of which was to prepare the EU for the WTO negotiations
Last December the Commission presented a draft paper which it said is consistent with the EU 's negotiating mandate at WTO level , as approved by the Council in 1999
Ireland and France had difficulty with a number of specific issues , and a small number of amendments were introduced at the Council to meet these concerns
The most important of these issues for Ireland related to improved market access , or the reduction of import tariffs
In 2002 , 60 % of Irish farm incomes were in the form of direct payments to producers which qualify for ' blue@@ box ' exemption
The retention of export subsidies is also a major issue to us , as a major exporter of agricultural and food products to third countries
We are particularly dependent on the continuation of an EU system of export subsidies in order to remain competitive on export markets
We still need answers from Commissioner Fischler as to how he is going to square that circle
Yes , we have a duty of care to the developing world , but that must go hand in hand with the duty of care to our own farmers
Mr President , it is clear that there are still major differences of opinion in this Parliament
Certainly , when I hear the opinions of the traditional farmers ' front , it is clear that this Parliament still has much work to do
From a Socialist point of view , world trade is about fair play for all
It is essential that we achieve breakthrough in the negotiations on the agricultural portfolio
We would like to secure two things in this regard
Firstly we would like to see an end to the dumping of products from Europe and the USA on the markets of developing countries
In other words , less , but spread out more exten@@ si@@ vel@@ y; less support for large-scale farm@@ ers; more support for quality and a reasonable existence for farmers
The latter is essential , as liberalisation is one thing , but we do not want the market to do everything
What we need is public supervision and regulation
We are talking about a social model for Europe
In our opinion it is clear that the proposals now being put forward are a good starting point
At the same time we would like to ask Commissioners Lamy and Fischler to make more than 50 % of agricultural products from developing countries tax-free
We would like to see change phased in before 2011
What we would like to see is over 30 % off the tariffs , and in 30 % less time
We wholeheartedly endorse the concept of the Food Bo@@ x
We also realise , however , that the AC@@ S countries must do their homework better and come up with proposals more quickly
Then there is the USA , of course
It is clear that the USA , with its Farm Bill , is currently going completely against the spirit and the facts of Doha
This places us in an enormous dilemma
The liberalisation of agricultural trade has its advocates and its opponents
My mind is quite open as to whether the European agricultural model , combining multifunctionality with a policy of subsidies , can be implemented with any international legitimacy
On the other hand , the WTO 's fundamental categories do not include issues of rural development , environmental protection and animal welfare
What is true of enlargement must also be true of the WTO negotiations , the principle being that nobody should be any worse off
The situation before the negotiations and after them will be considered in that light , so we can look forward to the result with some excitement
Mr President , Commissioner , agriculture will certainly be one of the most sensitive issues at Can@@ cu@@ n
When all is said and done , agriculture represents an economic and social market framework the countries of the Southern hemisphere can only dream of
You are mandated to bear the European Union 's great responsibility in this field
I believe the countries of the south should consider the Union their staun@@ chest ally
We must therefore ensure that every person 's fundamental right to have food is not sacrificed on the altar of the go@@ d of trade and financial transactions
When it comes down to it , agriculture is an indicator of public welfare the world over , as was stated a moment ago
For the countries of the south , it involves food security , and also the quality of food , water and the soil
It means recognition of regional products , the preservation of the landscape and the sustainable development of rural areas
All this applies to the countries of the north as well as to the countries of the south
Hence , as you said , your mandate should demonstrate there is no selfishness on our part , and that we are willing to eliminate a number of export subsidies
These subsidies are also ruining small farmers within the European Union
The right of peoples and countries to feed themselves with local , healthy products should allow them to take protectionist measures when necessary
If your safeguard clause reflects this right , it will go hand-in-hand with fair-@@ trade , and would be a welcome extension of the ' Everything but arms ' initiative
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , two new worrying developments have emerged in connection with the latest round of WTO negotiations
The atmosphere has changed due to the strong pressure exerted by the United States representatives on their European counterparts
Mr Robert Z@@ o@@ el@@ lick has referred to European partners such as France and Ireland as coloni@@ alists who are two hundred years behind the times
You are an exception Commissioner , as you have all but been awarded an hon@@ or@@ ary doc@@ torate by the Bush administration
All this has taken place against the background of references to ' Old Europe ' , or even che@@ ese-@@ eating mon@@ keys
We know that your opposite number Mr Robert Z@@ o@@ el@@ lick , signed an open letter from Mr Wol@@ f@@ ow@@ itz in January 1998 calling for a war on Iraq
You seem to be negotiating with a ha@@ w@@ k Commissioner
The subject of negotiations has also changed
To date , we had been discussing subjects which lacked soul
Now , as we discuss agriculture , we are negotiating on quality , the environment , welfare , animals and consequently essentially cultural matters
The present round does not concern goods
It concerns knowledge
It concerns the very essence of people , and their very being
Hence the fear of no@@ th@@ ing@@ ness , as the Lou@@ vain students made clear to you
Agriculture constitutes an exception to the rule
There is its unique structure , the A@@ O@@ Cs and the countryside
Hence the deep-rooted fear that you might not stand up for this agricultural exception which goes right back to M@@ eso@@ pota@@ mia
It is nothing new
Serious misgivings ab@@ ound , and they are mainly of a political nature
We fear that Can@@ cu@@ n will be a ' Munich in the sun '
There are moreover precedents for this
There is the mysterious agreement of 2001 on bananas
Chi@@ quita collapsed just like Enron
There is the failure to challenge the issue of dependency on oil-producing crops , even after the opening-up of former Eastern bloc countries and the consequences of mad cow disease
Above all there is Mr Fischler 's project , begun in July 2002 and confirmed in January 2003 , which involved deep cuts in subsidies
At the same time , the United States established proposals to spend 190 billion over ten years from May 2002
Nonetheless , the de minimis rule would keep all this within the green box
Our fears are also based on an un@@ fa@@ th@@ om@@ able contradiction
Surely it cannot be right to destroy our agricultural infrastructure and know-how when by 2020 there will be two billion more mouths to feed
This is the basis of my fundamental fear
Commissioner , we seem to be already condemned as we speed along on board the shut@@ tle Earth which is as riddled with cracks as the shut@@ tle Columbia
Yet here we are discussing commerce and global free-trade when we know drinking water supplies are dwindling and when two billion people lack electricity or medicine
I am beginning to wonder therefore whether the WTO , like the European Union , is a museum piece
Commissioner , the subject of this evening 's debate is certainly the basis for a tape@@ stry of some of the major themes of world and European politics
In our opinion , however , the agreement must be well balanced and must be an agreement which benefits everybody
It would appear that this is also the position which Commissioner Fischler has upheld on a number of occasions with regard to Community agricultural policies
Then there is another major political theme which is connected with the subject of this evening 's debate
We need an overall perspective on the matter
What was to be a mid-term assessment review has become a veritable transformation of European agriculture
This principle of food safety has been expressed and accepted at WTO level too , but it has only been accepted as an ideal
Much progress will be needed before quality equal to that of our own produce is guaranteed
European farms operating in a globalised context must invest in the quality of their produce to acquire specific market shares which are sensitive to new consumer demands
Production standards are now oriented towards ensuring the traceability of production from stable to table
Therefore , the basic issue before us now is that the proposal you have outlined to us this evening , Commissioner , contains a principle
We need a common agricultural policy which preserves the conventions we are used to
I would also like to say that the commitment to greater openness must be accompanied by a fair distribution of responsibilities amongst the developed countries
In this regard , we must condemn the unilateral nature of the United States ' agricultural policy
Commissioner , I am concerned , however , that the model of agricultural multifunctionality may be jeopardised
I must tell you that in the proposal for negotiation multifunctional considerations are mentioned just once when the Commission refers to access to the market for the poorest countries
The inviolable principle behind all European Union decisions is how best to serve the interests of big business and the multinationals
The proposed WTO agreement speeds up the liberalisation of the international trade in agricultural produce on the pretext that international trade will increase and benefit the developing countries
The same was said of GATT , and look what happened there
GATT was going to increase the international trade in agricultural produce and generate wealth
All that happened was that the multinationals producing and selling agricultural produce sent their profit figures so@@ aring
The same will happen with the WTO agreement , for three basic reasons
The first has to do with the approach , which favours monopolies , as did GATT
The second has to do with the international system of prices and subsidies for agricultural produce and the international system of prices for industrial goods
The rich countries buy cheap agricultural produce and sell expensive industrial goods , including medicines
This is no mean feat
If the European Union is to have a credible voice in the Doha process , this pro@@ cra@@ st@@ ination must stop
With enlargement on our doorstep we must act immediately
The Commission 's proposals will benefit European farmers in the long term and improve prospects for meaningful global trade liberalisation talks
It is a very difficult balancing act
Mr President , Commissioner , what I actually would like to do is to address just a few points , as my colleagues have already had a lot to say
Add to that the complications with your trading partners , and the whole thing , taken together , amounts to a thoroughly tricky act
We may well be able to do a great deal for the environment and agriculture , but there is the risk of other instruments falling by the wayside
Commissioner , both you and Commissioner Fischler have , I believe , always said that we have enough room to manoeuvre
We have flexibility
We have to look at the details , perhaps at the milk prices for example , or in other areas , to see what else we might do
Let me conclude with a very brief question
Perhaps you could say something about this
And the proposals and the timetable for applying them are nothing if not specific
The overall package being contributed to the forthcoming WTO negotiations by the European Union puts the ball very firmly in the European Union 's court
Rather than just tabling proposals , it needs to make a studied demand for something in return
It is both pointless and unacceptable to make it easier to import agricultural produce from developing countries which do not meet European standards
I am not sure this is news but it is nevertheless the case
We should ask ourselves what is really at stake in this whole affair of multinational commercial agricultural negotiations
The issue is whether the European Union can and should subscribe to controls , ceilings and rules
In the future these would limit the support and protection we currently afford to our farmers and would like to continue to afford them
Further , I would like to remind you of some of the principles on which my position and Mr Franz Fischler 's position are based
I would then like to dwell on two or three points in a little more detail
Firstly , at Doha we made a number of commitments on negotiations
Our undertakings went considerably further than those we gave on the previous occasion
I am referring to Marrakech in 1995
We agreed to increase market access by reducing our support within the Union and reducing export subsidies
These matters form part of our negotiation mandate
In allocating concessions , we should give priority to developing countries and ensure that concessions and consequently control measures are applied in an equitable manner
There is no question of the European Union as part of the developed world accepting control measures other developed countries would reject
I would now like to outline my third and last general principle
This debate is not the same as our internal debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy
The debate over our position in relation to the World Trade Organisation is quite separate from the internal debate on the reform of the common agricultural policy
We are not debating the reform of the common agricultural policy in Geneva , Tokyo , Washington , Sydney or Can@@ cu@@ n
It will be debated internally , along our own lines
It is true that we are debating our position in relation to the World Trade Organisation in Brussels and Strasbourg , but in the spirit I described
The Commission has indeed put forward a proposal
If adopted , it will usher in further reforms in the management of the common agricultural policy
It remains to be seen if and when these decisions are taken
It has yet to be established also which of these decisions will be used as negotiating tools and when
This is not the case at the moment however
They do not compromise the eventual outcome of other reforms in any way
You have already responded to this question I think
Some of you think our proposals lack ambition and others think they go too far
Mrs McNally made it clear that , in her opinion , we could have gone further
I would like to say that I do not believe we could have gone any further , at least not at this stage
Now for the question of whether we are going too far
I believe this is what Mr Hyland is concerned about
I do think however that we have already gone too far in reforming the common agricultural policy in recent years
This was perhaps the essence of what Mr Hyland was saying
As you can well imagine , this is not the view of the Commission
I would now like to address the points made by Mr van Dam , Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and Mrs Erika Mann
They rightly pointed to the issue of food security
They based their arguments on the fact that in agriculture , only 10 % of production is traded on the international market
This contrasts with the situation in other sectors
They are right in what they say and this is why we have introduced a new measure that has been widely commented upon
We are building in the concept of food security , a safeguard clause , a separate section devoted to food security
As I said in my introductory intervention , we have taken inspiration from various quarters , in particular non-governmental organisations
Before I finish , I would like to respond to Mr Mulder
These rules are very restrictive and some of the countries believe they are excessively so
It is therefore right the rules should be so rigorous
I would say two lessons have been learnt from this debate
The first is that Mr Martinez appears to have certain exis@@ tential concerns
This in itself is excellent news
The second is that , for once , there are excellent reasons for such concerns
On this occasion , I do actually share the view that agriculture concerns not just goods but our very being
I am sure my colleague Mr Fischler would agree on this too
Mr Martinez is right on this point
Agriculture is about goods that are produced , distributed and end up on our own or other people 's plates
Agriculture is also about a service , however , and there is far less talk about that
The goods component of agriculture can be found on the market and in trade links
Go@@ ods are bought and sold
In general it is poorly served by market forces
Agriculture is therefore made up of two interdependent elements
This is the service component , and because of it we have a special relationship with what we eat and what we produce
The coexistence of the goods and the service components of agriculture is at the root of the difficulties we are up against
This is how we in Europe perceive agriculture and this is why Europe has adopted a balanced position on a number of outcomes
We are not , however , prepared to sacrifice what we believe to be the collective cost of agriculture
We will pursue this concept of the two aspects of agriculture in our discussions
We should , if possible , debate the negotiation program as a whole , and not bit by bit dis@@ jo@@ inte@@ dly as we have this evening
Mr Franz Fischler and I are certainly willing to do so
As an exception to the rule , I will give the floor to Mr De Rossa
Mr President , I apologise for being late
I wanted to speak because my position in relation to agriculture is not the same as the position presented to this House by a number of other Irish Members
I say this because it is important for the variety of opinion that exists in relation to farming to be on the record
I welcome the proposals put forward by the Commission in relation to farming
That is an issue we have not yet come to grips with in Ireland or , to some extent , in the rest of Europe
To end this debate , I have received six motions for resolutions presented in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure
Most of the countries worst affected by AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis are unable to produce the necessary treatments themselves
For@@ ty-@@ two million people are infected with AIDS in the world
Only 36 000 people are receiving treatment in Africa
Every day , 40 000 people die from infectious disease
The situation is therefore serious and urgent
Hundreds of thousands of human lives are at risk
The European Commission has chosen to give the profits of the pharmaceutical industries precedence over life
Together with my group , I support the many NGOs that are asking for matters relating to public health to fall outside the scope of the WHO
In this respect the proposal represents a first step towards defining a strong concept of citizenship of the European Union , as confirmed by the basic aim of the proposal
The proposal also introduces important innovations by comparison to the existing acquis
It establishes a system in which the European Union citizen has simply to declare that he fulfils the conditions linked to the exercise of the right of residence
Finally , it introduces after four years of uninterrupted residence a permanent right of residence which is no longer subject to any conditions
As is rightly underlined in Mr Santini 's report , the right to free movement is still subject today to many obstacles
This has been confirmed in the repeated judgments of the Court of Justice on the matter
Indeed , the directive we are discussing represents a genuine leap forward in the debate on citizenship of the Union and the free movement of persons
The introduction of the right to permanent residence is a concrete example of this
Before looking at the directive in more detail , we should specify its scope
It is directed at Community citizens and members of their families , of whatever nationality
This is a right derived from the right of the Community citizen of whose family they are members
The great merit of this directive is that it combines all the previous provisions on the subject in a single text
The most innovative elements include the proposal to replace the residence card , as the Commissioner mentioned , with a simple certificate of registration with the competent authorities
The registration procedures must be straightforward and direct and , in any case , the principle of self-@@ certification must be applied , as it already is in some Member States
The principle of self-@@ certification must also apply to the provision of proof of income and health insurance cover too
A further innovative principle introduced by the directive concerns the expulsion of third country citizens who are entitled to residence on Community territory
The directive stipulates that they cannot be expelled under any circumstances whatsoever
Moreover , there is no ambiguity over the definition of spouse in terms of Community law , as the Court of Justice has confirmed on a number of occasions
In short , each Member State can regulate family issues on the basis of its own legislation and concerns
We have the opportunity to give the citizens new , modern rules which provide greater guarantees of civil liberties
Madam President , European citizenship was one of the great achievements of the Union Treaty adopted in Nice in 1992
This was the purpose of the amendments adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market
I believe this amendment is essential if we do not want to move backwards in terms of the rights of European citizens within the Union
The proposed amendments submitted by the European Parliament have of course improved the Commission 's proposal significantly
In other words , they are automatically deprived of any legal rights derived from their residing in another Member State of the Union
More and more Member States are finding ways of recognising couples who live together without officially getting married
Most countries now allow partners to be officially registered and this category therefore needs to be included in the definition of family members
Such is our objective towards which we are journe@@ ying , and I am convinced that we can reach that objective providing that certain conditions are complied with
We should arrive at a compromise , and do so by accepting the fact that the various states have different conceptions of this and make different arrangements for it
What we should not be doing is allowing the few to take it upon themselves to impose their concept and definition of the family on all the other states
If we can manage to stand back and arrive at consensus by accepting individual Member States ' diverse arrangements , this proposal will win acceptance by a broad majority
In the interests of EU citizens ' freedom of movement , I appeal to all those who have introduced these proposals to follow where reason leads
The citizenship rights and the Union as a whole will only have credibility amongst the citizens if they can be applied in practice in their everyday lives
Consequently , these rights are of a constituent and not a declar@@ ative nature
In other words they are acquired regardless of any permission granted by the Member States
We welcome the Commission 's proposal , which we consider to be a genuine step forward
The movement of the Union 's citizens amongst the Member States should be carried out mu@@ ta@@ tis mut@@ and@@ is in conditions similar to those of the citizens of a particular State
In reality , Madam President , the Union 's citizens have taken this principle on board much more quickly and thoroughly than their governments
They have taken it on board and they exercise it
It cannot be demonstrated whether these people have spent the last six months in their house , because sometimes it is 60 km from the neighbouring country
The euro will make this even easier and more possible and I hope that progress can be made within the Commission
The purpose of the directive is to give more content to EU citizenship and to increase people 's freedom of movement within the Community
The proposal would mean a consolidation of the present multi@@ plicity of regulations , directives and judgments in this area
In this way , the state of the law would become clearer and less ambiguous
This directive is a step in the right direction
We also , however , support the progressive definition of the family incorporated into the proposal
On a general note , I should like to state straight away that the intention behind the proposal is not to lay down a definition of the family
The intention is , quite basically , to preserve family unity
Of course , European citizens should be protected from these dangers too
Certainly , a great deal remains to be done , as Mrs Karamanou and Mr Medina Ortega have made clear
Madam President , my group is also very happy with the proposed directive as well as with the report
In fact people often think that it has already been settled , and they are then disappointed to find out that free movement is not as free as they thought
This is about a Swede who wants to go and live and work in Italy , for example
Now I know that some Members of this Parliament , and particularly some Member States , think that this is about migration
It is mainly about the free movement of EU citizens and only concerns people from third countries if they are married to or are in long-term relationships with EU citizens
So let us keep it in perspective
A great deal has been said about this in the report , the definition has been broadened and my group is satisfied with that
I conclude from Mr Pirker 's amendments and comments , however , that the definition remains extremely controversial
Mar@@ ri@@ age - we think that this is log@@ ic@@ al; the person 's spouse must be allowed to accompany them
We also think registered partnerships are sur@@ moun@@ table; the person 's registered partner must also be allowed to accompany them
We have difficulty with long-term relationships , however
I would therefore like to quote Mr Pirker , to show that I have been listening to him closely
' We must distance ourselves from the idea that only a few people know what the definition of ' family ' is
You can also look at alterna@@ tiv@@ es; how long people have been living together , for example
There are alterna@@ tiv@@ es; the most important thing is that people are committed to each other , that they have a family life
Madam President , both the rapporteur , Mr Santini , and the Commission applaud European citizenship
This is now to be given concrete shape in the proposal to give EU citizens the right of free movement and residence
' becoming an integral part of the legal heritage of every citizen of the European Union ' , according to the Commission
Precisely what heritage does the Commission mean here ?
I find this pronouncement just as surprising as the term ' European citizenship '
Because a Dutch person can go and work in France more easily , he suddenly feels like a European citizen
But no , he is still a Dutch person working in France
From a practical point of view it is a good and even modernising proposal
It will eliminate a lot of red tape and uncontrollable rules
I think that there are two points on which I believe the Commission is encro@@ aching too far on the Member States ' decision-making authority
Firstly in article 25 , in which a host country is prohibited from issuing an expulsion order when the person concerned has obtained a permanent right of residence
Then in article 30 , paragraph 2 , which states that a person may re@@ submit a request for admission no more than two years after expulsion
I cannot support the amendments in the Santini report that extend the definition of partner and that tone down the Commission 's amendments
This is our request
This is the point , and that is why I am asking the Members of the other groups not to remove the phrase ' irrespective of sex '
The objection has been raised that it is unnecessary , that it is superfluous
We are not lawyers or bar@@ ris@@ ters
We simply believe that this phrase , this expression should be preserved in the text
free movement irrespective of sex of persons who have entered into marriage or unmarried partnerships
This is a welcome proposal
There are , nevertheless , two areas that have already been mentioned in this debate , which still pose problems
I believe that common sense would here dictate respect for national law and for the provisions laid down in each Member State
This could lead to an enormous increase in the number of people requesting family reunification
The widening of the definition proposed by Mr Santini is therefore acceptable on humanitarian grounds or on serious health grounds
Madam President , I thank the rapporteur and the Commission for bringing forward this important report , dealing as it does in a sound way with significant matters
We in this Parliament must endeavour to do all we can to make it easier for European citizens to move freely around the Union
Mr Vitorino said at the beginning that free movement is subject to too many obstacles , and Mrs Buitenweg has just given some examples that make this obvious
However , just as with business , in order for this to function efficiently there must be regulations
For example , British pensioners reti@@ ring to Spain and others travelling from one country to another for work must be freed from unnecessary bureaucracy and excessive red tape
However , there are aspects of this report which could be misinterpreted or abused
That is why we need to build in a few extra clauses
As we are all too aware , we live in a dangerous world
Therefore , we should not deny Member States the right to exclude people where there is a proven threat to national security
We need a few other safeguards to protect people from the hazards of modern living
the real issue is not whether people are married or with whom they are in a lasting relationship
The Treaty guarantees the right of all citizens to family life and we , as a Parliament , are empowered to uphold this
Others have spoken about this
Le@@ gi@@ tim@@ ate and lasting partnerships should never be put under threat
Madam President , this proposal finally delivers on the 50-@@ year-old promise to allow EU citizens and their families to reside in another Member State
It is great news for the cause of freedom
But to listen to some , including ' conservatives ' in the British Labour Government , you would think it was all about facilitating illegal immigration and terrorism
It is time for this misinformed hysteria in the UK to stop
There are sufficient safeguards in this measure and in EU law
On the definition of family that EU citizens can take with them when they move , this must at least respect the law in the country of original residence
Why should a Swedish gay registered partnership lose all recognition of status when they move , for instance , to Italy ?
Governments , including the British one , are very happy to champion the mutual recognition principle in criminal penalties , including the European arrest warrant
Let us also champion it for freedom and rights for people , including British people
What is under discussion is the rights of EU citizens and their family members
How , today , do we define the family ?
Does ' family ' include unmarried couples of whatever gender ?
At the same time , it strikes me that a European definition of the family is urgently needed; after all , it is what we have to work with
This means that we need an independent legal status for spouses
As I see it , a family exists when someone takes on the responsibility for educating someone else , providing for them , and caring for them
I welcome in this report the wider definition of ' family ' and the importance given to the consideration of humanitarian grounds in the application of this directive
On the wider definition , we must examine our prejudice and our firmly held beliefs
This is about national citizenship and EU citizenship
We must move forward at a pace which must not be dictated by the Member State least likely to reform
This is either about the free movement of all of our citizens or it is not
Baroness Ludford is absolutely right
There should be a principle of mutual recognition here
The present labour market and the opportunities for study and enjoying your retirement in a country other than the one you come from call for Europe to have flexible rules
They should not hinder anyone unnecessarily
Mr Pirker says that is a minor detail@@ ; to me it looks like a disaster
Even two men or two women who were married in the Netherlands or in Belgium cannot go to Greece together if one of them is going to work there
Imagine what it must feel like
This approach , however , results in discrimination on the basis of nationality , something that was prohibited in the European Union a long time ago
It is an odd matter that we have to fix
This system ensures that all possible forms of relationship are mutually recognised by the Member States
Fortunately there are already eight Member States who enable their citizens to do so
This freedom of choice must not , however , be lost when these citizens cross the border
I am therefore pleased that the vast majority of this Parliament appears to support the application of the principle of mutual recognition in this area
This is a big step forward and augurs well for the coming discussions with the Council
So if that is the case , why does my group want to retain the phrase ' irrespective of sex ' ?
To us , partial equality is no equality at all
Given this doubt , there can be no harm in promoting the rights of homosexual men and women a little more in the meantime
Madam President , freedom of movement is the core of EC law
We must turn freedom of movement into a reality within the EU
I therefore welcome uniform regulations that may make it easier for people to move without difficulty between the various Member States of the EU
In order to encourage increased movement within the EU , we must begin by simplifying the rules
The rules must also be generous
I am especially pleased that this committee has proposed extending the concept of the family
They must be entitled to feel sure that the same rights apply to us all
That is of course a challenge for many in the EU since it brings traditional thinking into question
We must nonetheless accept that challenge and the opportunity it provides , precisely because we live in a common union and wish to create a common EU citizenship
Ultimately , we are concerned here with respect and the equal value of every person
The regulations governing family issues in the EU must be generous and non-discriminatory
Let me turn to the two controversial issues during this debate
In this very sensitive field , the Community must respect the developments introduced in Member State legislation and must be flexible in this
There is no universal legal solution for this kind of de facto partnership or for registered partnerships or same sex marriages
However , I recognise that the problem arises when one of them is a third-country national
In fact , at present , the legislation of only two Member States recognises union between persons of the same sex as marriage
Under the case law of the Court of Justice , the term ' marriage ' design@@ ates a union between persons of the opposite sex
I understand the argument of mutual recognition , but one has to be very careful when using it
In addition , the principle of non-discrimination requires that the host Member State treat unmarried couples of other Member States in the same way as its own nationals
I believe therefore that everyone will agree , particularly in this field , that we should not create reverse discrimination
That would be the actual outcome of such a proposal
I will follow your deliberations tomorrow and the negotiations with Council very closely
I am sure that all of you are aware of the difficulty of this debate and the different approaches of the Member States
The Commission considers it preferable to reconsider the proposal and to better scrutinise the content of the Court of Justice judgment
We will bring forward an amended proposal as soon as possible
Madam President , I would like to ask the Commissioner a question
He said that the only problem for a couple in a registered partnership was when one of them was a foreign national
If they are both EU nationals , under Article 18 , they could both independently move to another State
His answer does not address that issue
It is not just an immigration question , it is also a question of recognition as a family
I do not think he can just get around that , and I believe the mutual recognition argument has strong force , as in other sectors like criminal law
That is the heart of the issue
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at midday
I should like nonetheless to put forward a criticism concerned with an aspect that , unfortunately , has not been taken into account
By way of the proposed directive , we put forward a framework which , once approved , will lead Member States to be open and transparent about their immigration policies
This is very much a step forward
Nowadays , Member States do not know what each other 's immigration policy really is
Many of the national immigration policies have in the past been simply conducted by stealth
What the public knows is that those who come in illegally , end up having their situation legalised by Member States in one way or another
Our proposal is a first step aimed at ending such a pattern
In this respect , it must be pointed out that such rights do not cover the right to stay unemployed in the European Union
The proposal further helps to streamline cumbersome procedures and to bring about clarity and legal security
The Commission is certainly not creating a subjective right to immigration
Its aim is simply to harmonise the procedure for admission and it believes such harmonisation is necessary
All the more so as we mostly live in a bord@@ er-free area where decisions affect our neighbours
The European Union must primarily mobilise its existing human resources , including migrant workers currently residing legally in the European Union
More must be done on training , bringing older people and women into the labour market
In this respect , the proposal gives a clear preference to the domestic labour market
There is , therefore , no incompatibility between the fight against unemployment and the proposal
Our unemployed have four weeks in which to show up and take jobs free from the competition of foreign workers
Immigration numbers are one of our citizens ' priorities , and one of the areas where they clearly expect us to tackle the problem at European level
I hope that this debate and its impact on the Council will allow us to move forward
Parliament should also have given its opinion some time ago , but we always lag behind on these issues
The Commission 's proposed directive is intended to harmonise the conditions for entry and residence for nationals of third countries who intend to enter a Member State for employment reasons
The proposal lays down a contract at origin for the immigrant worker , except for those who reside legally within the European Union for other reasons
The residence permit and the work permit would be combined as one single document
For my part , I welcome the Commission 's proposal
Some of the measures studied by the Commission , such as mobility , moved in the right direction and reality will oblige us to return to them
Madam President , this is just an opinion report
But for procedural reasons we have had to present a package of amendments and these must reflect two fundamental issues
We need clear rules which can be complied with
Neither have we accepted the amendments which introduced requirements other than employment and which were difficult to verify
If we accept that the possibility of performing a job of work is what legitimises entry and residence in the Union , we must then ensure that this system works
Even in a situation of unemployment , this would simply become paralysed
Madam President , I thank the rapporteur
The majority position of my committee is that we need to simplify and clarify the procedures
That was from an employee at UN@@ IC@@ E , the employers ' federation
We supported the EC@@ OS@@ O@@ C proposal to look at the idea of a job-@@ seeker 's permit , which could be of great assistance to small - and medium-sized enterprises
But , by this proposal for a directive , you are putting down a marker to the effect that ' immigration is a right
You , on Thursday , will not be returning to a country in which , at present , 4
6 million people are unemployed
Or , to put the question another way , are there schools in Portugal in which half the children do not understand Portuguese ?
Incidentally , the film 's German title translates as ' They know not what they do '
Despite high unemployment in Germany , there are still at present many positions that remain unfilled
One of the reasons for this is that the education system has been run into the ground
What you are now saying is , ' do not worry about reforming your own country 's educational system - we shall just get immigrants to do the jobs
' - but that cannot be the solution
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the directive presented by Commissioner Vitorino will be the found@@ ational European draft law on immigration into Europe
This is happening at a time when we have 15 million unemployed in Europe , and when , in my own country , the figure is nearing 5 million
You are opening up this possibility if a position cannot be filled within four weeks
This shows that the four-@@ week period is absur@@ dly short and will , as I have said , put our unemployed under much more pressure
The Council has been attempting to dig@@ est this draft since as long ago as July 2001
Madam President , I would like to thank the Commissioner and the rapporteur for her report
I very much applaud the principle of having brought this up for debate
It is a major step towards a common European immigration policy
Without legal means , many people resort to dangerous and illegal ways of circum@@ venting frontiers
Without legal migration , we will struggle to meet our target of making Europe the most competitive economy in the world by 2010
I was saddened by what Mr Nassauer has said
We have to move the debate forward
There are 350 million people in the European Union at the moment and there will soon be 500 million
He has highlighted that 50 million of those may be unemployed , 5 million of them in Germany
We do not want to take all the doctors and nurses and teachers from developing countries simply because we need them
So we have got to have a properly balanced scheme , with legal migration that respects individuals and respects their position , supporting both third countries and the EU
Madam President , on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , I should like to welcome Mrs Terrón i Cusí 's report
It is an important and necessary report
The conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities vary greatly from one Member State to another
What is proposed would rectify this situation
Adoption of the directive would lead to common rules being laid down governing the rights and duties of third-country nationals
The directive would also ensure that the existing rules were enforced equ@@ itably
What is proposed would give easier access to the labour force , and flexibility and mobility in the European labour market would in that way be increased
At the same time , the directive contains safety clauses worded strongly enough to restrict economic migration
I believe that adoption of this report would entail some clear benefits
For one thing , procedural clarity and much needed harmonisation of the rules governing this group of third-country nationals would be created within the EU area
Furthermore , what is proposed would increase the legal rights of this group of self-supporting third country nationals who have entered their countries of residence legally
Finally , what is proposed would give the Member States a tool ensuring their ability to respond quickly to changes in the economic and demographic conditions in the labour market
Contrary to a previous speaker , I hope that the proposal will be well received by the Council with a view to its being adopted quickly
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the proposal being examined today is aimed at establishing a harmonised legal framework for the conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals
On this subject , it has to be stated that the European Union is still a very weak vessel
We can only regret the hypocrisy of European policies
There is no hesitation in ch@@ err@@ y-@@ picking the most promising immigrants , or those who serve our interests
Yes , Mrs Terrón i Cusí is right
The immigration issue must be part of an overall , long-term vision of the EU 's policy as a community
In this context , there is good reason for tackling the issues relating to the management of migration flows
Everyone knows that a citizens ' Europe cannot be built upon forms of discrimination that give rise to injustice and exclusion and that engender racism
It is therefore our responsibility to work for a humanitarian and Community-@@ based policy on immigration , and one that respects fundamental rights and reaffirms immigration as an opportunity for Europe
what exactly is the point of it ?
The explanatory memorandum gives three reasons for it
First of all , current rules relating to the admission of third-country workers apparently differ from one Member State to another
Where , however , is the difficulty ?
Here again , however , this is a problem for the Member States and one in which the EU authorities should not interfere
The third reason cited is that the regulations governing the immigration of third-country workers is apparently a cornerstone of general immigration policy
That proves nothing , for the Treaty of Amsterdam has not turned immigration in general into an EU matter
All things considered , such Community harmonisation of work permits is not justified
It would serve only to open immigration policy up a little more at a time when we already have too many unemployed
Moreover , this proposal for a directive would lay the foundations for still greater centralisation in the future
It can be seen where all that would lead us if this directive were to be adopted
In our view , the proposal exceeds , firstly , the legislative competence of the European Union
Whilst the Treaty establishing the European Communities provides specific rules on immigration , the attempt is made here to lay down a general rule of the European Union
That is the present situation , and that is the way it should stay
The approach contained in the Commission proposal is equally ill-@@ chosen , as it is based on the assumption that immigration is generally necessary
From that assumption you de@@ duce that immigration is a right , and an ac@@ tionable one at that
Such a thing exists nowhere on earth , and we do not want to have it in future either
And when this proposal is developed by the addition of proposals originating in the committee , the report goes so far that we cannot vote in favour of it
The current reality , with migratory flows which are speeding up all the time , is reflected every day in the Spanish press
We see thousands of Moroc@@ cans and Sub@@ -@@ Saharan Africans arriving on our territory looking for work
The fight against illegal immigration requires the regulation of legal immigration
I therefore welcome the Commission 's proposal since it promotes a coordinated economic migration policy
This would undoubtedly lead to exploitation by many employers and the extor@@ tion I mentioned earlier
We must improve all the possible mechanisms for the employment of immigrants from their countries of origin
We must give employers the opportunity to employ these immigrants so that the relationship between the immigrants in the State of origin and the employers is as fluid as possible
This is the reason why immigration is so necessary
It is also self-evident that there are economic areas in which we will need workers and others in which we will not
It is equally clear that we cannot allow , and do not want , our own workers at home to have to face competition
Thus far , we are all of one mind
Her having done that makes it a matter of course that some will end up having problems with her proposals , just as they do with the Commission 's
On the other hand , though , Mr Nassauer , I do not see why either this report or the directive from the Commission should be destined for the dustbin
Why does the Treaty on the European Communities have to be treated as if it were holy w@@ rit ?
I think this is where we could take a long view , a rather more generous approach , and demonstrate more willingness
Things that do not fit in today 's thinking could perhaps be European policy in five years ' time
It is for this reason that I can well imagine that we could adopt a much more generous approach in this area
For this reason we can only adopt the report that Mrs Terrón i Cusí has presented if the amendments retabled by the PPE-DE Group are accepted
Consequently , on the basis of this directive , immigration for the purpose of employment in the European Union will be permitted if certain conditions are met
In other words , this is a decision that can only be taken by Member States themselves and not at Community level
Secondly , the Terrón i Cusí report criticises the fact that the Commission 's initial proposal only addresses the situation of individuals who are legally present on Union territory
It also claims that illegal workers should also have the right to request a residence permit , which should be granted to them
Mr President , as in other areas of human immigration , we must always be prudent
This is not simply a matter of protecting Member State nationals
In these areas , excessively generous solutions create more problems than they are intended to resolve
Mr President , poor Mr Vitorino has one of the most difficult jobs in the Commission and he does it extremely well
I come from a country that , tragically , has a history of mass emigration over hundreds of years
In view of our history , I am perhaps a little more liberal in my thinking about these particular issues
My colleagues from Spain and Portugal have also referred to this
It is a serious problem in a small country such as my own
These immigrants are under-@@ pai@@ d; they are often hou@@ sed in disgraceful conditions
In many cases , it is as if animals rather than human beings were being brought into the country
We have to accept that Member States know their own situation best
While I agree with many of the points made by the Commissioner , we have to be realistic about these matters
The issue is not about keeping people out , but making sure that , having come in , they are treated with the dignity they deserve
I believe that we are going to do so by means of the open coordination method in a future report
I am talking about people whose illegal status has come about for bureaucratic reasons and who have not been expelled and who once again fulfil the admission criteria
I believe that this is far from promoting illegal immigration
My report in no way provides for the possibility of entering illegally and seeking work
Finally , Mr Nassauer , I regret that it pleases you that what may be a majority opinion in this House should be thrown out
I hope that the participants in the Convention take a different view and that in the future the majority opinions of this House are taken into account
The justification states that ' individuals who are illegally present in the country should , however , also be offered the opportunity ' to obtain a contract of employment
That means that the application is to be made on the basis of il@@ leg@@ al@@ ity; even your own justification says so
I recognise this is a difficult debate
I accept the criticisms , I can even admit that I can be wrong
However , what I find difficult to accept is being criticised for things that I have never said and that are not written in my proposal
I have never said that there is a right to immigration
There is no right to immigration
there is a right to asylum , but there is no right to immigration
Immigration is only a possibility
Our proposal states that very clearly
I recognise that the link between migration and unemployment is very complex
Evidence shows that migrants might affect and disrupt the internal labour market
That is a source of concern , because the existing migrants will be a burden for the social welfare state
Is there a direct link between the arrival of migrants and the re-@@ entry into the labour market of our own European citizens ?
It is unfair to say that migration policies are the reason why European Union citizens have difficulty re-@@ entering the labour market
In fact , it is the lack of reform of the welfare state that is responsible for the difficulty of encouraging people to re-@@ enter the labour market
I do not want to harmonise anything with regard to reform of the welfare state
Those rules are very interesting and we will bear them in mind
That is a fundamental principle in our proposal
I look forward to seeing Parliament 's amendments and thank you for this very interesting and stimulating debate
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
In addition , we propose to submit a report to the Council and the European Parliament on the implications of reciprocity as regards visas
We congratulate the rapporteur
This is the subject of the report we are discussing today , for which I am rapporteur
The proposal we are discussing today falls within this context
We will therefore vote in favour of the amendments which , to this end , have been presented by the Group of the Party of European Socialists
With regard to the report we are discussing now by Mr Hernández Mollar , I would like to say that this is not a happy occasion
I believe we could thereby compensate for the sad message which unfortunately we have to send today from the Union to the citizens of that country
I thank the rapporteur for his work and for accepting this amendment , because I am convinced that we share this concern
The bottom line is that we live in a European Union where there is a system of free movement of services , capital , goods and persons
The European Union , as we all know , has a population of 370 million and , with enlargement , the Union 's population will rise to 500 million
We need to address how we protect the external borders of the European Union
Trafficking in human beings is now the world 's fastest growing criminal business
The attempts that have been made at European level to tackle this problem are inadequate
We have also sadly witnessed many tragedies in recent times , as persons seeking to enter the European Union have died in awful circumstances
The battle to defeat the scourge of trafficking in human beings must be tackled at European Union level in a coordinated and structured manner
Organised criminal gangs with vast resources that are illegally trafficking human beings into the European Union cannot be allowed , under any circumstances , to operate with impunity
There are certainly many people who believe that qualified majority voting and codecision procedures should be used to tackle immigration issues
There is also a belief that the objective of a common policy on immigration should be enshrined in the proposed new treaty
This is certainly going to focus the minds of those drafting this treaty over the coming months and in the run-up to the next Intergovernmental Conference
However , the proposal that judicial cooperation in the field of civil matters should be governed by qualified majority voting is contentious
For example , Ireland and Britain have common law systems in operation , but many other European Union states have a civil law structure
This is an area that is going to have to be given the closest attention
I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report and support
The Commission cannot accept one of the amendments on purely legal grounds
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at 12 noon
It is therefore a great challenge for the European Union to do the right thing in terms of how relations with these countries develop
But all of this became deadlocked when in 1996 President Lukashenko put the brakes on the democratisation process
The various elections held since 1996 have been described by the parliamentary troika as lacking in effective democratic guarantees
This is what our proposal is aimed at
We must not forget the important role Russia can play in this process
Mr President , I very much welcome this opportunity to debate Belarus and the relations between Belarus and the European Union
I congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Marset Campos , for his excellent preparatory work
I will indicate , in my remarks , where we find ourselves in profound agreement with what the rapporteur has said
Alas , we have never been in a position to conclude a partnership and cooperation agreement with Belarus
It is obvious that the current state of relations between the European Union and Belarus is profoundly unsatisfactory for both sides
The Commission has been invited by the Copenhagen European Council to submit proposals on the EU 's future relations with its neighbours , including Belarus
I am sure a number of honourable Members , during this debate , will want to make reference to this ' New N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ s ' or ' Wi@@ der Europe ' debate
Obviously , we will have to be prepared for the moment when Belarus sends a signal that it is ready to co-@@ operate with us
I am very grateful for the clear message that this debate and Parliament 's resolution will send in this respect
I can assure you that this is the common ground we are all working on
Belarus has , on several occasions , missed these opportunities , including prior to the elections in 2000 and 2001
The Commission strongly agrees with the emphasis in the resolution on strengthening dialogue with civil society , NGOs , democratic forces , the media and with the universities in Belarus
It could never replace a strategy by Belarus itself
The driving force for this sort of change would need to come from Belarus
When calling for broader engagement in terms of assistance , we should also not forget the difficult ground we are working on in Belarus
It is the authorities , with instruments like the notorious ' Decree No 8 ' , that make the work of foreign donors and their partners in Belarus extremely difficult
We had some joint projects with the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Belarus
The de facto closure of the OSCE Assistance and Monitoring Group in Minsk last October has obviously threatened the further implementation of such projects
The coming weeks and months will demonstrate whether the authorities in Belarus are finally committed to take the path towards freedom , democracy and an improvement in human rights
Norm@@ alised relations with the OSCE could be a first step
I am very grateful to the rapporteur for the work he has done to make these things possible - we all hope - in the future
Mr President , I wish to thank Mr Marset Campos for his sterling work on this report , which has been characterised by considerable consensus
It is an extremely important debate that Commissioner Patten is drawing to our attention here
We demonstrably have a pariah state at our borders
Mr Patten intim@@ ates what might be the shape of that dialogue
As the European Parliament , it is our task to demand that a structured dialogue of this kind be brought about
What are at stake are cross-border and domestic policy matters of common interest , such as illegal immigration , the sex trade and trafficking in human beings , including women
I believe that the European Union ought in actual fact to give priority to Belarus in the present situation
Precisely now , when we are divided within the European Union , we ought to unite around those areas in which we can take vigorous action
Belarus has itself chosen the isolation to which it has been exposed
Let us join forces within the EU in the interests of new relations with Belarus , involving demands for democracy and human rights
The mark on its report card is quite plainly devastating
In fact you could say that the reverse has been the case
This is most deplorable as far as the 10 million inhabitants of that country are concerned , for they deserve better
The politics of that country stand in the way of improvements in relations and are therefore also hindering the desired cooperation in numerous areas , including in the humanitarian sphere
Until such time as President Lukashenko takes a significant step towards greater democracy , it will not be possible for the European Union to implement a positive policy
That is a shame , because this is something we need to do , not least on account of our future borders with the country
Without internal dynamics there , without an internal democratic movement , the situation is not going to change in the near future
Help for the victims of Chernobyl must also be improved
We have already discussed in this Parliament the provision of additional support for cancer hospitals in Belarus in the context of the Budget
Mr Marset Campos ' report also includes an implicit call to the Russian Federation to be more concerned about the democratic credentials of the regime in Belarus
More than once I have watched the Russians congratulate President Lukashenko on an election result after the entire Council of Europe and the EU had rejected it
This is of course unacceptable
This is the kind of contradiction that will get us nowhere
Do the Russians actually intend to create a union with a country whose leadership has such a poor reputation with the European Union and the other European organisations ?
I therefore ask the Council and the Commission in particular to be more emphatic about this point in consultations with the Russian Federation
It is to be hoped that this concept will be reflected in the coming communication about an enlarged Europe
We hope that the country can introduce democracy , human rights and principles characteristic of a state governed by law
We hope that a market economy will be introduced so that the badly afflicted Bel@@ or@@ u@@ sian people might experience economic prosperity and dare to believe in the future
Unfortunately , we are an infinitely long way away from realising that vision
The trend is completely in the wrong direction , and it is no exaggeration to say that Lukashenko is an odious Communist dictator
His latest professions of friendship for his fellow dictator , Saddam Hussein are no doubt in keeping with what we know about the Bel@@ or@@ u@@ sian leader
Obviously , it is not possible to have any official and formal contacts with the Bel@@ or@@ u@@ sian regime
Even though I value the idea of a structured dialogue , I wonder how it will be possible for this to take place with the regime in question
This support would be best provided in cooperation with the OSCE , the Council of Europe and the UN
The troika , of which the European Parliament is a part , would also fulfil a very important function
The forthcoming local elections are something to focus on
My group supports Mr Marset Campos 's very well prepared report and wants to congratulate him on this work
I wish to thank Mr Marset Campos very much for an incredibly good report on a very important topic
Our con@@ federal nature also means that the group has come up with amendments with which we do not agree and , like the rapporteur , I do not support these
This makes it a very important document in the discussions on the subject of Belarus
We are a long way from being able to take up normal relations with this country
On that , Commissioner , I agree with you entirely
Despite that , the reality is that Belarus is our neighbour , and we must have an interest in overcoming its self-imposed isolation
If that cannot be done in the context of normal relations , the need still remains for the European Union to develop a strategy for dealing with Belarus
The instruments we have had up to now are inappropriate , so we must modify them to our purposes as regards Belarus
That is what this item is for , and it is my belief that it thus gives the Commission very , very good indications of what to do
I would also like to reiterate that the local elections and our observation of them will be of great importance to future relations
I hope that this is where we can enjoy very good strategic cooperation with the Commission
Mr President , the importance of Belarus to the European Union is beyond question
More than 60 % of trade between the European Union and Russia already travels through Belar@@ u@@ sian territory
After the planned accession of Poland , Lithuania and Latvia to the EU in 2004 , Belarus will be one of Europe 's new neighbours
It is therefore extremely important that we have normal relations with her
The fact that the presidential regime in Minsk has blocked this development to date is no reason to throw in the towel
We must communicate with the authorities and civil society in Belarus
The role assigned to the Russian Federation in the present resolution is right
Russia is particularly well-placed to get a foot in the door because of their mutual economic links
This is entirely in line with President Putin 's economic concept of ' modernisation through Europe@@ anisation '
In the European Union 's view , modernity in Europe is inextricably linked to the democratic constitutional state
Belarus under Lukashenko is far removed from that
Hon@@ est@@ ly , but with compassion for a population that is rapidly becoming impoverished , Mr Marset Campos points to numerous violations of elementary fundamental rights
How will the registration of Christian communities and churches work out ?
Surely freedom of religion should not be a matter for Lukashenko and the Orthodox ?
Ob@@ serv@@ ance of this important fundamental right also fur@@ thers the normalisation of relations between the EU and Belarus
By this I mean the Sakharov University in Minsk , whose work in relation to the environment may be regarded as pointing a way for others to follow
The European Union should support more reform movements of this sort , which , in the long term , will make the country more democratic
One cannot , unfortunately , sound the all-@@ clear as regards the consequences of Chernobyl
V@@ ast numbers of people are still dying in der Gom@@ el region
Lack of funding prevents people over the age of 45 being treated
The international community must give more attention to this problem and , above all , provide more material assistance
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the enlargement of the European Union will change the political landscape
We cannot regard with indifference the regression of a country , soon to be a neighbour to the European Union , into an authoritarian and dictatorial regime
Belarus is increasingly cutting itself off
We see this in the failure to extend the OSCE mission in Minsk
The Council of Europe refuses to let Belarus become a member
Thus , Belarus ' isolation is increasing , and so the situation remains utterly unchanged
Any country excluding itself in this way from European development cannot do other than become a security problem for the European Union
In terms of illegal immigration , it is to be regarded as more important as a transit country than as a country of origin
There is thus a clearly perceptible trend towards migration into Austria from the Indian sub@@ continent and Iraq by way of Belarus and the Ukraine
Over recent months , Minsk has created problems for flights to Austria
Increased numbers of illegal immigrants have been intercepted at Vienna 's Sch@@ w@@ ech@@ at airport , having travelled from Iraq and India and flown from Minsk
A structured dialogue - as soon as circumstances permit - is thus very much to be desired
Mr President , we would like to have Belarus as one of Community Europe 's neighbours and , perhaps , one day , as part of it too
Although we may wonder to what extent some countries can become part of Europe , that problem does not exist where Belarus is concerned , for it is in Europe
However , the last assessment of the situation carried out by the Council of Europe a few months ago excludes the possibility of inviting Belarus to join its Parliamentary Assembly
The next local elections will , in any case , be measurable evidence of whether any progress has been made in the area of fundamental rights
sooner or later it will happen
Let us hope that some progress is made soon
Mr President , the European Union is trying in any way it can to put pressure on Belarus to respect human rights and bring about democratic reform
Until now we have used more stick than carrot
In the future it will be wise of us to try and find more positive ways of achieving our aims
We must encourage Belarus to maintain its independence as a state and orient@@ ate itself towards European cooperation
Multilateral cooperation will provide us with a good forum for cooperation with Belarus
Posi@@ tions in the Council of Baltic Sea States will alter when the Baltic countries and Poland go from being neighbours to members of the EU
In this situation the EU must be more firmly committed than it has hitherto to the work of the Council and channel more funds to projects to be undertaken
With Union enlargement the importance of cross-border cooperation will increase
We have to encourage Latvia , Lithuania and Poland in particular to develop cross-border cooperation with Belarus
In the future the Union must be prepared to finance projects in connection with this
There must be a new scheme to provide funds created in the European Union for cross-border cooperation , either in association with TACIS or as a separate arrangement
Differences in standards of living must also be narrowed down effectively on the Union 's external borders
In other words , our aim is to choose regimes rather than recognise states
It is a form of logic that may have far-reaching consequences
In fact , it is not for us to pass judgment upon governments
Nor is it up to us to choose this or that economic model for Belarus
There could be no peace under these conditions
Let us therefore respect states as they are and peoples as they are
Whatever may happen , Belarus is a part of Europe and has been so for centuries
It will at any event be an important partner for our countries and , of course , very much so in the case of France
Mr President , Belarus is the last surviving European bas@@ tion of neo-@@ so@@ vie@@ t ideology
It is now politically important , as , in 2004 , it will become a neighbouring country of the European Union
It is also rather surprisingly still enjoying an economic growth rate of 4 %
Unfortunately , the country deteriorated into authoritarianism and the repression of linguistic and religious rights after the election of Lukashenko as president in 1994
However , he is no Saddam Hussein
Private enterprise in Belarus cannot function efficiently , and the effects of the Chernobyl disaster are still of grave concern
There is alleged harassment of the opposition , the silen@@ cing of critical voices and the establishment of a network of patron@@ age throughout the country
The European Union should await the election results and respond towards Belarus accordingly , in line with a step-by-step policy
There is growing appreciation within Belarus of the need for democracy; hence the need for greater western contact with pro-@@ democracy parliamentarians to avoid the risk of self-imposed isolation@@ ism
Finally , if the people of Belarus so wish , we must also offer them the prospect of possible EU membership in the longer term
Mr President , I have nothing extensive or substantive to add to what I said in my introductory remarks
We will want to pursue those points vigorously
I hope that there will be sufficient change in Belarus for us to develop a warm@@ er relationship with that important country
However , to borrow a sporting metaphor , the ball is in the Belarus Government 's court
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at 12 noon
The next item is the vote
My report also ed@@ its the text so that it is gender neutral , in recognition of the fact that many women have entered the seaf@@ aring profession over recent years
The report therefore proposes that short group visas should be issued to groups of between five and fifty seamen , even if they are not all of the same nationality
This will help European shipping considerably
Mr President , there should be no problem at all in banning E 4@@ 25 k@@ on@@ j@@ a@@ c
It is a completely unnecessary additive which , moreover , is dangerous
What , above all , we are concerned with here are soft drinks , sweets and the like which children consume in larger quantities than is desirable
This is , then , a question for the Commission
I shall respond directly to the point she made
I can confirm that the review of authorised food additives is required in the overall framework directive and in the three specific directives on the various classes of additives
The framework directive requires food additives to be re-@@ evaluated whenever necessary
The specific directives require Member States to monitor the consumption of food additives and the Commission to use this information to report to Parliament and to the Council
The Commission presented a first report two years ago in 2001
I want to underline the point that it covered consumption of food additives by adults and children
It has identified additives on which more refined data is necessary
In particular , it concluded that consumption by children of a series of additives should be better evaluated by the Member States , for example , sulph@@ ites and ben@@ zo@@ ates
A second report is foreseen next year in 2004
Last October , the Commission formally reminded the Member States of their obligation to provide the information for this new report
Three Member States have since then transmitted information and four Member States have confirmed that they have ongoing studies
I hope that those reassurances will meet the very important points made by the rapporteur
Does the rapporteur wish to maintain the advice she gave before she asked the question to the Commission ?
Mr President , my voting machine is making a very strange noise and it has a lot of lights on it
We will take note of what we can now call ' the McNally precedent ' , in other words , a noisy machine
Mr President , there are , very conf@@ us@@ ingly , a large number of translations of item 14
It is apparent from its context that it is about the United Nations rather than the United States , and that must be made clear
That has to be borne in mind , and it is perhaps important as we come to the vote
We will take note of your comments and ensure that all language versions correspond
Mr President , I have tabled Amendment No 6 which will become null and void if Amendment No 3 is voted for
The voting list shows that Amendment No 3 should be voted first
We have had a suggestion that there should be a split vote instead
I ask for the rapporteur 's advice on this matter
Mr President , Amendment No 3 has not been lodged with the Committee on Foreign Affairs , Human Rights , Common Security and Defence Policy
One amendment only has been lodged with that committee , namely Amendment No 6
We have valid amendments before us , the first of which is Amendment No 3
You have called for a split vote and the rapporteur said he would be in favour of this
Is that correct ?
Mr President , my proposal is firstly Amendment No 3 and then later Amendment No 6
And if there is an Amendment No 6 , a separate vote
So , if we vote for Amendment No 3 then Amendment No 6 falls
Those who would like to vote for Amendment No 6 now know what the consequences will be
That concludes the vote
That would be too simple , however , for the generations of self-@@ sty@@ led ' fathers of Europe '
Hence , a number of measures to make it easier to obtain certain categories of visa
This initiative is intended to update , clarify and streamline rules for granting visas to seamen in transit
They must not be required to have the same nationality , however , because in practical terms , this would basically nulli@@ fy the effects of this proposal
It is also important to make the shipping agent and the shipping line responsible for visa requests
I voted in favour of this report for two main reasons
Furthermore , I also share the rapporteur 's conviction about the importance of controlling external borders as a means of combating illegal immigration and crime
' Why do you not let me move throughout Europe in your report ? '
' replied Mr Santini
'@@ But you can move throughout Europe
I am Pan@@ tal@@ one , I am poor , I have no money , and so I cannot move throughout Europe
I am not happy about this , and so I advise Mr Fatuzzo to vote against the motion
And I did , in fact , vote against the motion
You can take it up with Mr Santini over lunch
The reason why I am giving this explanation of vote is that we may well find ourselves having to define our position anew at Second Reading stage
Mr President , the majority of British Labour Members , myself included , have abstained on the Santini report
We do not , for example , accept the need to do away with documentary evidence proving family relationship
Moreover , there must be safeguards to ensure that we do not encourage the use of marriage as an avenue to gain illegal entry
The provisions which seek to soften the economic conditions attached to residence in exceptional circumstances need more work and clarification before a further reading
Finally , we do not accept the provision in Article 26 which would prevent Member States from expe@@ lling permanent residents in exceptional circumstances
This power is rarely used , but we must reserve the right to use it for serious breaches of public security
The motion to allow European citizens freedom of movement and residence on Community territory is on the right track , which is why I support it
It gives citizens greater opportunity to exercise their right to move freely throughout the Community by calling for procedures to be simplified and pared down
Of course , making over six months ' residence dependent on financial resources could give rise to social discrimination
This text would take power away from the Member States and make them lose a little more of the control of their territory , which we refuse to accept
On these grounds , we voted against this text
Even in the proposal for a directive , this right is partial and its limits carefully defined
For example , it will be the responsibility of the Member State of residence to determine whether or not it intends to provide social aid or student grants
This , however , does not prevent us from constantly talking about European citizenship
For stays of more than six months , if a Union citizen is engaged in a g@@ ain@@ ful activity , he is simply required to make a declaration to that effect
If he is not engaged in a g@@ ain@@ ful activity , he is obliged to declare that he has sufficient resources and Member States may not fix any threshold for this
He must also take out sickness insurance cover for his first four years of residence
The report makes some positive improvements , widening the concept of the family , eliminating or simplifying some bureaucracy , and guaranteeing more rights than those planned initially
Basically , we think that the Commission 's proposal is too far-reaching in as much as a Member State would not be able to de@@ port people with permanent residence permits
The European Union has succeeded in one aspect
Virtually nobody believes that there are still rules which seriously restrict that right
We are constantly arguing for greater mobility of labour , which would entail Europeans , like Americans , being willing to move thousands of kilometres for paid work
I am voting for this regulation because it reduces existing restrictions and excludes the expulsion of people on account of illness or an accident
My position is not rooted in any type of ideological or religious fundamentalism
I am not judging , and nor is it my place to judge anyone 's rights on the grounds of their sexual or any other kind of orientation
Apart from anything , such definitions will encourage all sorts of abuses by those who attempt illegally to move to the EU and settle
The European Parliament has therefore opted for what is a clearly excessive approach , which goes far beyond what is needed
This will , in a counterproductive way , only create further difficulties and new unnecessary obstacles to the adoption of these rules
As I have already said , those who wish to achieve too much will prevent us from achieving the basic goals
The conditions governing freedom of movement and residence within the EU for persons without EU citizenship must be clear and simple to apply legally
Mr President , just after seeing the Italian theat@@ r@@ ical character , Pan@@ tal@@ one , who advised me how to vote on the Santini report , I saw a Ma@@ fi@@ o@@ so
Now you are discussing the Hernández Mollar report which seeks to prevent us Ma@@ fi@@ o@@ si from moving freely throughout Europe
I have to tell you , Mr Fatuzzo , that I like listening to your explanations of vote
Vis@@ as are necessary and useful tools in providing controls
Vis@@ as are a way for governments to tor@@ ment people
We can find out what obstacles we are subjecting other people to by looking at the experiences of EU citizens travelling through Serbia or Belarus
The first lesson is that you must not make people queue at a customs office or outside one to pay transit tax
The second lesson is that you must never send people back to a distant embassy in a capital city or even in their country of origin to get a visa
If we turn people away we must have a good reason for doing so
If we do admit people , we must not only do so because we hope that companies in our countries can do business with them
A visa policy must be reasonable , also for students , tourists and people who are coming to present their problems to international organisations
According to information that has been provided , many Ecu@@ ad@@ ore@@ ans enter Europe legally under the cover of tourism but then stay on illegally for longer than three months
I am voting in favour of this report , primarily because it is a further demonstration that East Timor is recognised as a fully-fledged State
The Ecu@@ ad@@ orian Government 's concern at the legislative change we are discussing is understandable , but we cannot minimise the dissuasive effect that experience has proved necessary to step up
I would like , if I may , Mr President , to address the Belar@@ u@@ sian Head of State
I would like to propose to you a method which is used here in some European States when they can no longer pay pensions
In Italy , for example , a law is passed stating that a certain category of citizens will no longer receive pensions
So why are you paying pensions late , Mr Lukashenko ?
Pass a law - you have the authority to do it - suppressing a large proportion of pensions in Belarus
That way , you will be able to do legally what is currently perceived to be just poor administration on your part
Belarus has cut itself off from the international community because of the autocratic policy followed by its regime
The Belar@@ u@@ sian regime is clearly a dictatorship riddled with corruption , which op@@ presses its people
Furthermore , the report compares an undemocratic Belarus with a Russia that is portrayed as democratic
In view of this , there is no question of our supporting this text
There is a problem in Belarus with respect for human rights and democratic freedoms
However , this is a matter for its own people and does not warrant foreign intervention
That concludes the explanations of vote
( The sitting was suspended at 12
and resumed at 3 p
He is in a sense - if this is not regarded as bl@@ as@@ phem@@ ous - the John the B@@ ap@@ tist for this agreement
We have both had the pleasure in the past of addressing conferences on this subject , speaking on this subject in Santiago and elsewhere
It is extremely important to recognise the role that he and other Members have played in this important and happy occasion
We are considering today a very important proposal on the adoption of the Association Agreement that we signed with Chile in November last year
This agreement is not only crucial for European Union-@@ Chile relations , it is also extremely important in the context of Latin America as a whole
It is more important than ever for us to send a positive signal of support to the region - from the European Union to Latin America
Parliament has played an active and supportive role throughout the negotiation of this agreement
I am pleased to note that the Commission met this objective and managed to negotiate a very ambitious agreement
We worked very closely with the Spanish presidency in the first sem@@ est@@ er of last year to achieve this , and it was a very important step forward
Chile , as we know , is a constructive player on the international stage and endorses the same values and policies that we defend in the European Union
For example , it is not surprising that last year Chile ratified the Kyoto Protocol
There are many other examples
We certainly want to deepen the political dialogue with Chile and to define converging positions on issues of common interest
I am pleased that Chile is keen on closer political relations with the European Union
This is shown in the almost unanimous support that the Chilean Congress gave to the agreement in January , less than two months after the agreement was signed in Brussels
5 % and which should contribute to raising the standard of living of the Chilean people
The European Union has been for a long time Chile 's first trade partn@@ er; this agreement should further consolidate and increase our trade relations
The agreement should allow us to overcome obstacles and to build an operating framework for entrepreneurs which allows more predictability , confidence and bigger trade flows
The bulk of the trade chapter entered into force on 1 Fe@@ br@@ u@@ ar@@ y; I trust that entrepreneurs and consumers on both sides will soon reap the benefits of the agreement
Let me say a final word about the institutional framework of this association agreement
I hope that honourable Members of this Parliament will participate actively in this committee
Judging by the enthusiasm with which they have pressed us to make this agreement , that should be no problem
Once again , I would like to thank Parliament for the leadership it has shown in this issue
I am sure the beneficiaries will be not only the people of the European Union and Chile but also the overall relationship with such an important and dynamic continent
Commissioner Patten asked us to trust in his judgment in order to overcome the problems relating to the timetable and he has been proved right
An agreement which has been described by the Commission - correctly I believe - as an agreement for the twenty-first century , a fourth generation plus agreement
This agreement is very rich in terms of commercial liberalisation
I believe that this agreement completes the network of agreements being negotiated at the moment
I would like to thank all the political groups for their positive and constructive cooperation in the issuing of this favourable opinion on the association agreement
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to start with warm congratulations to the rapporteur , Mr Salafranca
It is in our interests to maintain this stability and help to make it even more secure
My principal interest is in the political dimension , and there are two points I would like to address at this point
We attach great importance to Chile 's ratification of this treaty
The second point is that Chile is currently a member of the Security Council
The agreement also offers great possibilities in the fields of services and financial services , as well as on all aspects relating to investments
It is also positive that it includes a protocol on fishing enterprises
I have read the report of the International Human Rights Federation on the indigenous populations in Chile
4 % of the total population , or 13 % , depending on the source of statistics
Of these populations , the M@@ ap@@ uc@@ he people , in percentage terms , are the most significant
The problems of the indigenous population relate to forest exploitation and the construction of large hydro@@ -@@ electric projects
We must remember that these problems were exacerbated enormously during the dictatorship of Pinochet
We are glad that the report contains explicit references to the protection of human rights and specifically mentions the rights of indigenous minorities
We hope that this Agreement will create greater transparency and mutual understanding , and that it will also recognise the rights of the indigenous peoples
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the EU/@@ Chile Association Agreement en@@ acts particularly ambitious , strengthened cooperation
Furthermore , we feel this far-reaching agreement has taken place too quickly , in particular given the impact assessment un@@ veiled at the same time
It is a shame that the impact assessment did not really act as a basis for this association agreement
Following Chile 's dark history , all our vigilance should be focused on political rights , in particular the fate of the M@@ ap@@ uc@@ he Indians
Let us spare the Chilean fishermen the overexploitation of their resources that has destroyed our own European marine resources
In particular , let us spare Chile from being relegated to the role of er@@ sat@@ z fish@@ mon@@ ger for our Community ports
Lastly , we think the scope of this agreement should have given rise to a prior discussion of the same magnitude
This agreement , which aspires to be a model for the twenty-first century , is being dealt with too cur@@ s@@ orily
We submitted an oral question in this regard to allow a debate worthy of the agreement , but the proposal was dismissed
Cl@@ assed as a four@@ th-@@ generation agreement , it should even , we are told , constitute a model for future association agreements with the other Latin American countries
These grandiose perspectives are , however , more cause for concern than for celebration
They play a role similar to locks in a waterways system , allowing regular@@ isation between countries with differing standards of living
Many of our industries have already paid the cost of customs disarmament
The World Trade Organisation agreements , accepted by Brussels , thus forced them to de@@ loc@@ alise production in order to counter competition
Enlargement to the East , which has been decided in haste , will aggravate this phenomenon
The four@@ th-@@ generation agreement extended to all of Latin America will make millions more men and women unemployed
In the political domain , it is common to wa@@ x l@@ yr@@ ical about the creation of a transatlantic Euro-@@ Lat@@ in-@@ American assembly
Having built a bureaucratic super-State in Brussels , having swallowed up an Eastern Europe that has only just escaped the Soviet empire , the Euro-@@ federalists are still not satisfied
In a kind of political glu@@ t@@ ton@@ y , they want to integrate into their economic plans not only Turkey and Asia minor but the whole of Latin America as well
Of course , there is still natural solidarity between our nations and those of Latin America
Mr President , I just wanted to tell Mr Lan@@ g that opening itself up to world markets has paid off for Chile
What I would like to say to Commissioner Patten is that we are already engaged in active cooperation with members of Chile 's parliament
The problem we now have is not with the treaty
The treaty is excellent , and I also wish to congratulate Mr Salafranca on his super@@ lative report
There is a treaty , but it must not be allowed to remain an empty form of words
It has to be filled out - with something real
Let me , by the way , remind you of the fact that we also have a scientific agreement with Chile
If that is not to remain a mere formality , it too has to be filled out , and that is what I want to urge us to do
Money is needed if that is to be done , but money is not the most important thing
Mr President , most of the previous speakers have sun@@ g the praises of this agreement , first and foremost the rapporteur
I would like to be able to add my voice to this almost unanimous cho@@ ir , but I must admit to being perplexed
Will they be able to surf the Internet or travel if they wish to ?
There is one people , in any case , that shares my doubts , and that is the M@@ ap@@ uc@@ he people
First of all , the Chilean Government has not yet ratified International Labour Organisation Convention 169 on indigenous peoples
Many arbitrary acts of violence committed by the police against the indigenous communities go unpunished
Lastly , I am not convinced that the wholesale liberalism of the agreement allows for harmonious development of the economies of this State
Economic and monetary dependency might lead to the ' Argentin@@ isation ' of the country
Those are the risks and those are my doubts
I shall abstain from voting on this agreement
Mr President , one thing that has not been mentioned during this debate is the fisheries protocol which has been attached to this agreement
The effect of this fisheries protocol is that EU-@@ subsidised companies will now be allowed to invest in Chile with up to 100 % ownership rights
It will allow them direct access to Chilean fish stocks
We have only to look at the Argentin@@ ean case
EU companies will be able to buy up Chilean fish quotas on fully exploited fish stock@@ s; they will also have free access rights to Chile 's under-@@ exploited fisheries resources
The opportunities provided by this protocol for EU fisheries companies , combined with the process of privatisation in Chilean fisheries , threaten the sustainability of the ar@@ tisanal fisheries sector
The protocol will be used to transfer part of the EU 's overcapacity to Chilean waters
I am fed up with this irresponsible and exploitative approach to the problems of overcapacity of EU vessels
Is it any coincidence that this protocol was attached during the Spanish presidency and forced through ?
The ar@@ tisanal fisheries contribute over 90 % of fish consumed locally and provide 25 % of export earnings for the fisheries market
So it is unacceptable that this aspect has not been properly assessed and taken into account
Mr President , this debate has been slightly livelier than some of us might have anticipated
Speaking for the bureaucratic superstate , I should like to respond firstly to Mr Sakellariou on the important point which he raised about the International Criminal Court
He will know that Chile participated actively in the preparatory work on the Statute of the International Criminal Court
That court indicated that it was necessary to modify the Chilean constitution before approving the Treaty
Since modifying the constitution is a lengthy procedure , as it requires a two-thirds majority in Congress , the Treaty cannot yet be ratified
If there is one country which should understand the arguments for the International Criminal Court , as the honourable Member and I would agree , it is Chile
There is Article 19 of the Treaty and there is the Maastricht Treaty , but perhaps I should not be drawn down these b@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ards
In any case , I am using what he said about Chile merely as a trigger to fire off some of my thoughts on this subject
Several honourable Members raised the question of indigenous peoples , which is always a particularly important issue on these occasions
Difficul@@ t as these issues are , the Chilean Government is trying to handle them in a sensitive and democratic way
They have set up a public agency to try to handle some of these challenges
They have taken at least 16 concrete measures to help deal with some of the problems , of which Members have been informed
There is the protocol , which has been referred to
Community fishing companies will be allowed to own up to 100 % of Chilean fishing companies
However , that is under exactly the same conditions as Chilean investors
That implies that they will have to respect , for example , the catch quotas defined in Chilean laws
It is not right to say that the implementation of the agreement will lead to over-exploitation of fishing resources
The current dynamism of the ar@@ tisanal fishing sector in Chile is something all of us should recognise , and it needs to be underlined in debating these matters
This sector is the main supplier of seafood products to the domestic fresh fish market
It currently provides 25 % of export income from fisheries products
Without any reservation whatsoever , I commend this agreement to the Chamber
I am sure that the Vice-President of the Commission would also warmly endorse all that we are trying to achieve with this important agreement
Once again , I wish to thank Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra and his colleagues , Mr Linkohr and others , who have taken such an active interest in this matter
This is a model of this sort of agreement
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this proposal was presented on 20 December 2001 in order to respond to the request of the European Council in Laeken
However , the Commission does not believe that the system of ecopoints is a valid long-term system for resolving the problems of traffic associated with sensitive regions
On the other hand , the proposal maintains the system in force throughout Austrian territory and also the number of ecopoints available for 2003
In fact , in 2003 the objective of the system will be achieved , which is to reduce pollution by 60 % over the last twelve years
In any case , before I go any further , I would like to say that , as a mountain@@ -@@ d@@ wel@@ ler , I fully understand the Austrians ' concerns
What should our strategy for transport be ?
The Austrian question relates to the Alps but the situation is similar in other mountain ranges such as the Pyrenees too
We are faced with a boom in freight transport , which will expand even further with enlargement
There is a need for a new policy based on the Swiss model
The committee of which I am Chairman has made every endeavour to find a balanced solution
We have consulted the Ministers
We have even had the date for the construction of the Brenner B@@ ase Tunnel brought forward definitively from 20@@ 21 to 2012
I can accept Amendment No 19 tabled by the Greens , which calls for further debate
Lastly , I feel we must reject Amendments Nos 20 and 21 because they too change the proposal completely
I will end , Mr President , by saying that , as Committee Chairman and rapporteur , it was my duty to find a balance
Mr President , the rapporteur 's coordinating work has enabled us to achieve a great deal of agreement in Parliament
A new regulation is being proposed to replace the old eco points system
It is not easy for anyone to arrive at a balanced solution for transit traffic through the Austrian Alps
The concerns about environmental pollution and public health are understandable
Geograph@@ ically speaking , Austria is , after all , a transit country , which is why we suggested excluding from the area the lorries that produce the most pollution
I think that this is one of the major advantages that Parliament 's proposal has over that of the Council and the Commission
If we promote cleaner lorries , transport companies will be encouraged to buy environmentally friendly vehicles
Cle@@ an@@ er lorries , the so-called EURO@@ -@@ 3 and EURO@@ -@@ 4 , are therefore not subject to the quota system but have free passage
The proposals of both the Commission and the Council do not promote the use of clean lorries in any way whatsoever
In fact they even go so far as to penalise the use of the clean EURO@@ -@@ 4 by reducing the number of points that will be available
It must also be crystal clear to all parties concerned that it will really be over after 2006
There can be absolutely no question of an extension or any other form of quota system
Austria 's unique position cannot continue , certainly not given the discriminatory nature of the old system
I have two urgent requests
do something from your side too , by increasing the number of trains and ensuring that they are cleaner
I am firmly convinced that my colleague Paul Rübig will agree with this support , which is also aimed at smaller and medium-sized transport companies
My unease , Mr President , is also due to the great contradiction which this ecopoints system represents without resolving the issue which Commissioner de Palacio also mentioned
This is not the case
It is an unacceptable simplification of the facts
I will end , Mr President , by reminding myself that , in extending the ecopoints system , we are not adopting it as a solution but postponing the decision
Now the governments must have their say
Mr President , today I would like to argue for the Dutch pol@@ der ecopoint , the Scottish High@@ land levy and the Spanish Pyrenees tax
I was therefore not enthusiastic when I heard that the Danish Presidency had succeeded in extending the system until 2006
France and Italy also have Alps , and the Pyrenees are also very vulnerable
My colleague Mr Ca@@ ver@@ i 's report managed to bring this unexpected extension of a bad system by the Council back down to reasonable proportions
The polluter must pay and the most environmentally friendly lorries must continue to be excluded from the full impact of the ecopoints
If Austria seriously wants to tackle transit traffic that poll@@ utes the environment , she will have to invest in infrastructure , invest in railways , and invest in tunnels
P@@ assing the buck by pleading for a stricter ecopoint system seems to me not to be acting in solidarity with neighbouring countries
It would just create extra traffic in these countries , with too little benefit to the European environment , as traffic would have to make det@@ ours
I am fervently hoping for a good result in the voting tomorrow
Austria would probably like to do the same for north-south traffic , but membership of the European Union puts obstacles in the way of this
German and Italian road transport operators would prefer to have a free passage , as would the Dutch operators that are strongly represented in the sector
When Austria joined the European Union , a compromise was reached on a distribution arrangement
Since then , the country has been put under pressure to allow more and larger lorries through
This is not merely a problem for Austria alon@@ e; the whole of the Alps - a sensitive area - is also at stake
This is where I disagree with Mr Ver@@ me@@ er
We should not be playing off the free movement of goods against the balance of the ecosystem
I agree with Mr Ca@@ ver@@ i that this is a problem for the whole of Europe , and so it is Europe that must make an attempt at resolving it
Austria cannot solve on its own something that is a problem for the zone as a whole
Opinions can differ when it comes to the ecopoints
They were an instrument
Austria is open to accusations of not having done its homework , of not having found or even sought out allies
It may have been too cautious in what it did , in that rail capacity was not fully utilised
We are waiting for a proposal from Europe
Nor do we know whether there are measures specific to the sensitive areas in the Alps , or whether there are specific measures for sensitive zones in Europe
Without an upper limit , it will not work
Lim@@ ited and transitional solutions are not what we want
We need an effective solution until such time - the sooner , the better - as a directive on transport infrastructure costs enters into force
That would earn us the gratitude of all the Europeans who live in these regions
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Austria is seriously testing Mr Jarzembowski 's end@@ ur@@ ance today , but I cra@@ ve his indulgence
Ladies and gentlemen , crucial Austrian interests are at stake when we vote on the extension of the ecopoint system
The objective , as formulated in the Transit Agreement , of a long-term and sustainable reduction in pollutants has not , as yet , been achieved
In parts of the country from which I come , transit traffic has come to constitute an intolerable nuisance
The proposals in Mr Ca@@ ver@@ i 's report reduce the ecopoint system to an empty shell
Even though I do not think this proposal goes far enough , it represents a middle way acceptable to all parties involved
Austria does not simply want to keep its ecopoint system well into the distant future
Just as we did then , we see the Transit Regulation as a sort of leading issue
We regard these concerns of ours as being in harmony with the Commission 's objectives as regards transport
We want all those things , too
That is why it is so important that no gap should be allowed to occur between the expiry of the transit regime and the new directive entering into force
That is also why we need an appropriate transitional regime
The environment , and the people who live in the affected areas , will thank us for it
Here and now , we say in the clearest terms that what we need is a transitional regulation
Railways are not being used to their fullest capacity
The simple fact is that , so long as there is no proper system of tolls , they are too expensive
There is one Member who has given it as his opinion that it is unfair to impose conditions applicable only to Austria
I can already see the amendments to the next Izquierdo Collado report , in which a commitment will be made to cross-@@ financing - at least in principle
This leads me to believe that we should not only be doing united lip-service to sustainable development , but should also be creating the instruments for it
We know all too well that an environmentally-@@ focussed transport policy is one of the essential instruments for bringing about sustainable development in Europe
It makes no mention of the people of Austria and the Alpine region
Whether or not they were on top of the world plays no part whatsoever in this song , but it does in this report
This report ep@@ it@@ om@@ ises European transport policy
Its significance goes beyond Austria and even the Alpine region as a whole
It is a tool in the hands of sustainable development in European transport policy
No time vacuum should arise as regards this protection
There must also be some restriction of the number of lorries passing through the Alps
Without a clear target , there is little point to all of this
We are therefore calling for the imposition of a permanent 8 % limit on growth compared to the figure for 1991
We are unable to endorse this report until a solution is found in the medium term for the Alpine region as a whole
That is primary legislation enacted by Austria and the EU
Instead , there has been a massive rise in the number of transit journeys , and the nuisance from pollution has increased by 52 % in comparison to 1992
The ecopoint regulation will lapse at the end of 2003 , even though its objective , the sustainable reduction of these pollutants , has not been achieved
This agreement must guarantee that there will be no further increase in emissions from transit traffic over against the 2003 levels
Adoption of this report would have the opposite effect , that is , a dramatic increase in the levels of emissions from transit traffic
Secondly , the report entirely ignores the opinion of the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , which that body adopted by a large majority
Thirdly , it goes counter to the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol and of the Alpine Convention , as well as to the European Union 's environmental goals in general
It is the primary task of the European Parliament to defend the interests of Europe 's citizens
Mr President , I cannot understand my Austrian colleagues
After all , they should be satisfied with the way in which the Ca@@ ver@@ i report gives them another sensible transitional regulation
I will remind the honourable gentleman and the honourable ladies that this is a special case , and a quite unjustified one at that
Do you imagine we do not get transit traffic in the north of Germany ?
Do you imagine that other parts of Germany , or of Belgium do not suffer from it ?
What you are after is special treatment
In no way can you justify that
Excuse me , my good sir , but why do not you behave like a parliamentarian for a change ?
This is not just about the Austrians ' unilateral rights; the other 360 million citizens are also entitled to see Community law adhered to
The great thing about the Ca@@ ver@@ i report is that in it , we are proposing that there should again be a three-year transitional arrangement for the Alpine region
That shows that we are meeting your people and their interests halfway
Ladies and gentlemen , that is intolerable
The Ca@@ ver@@ i report proposed a sound compromise between the interests of 360 million citizens of the EU and those of fewer than 10 million other EU citizens
That has to be weighed in the balance
I believe that the Ca@@ ver@@ i report ends up making you a good offer , in the form of a transitional arrangement
You kept on wanting cross-subsidies
Those are the facts of the matter
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for his patience and determination
I therefore fully support and endorse this approach , to which we contributed , moreover
However , quite frankly , there is something I must say in conclusion to the Austrian Members
We will not find a European solution by accentu@@ ating the problems
We too could have taken up a stance and refused to bud@@ ge on this matter but we decided to adopt a more reasonable approach instead
I feel that , for the good of Europe , your attitude should be more tempered and more conciliatory
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , much has been said already , and I can keep my speech relatively brief
Firstly , Parliament accepts that Austria is entitled to have a derogation extended
That is something of which we must not lose sight
I warn , though , that we must not now start attaching a very high value to one section of the human race and a lower one to others
This has nothing to do with crossing the Alps or with eco@@ log@@ y; it is because they would be liable to ecopoints if they went via the au@@ tob@@ ah@@ n
Having traffic doing such things as taking det@@ ours or going elsewhere altogether is just not on
Only 11 % of HGV traffic in Austria is liable to ecopoints
These are not t@@ all stories
I have had such conversations
After all , I live there and have contacts there
I cannot accept that a certain segment of Europe 's population is being treated as being worth more
It cannot , though , be one of Europe 's tasks to step in for the benefit of one region 's economic interests
We will make no progress at all
I believe that the solution adopted , once again as a transitional measure , by the Ca@@ ver@@ i report is the best solution possible under the given circumstances
The fact is that journeys undertaken by HGVs travelling through Austrian territory have gone up by 50 %
The fact is that in not one of the years since the Treaty was signed has any traffic been transferred from road to rail
On the contrary , the tonnage on the road over the Brenner has increased from 15 million tonnes of freight to 26 million
That amounts to an increase of 73 %
The people living along the transit routes are in despair
Many of them are farmers whose families have lived on their farms for centuries
It is not a matter of them being given a higher value , but they do live higher up
I beg you not to rob these people of their last hope
My dear Geor@@ g , the ecopoint system was always , in essence , a compromise
I saw the Council 's New Year 's E@@ ve resolution as the very last chance for us to find a common way ahead
It goes without saying that , in Austria too , there are groups trying to get their justified demands incorporated into policy
I beg you , I bese@@ ech you , to reject the Ca@@ ver@@ i report and adopt the Danish presidency 's compromise proposal
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to the Commissioner
Mr President , Commissioner , the proposal before us for our consideration has to do with the extension of the ecopoint system applicable to lorries travelling through Austria
The first thing I want to say is that derogations are justified in the Alps , which are a sensitive region
Secondly , the system of ecopoints must definitely come to an end in 2006
Thirdly , the state of technological development means that HGVs in emission categories 3 and 4 should lose their ecopoint liability altogether
Indeed , what happens to one pass immediately affects all the others
As far as the Brenner tunnel is concerned , recent progress has been sp@@ as@@ modi@@ c , to say the least
I have therefore reached the conclusion that the solution proposed by the Ca@@ ver@@ i report is fair
There are a range of interests , all of them legitimate but entirely contradictory , which are in opposition to each other
I would simply like to point out to certain Members that we need a quick resolution , because the current transitional situation ends on 31 December 2003
Secondly , the current situation is transitional
In other words , what appears in the accession Treaty , the protocol on which the whole system of ecopoints is based , lays down a limited time period
It is therefore a transitional exception which must be based , in principle , on the current system because for two or three years it would not make much sense
In Mr Ca@@ ver@@ i 's proposal there are points which take the same approach as the principle for agreement proposed by the Danish Presidency on 31 December
However , while I understand this in principle , it would create enormous difficulties in terms of managing the project
I would therefore ask that the general area of Austria be maintained
Furthermore , in the Council we have debated whether or not to exclude the H@@ ör@@ bran@@ z Pass , the L@@ ind@@ au@@ -@@ St
Mar@@ g@@ are@@ then , which involves a stretch of road of less than 15 kilometres , a very short distance
That would also raise problems
I would therefore ask you not to retain this part , please
The provisions of the system of conting@@ ents , which vary according to categories , would also raise difficulties
Furthermore , the number of ecopoints set relates to the current Member States , and to apply the system now to the future countries would complicate matters even further
Let us hope that before they join as full Members this problem has been resolved definitively
Furthermore , that clause did not appear in the proposal
I would like to say to you that the real solution is to build the Brenner , to build the L@@ y@@ on-@@ Turin , that intermodality truly be established
Those are the solutions
You must understand that we have to seek a compromise and that a solution is urgently required
We do not have many months
And the perfect is always the enemy of the good
I say this to everyone
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
At the moment these approxim@@ ations are still taking place , and I would urge that we reach a thorough consensus for the vote tomorrow
We have used this time to inform the sectors and allow them to participate
Commissioner , in this case Parliament is not opposing the Commission
W are continuing this reflection , however , and providing certain constructive criticisms and specific proposals which should be analysed by the Commission as appropriate
This is a crucial and decisive time for transport
It is true that in 1992 , in the last White Paper on Transport , certain objectives were set which have been fulfilled practically in their entirety
As well as the actual environmental aspect , congestion is worrying
And therefore competitiveness is being seriously harmed
Char@@ ging is a rough diamond in the White Paper which we must be able to cut from now on and which is essential
The essential role of roads must be respected and valued , the railways must be liberalised , short - and medium-@@ distance c@@ abot@@ age must be strengthened , etc
Safety cannot be conditional
You have cooperated in the White Paper in this respect and Parliament wishes to follow
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would firstly like to thank Mr Izquierdo Collado for the work he has done over a long period
I believe his work has allowed us to hold the sometimes passionate debates which have resulted from the White Paper
The analysis we have presented in the White Paper has been debated in depth , also by the industry and the sectors mostly affected
In this regard , most of the measures proposed in the White Paper have been presented by the Commission to this Parliament and to the Council
With regard to the second rail package , the negotiations are at a very advanced stage and this Parliament expressed its opinion very clearly just a couple of months ago
However , other important proposals are still at a preparatory stage , such as the trans-European networks
It should therefore also be discussed by this Parliament
Secondly , a system for incenti@@ vising public-private partnerships in the creation of infrastructures
The Commission has just adopted a proposal for a directive on the safety of tunnels and we will shortly present a global action plan in the field of road safety
In this field , we will also present important proposals on the control of road transport in relation to the identification of motorway black spots
Ladies and gentlemen , I have seen the proposals made by the rapporteur , in general terms , though I will discuss the different points in more detail later
I believe we are working in the same spirit
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the subject for debate here is not simply a report on the transport of the future
This is , in fact , one of the last ways out following a generation of production and mobility that has burnt itself out
There is nothing we can do now other than try to curb the existing phenomena of environmental crisis
The threats to our lifestyle are forcing us to instigate a genuine revolution in transport culture
We have certainly realised this rather late , but now we are , at last , able to separate increases in transport volume from economic growth
Increasing urbanisation must go hand in hand with improving public transport
For each new project , opportunities for intermodal connections between networks that already exist or are planned should be prioritised
Furthermore , we must not oppose this new deal on transport in 2010 with financial qui@@ bbling
An ambitious Community research and development programme must be carried out to counter noise pollution and harmful emissions in the transport sector and achieve the objectives of the Kyoto protocol
In its report , the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy raised the issue of the impact of these kinds of pollution on human health
A@@ lar@@ m bells are ringing everywhere , but that is no reason to simply announce that disaster is looming and cannot be averted
We have progressed from realisation to warnings
Otherwise we are heading for a fall , with full knowledge of the facts
Ladies and gentlemen , I now declare this debate suspended
We will resume it at 9 p
The next item is the communication from the Commission on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective to take account of enlargement
Commissioner Schreyer has the floor
It also made it possible to conclude negotiations on the financial package , which is not entirely straightforward
With effect from their accession , starting in May 2004 , the new Member States will be able to participate in all the support programmes funded by the European Budget
Invol@@ vement in market measures will facilitate the promotion of agriculture
Farmers will receive direct grants in aid , and the aid will be particularly important to farmers with small farms
And , of course , progressively more and more staff from the new Member States will be working in and for the European Union in Brussels and Luxembourg
the so-called Schengen facility , intended to co-finance controls at the external borders
Financial planning will need to be adjusted in order to anchor these items of expenditure in the Budget
What resulted from the Copenhagen negotiations was a balanced compromise between different interests
The financial framework for enlargement remains within the framework fixed in 1999 by the Inter-@@ institutional Agreement for the period 2000-2006
Today , the Commission adopted its proposal for the adjustment of the Financial Perspective
In it , the results of the Copenhagen negotiations are allotted to the individual headings
At the same time , the Financial Perspective is adjusted in line with the prices current in 2004
To put it another way , the upper limits are being reduced by EUR 1
At the heart of this , ladies and gentlemen , is the Commission 's proposal relating to the category of pre-accession aid , category 7
We will shortly be presenting a proposal for a considerable increase in the aid given to Turkey
I believe it to be in the common interest of the European Union that efforts at reform be strongly supported by resources for pre-accession aid
A new category has to be created in the Financial Perspective for entering free-@@ standing financial aid , the so-called lump sum transfers agreed on in Copenhagen , into future Budgets
In future , the Budget for the 2@@ 5-@@ Member European Union will no longer make any distinction between new and old Member States
12 % of gross national income - equivalent to EUR 115 billion - in commitment appropriations and 1
0@@ 8 % - that is to say EUR 111 billion - in payment appropriations
We now have an opportunity for the Members present to put brief and precise questions as described in Rule 38
We will follow the so-called catch the eye procedure
That is always rather tricky if the President is short-sighted , but , as most of the usual suspects are present , it should work
That being so , your question relates to category 3 of the Financial Perspective , that of internal policies , including many individual programmes in support of the Lisbon process
According to the Copenhagen resolution and the Commission proposal , the increase for internal policies will amount , in 2004 , to a total of EUR 1
Mr President , this is really a debate for the initiated and we are using the twelfth language of the Community , the budget
In other words , the financial perspectives - the headings - may be greater than the budgetary sums approved in Copenhagen
Is this correct ?
It is again specified in the accession treaties that these are , as it were , the maximum amounts for the adjustment of the Financial Perspective
Mr President , to follow on from that , the figures that we have been given - the Copenhagen figures - are actually lower than the figures provided subsequently
Therefore , the Copenhagen figures could not have been maximum figures , since the figures that we have seen since are actually larger
I would like to have the Commissioner 's view of what will happen if the Council puts the Copenhagen figures into the accession treaties
As you know , we will be discussing this next week with the Presidency in Athens
But as a Parliament , we face the dilemma that the Council may put in these figures to make sure that we vote for the accession treaties
If that is the case , what about Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement and what role will Parliament have in re@@ negotiating or reass@@ essing the financial perspective ?
If the Council does that , how would the Commissioner assess the value of the financial perspective ?
Today , the Commission has also , at the same time , decided on the adjustment of the Financial Perspective in 2004 prices , so this results in a difference
Let me point out that we have also included Cyprus in one of the tables
The answer given to Mr Colom i Naval 's question obliges me to put a second one
Where , in fact , does the Commission stand ?
The procedure over the coming weeks will find the Commission also having to decide whose side it is on
Mr Böge , I cannot quite fa@@ thom what you mean by defective methods of calculation
In Copenhagen , there were lengthy negotiations rather than calculations
Figu@@ res were laid down for the internal policy areas as they were for the others , stating how much was allocated
Let me also reiterate that there will be new programmes in the internal policy areas , the Schengen facility being one example
None of the programmes that we have had in the 15-@@ Member EU can be compared with it
Even the programme specifically for supporting the decommissioning of atomic power stations is a new one
This is again stated in the Copenhagen resolutions
At that time the European Council stated that the Commission , in its proposal , had to take into account the table summarising the outcome of negotiations
We now know that the results of the negotiations were not easily achieved
The candidate countries , too , engaged in in-depth negotiations not only with regard to the amount to be spent , but also to the structure the expenditure should have
I think this is something we have to respect
This notwithstanding the fact that it would go against the overall thinking behind the modus operandi devised as long ago as 1999
You have announced your intention of creating a category of pre-accession aid that will , in future , include Bulgaria and Romania , and that aid will be increased
Are you now putting these countries on one and the same footing ?
It was also the limitation within which the Commission proposal was drafted and the negotiations with the candidate countries were held
This is something to which we will have to give very careful attention in our discussion in next week 's trilogue
Further to your question on the Balkans , I have this to say
As has , this year , emerged from many reports in the press , Croatia has decided to apply for membership of the EU
It is not for us , at present , to consider whether another state is to be included in category 7
I would like to ask you to answer the questions from the next two speakers together
Mr President , in Copenhagen categories 1 and 2 have been negotiated and in reality the internal and external policies have more or less been calculated
First of all , I should like to say that I , too , concur with what Mr Walter said
I have a question regarding heading 6 of the financial perspective
If I have understood correctly , you have not said anything about this
We are soon to be joined by ten countries , none of which is to be a member of the euro zone
Is the monetary reserve now no longer necessary , and what are the reasons for this ?
Mr President , I will take Mr Garriga Polledo 's question on heading 4 first
Once the accession countries are Member States it will no longer be necessary to make the relevant guarantees available in the budget
In other words , after enlargement the Guarantee Fund will have more scope to support loans to third countries
The debate is closed
The next item is Question Time
The following questions are addressed to the Commission
What conclusions does the Commission draw from this as regards competition law , particularly in the light of the agreements between the Commission and the FI@@ A ?
The FI@@ A explains how Form@@ ul@@ a 1 races can be organised in France and the United Kingdom , even though these two countries have banned sponsorship by the tobacco industry
The system developed by the various parties involved in Form@@ ul@@ a 1 rac@@ ing through the agreements submitted to the Commission will continue to apply
As regards the specific case of S@@ pa@@ -@@ Fran@@ cor@@ cham@@ ps , the Commission is ascertain@@ ing whether Community competition law has been respected
The directive seeks to eliminate these problems and approximate the provisions on the subject
We personally , by the way , are strongly in favour of the directive banning tobacco advertising
I would like to thank Mr Rod for his compli@@ mentary comments , which I do not believe require any further response from me
You see , although these products are legal , it is not permitted to advertise them
This is a very interesting question , to which I will give a response which can only be brief and general
It is therefore not possible to give a general respon@@ se; we would do so , if necessary , should specific circumstances arise
Victi@@ m of sex abuse banned from leaving the United Arab Em@@ ir@@ ates
According to French press reports , on 15 October 2002 the authorities of the United Arab Em@@ ir@@ ates banned T@@ ou@@ ria Ti@@ oul@@ i , a French citizen , from leaving the country
I want to make it absolutely clear that the Commission shares the honourable Member 's indignation at the circumstances surrounding the detention of Ms T@@ ou@@ ria Ti@@ oul@@ i
She is a French citizen of Moroccan extraction , who has been held against her will in Du@@ ba@@ i since 15 October 2002
I have read the papers myself and I can well understand why the honourable Member has raised this issue
The Commission is following developments extremely closely
It is up to the competent authorities of the Member State whose citizen is affected to take all the necessary steps to support that citizen 's cause
As far as the Commission knows , the French Government is doing everything possible to put an end to this unfortunate situation
The Commission is willing to lend its support should the French authorities consider it necessary and appropriate
I can assure the honourable Member that we are reacting in the way the situation dictates , and that we will keep it under review
Commissioner , I am partly satisfied with your re@@ pl@@ y; however , I was hoping that the Commission would use its authority to put pressure on the United Arab Em@@ ir@@ ates
It is the competence of the French Government to decide how to handle an issue like this
We stand ready to take any action within the European Union framework , if and when the French Government deems it appropriate
Since then the Commission has not presented any specific proposals within the framework of this programme
Can it give the reasons for such an unjustified delay ?
Does it have any specific timetable which it intends to implement in 2003 to initiate this programme ?
What are the principal orientations it wishes to give to this regional programme for women and what are the main needs it intends to meet ?
I am delighted that the honourable Member is with us; it gives me an opportunity to answer a question about which I am concerned
Let me turn to the honourable Member 's important question
The Commission recognises the importance of enhancing the role of women in economic life in the partner countries around the Mediterranean
That was why we welcomed and supported the meeting held in July 2001 on this subject under the Belgian presidency of the Council
As a result of that meeting , the Commission included , among others , a regional programme on this subject under the MEDA Regional Indic@@ ative Programme for 2002-@@ 2004
In the context of limited resources , the Commission has to make difficult choices among priorities
I get the impression that , once again , you have said nothing new
Perhaps this programme , with its delays and miserly budget , is just an afterthought in the overall endeavour ?
Do you believe that this commitment on the part of the Commission will suffice ?
I want to assure the honourable Member just how seriously we take this issue
It is not just a question of focusing on this programme
I am extremely keen , as we review our programmes for the future , to take on board the exceptionally important report which was recently produced by the UN@@ DP
yes , there were problems of governance and the rule of law
They have given us an important wake-up call to look at these issues more seriously
I can assure the honourable Member that I take them very seriously indeed and that the Commission takes them very seriously
We will begin the second part of this Question Time , during which Commissioner Solbes will be replying
Up@@ dated stability programme for Greece
The ratio of debt in Greece is one of the highest in the Community
It increased up until the middle of the 1990s , reaching a peak of over 110 % of GDP in 1996
This was the result of increasing budgetary imbalances and low growth in GDP
The debt still represents 107 % of GDP in 2001
No@@ table amongst those are the financial operations which do not affect the budgetary balance but the volume of debt
In fact , the high rate of adjustment of the volume of debt , which reached 7
Bearing in mind the new budgetary perspective arising from this review , the updated stability programme foresees a reduction in the debt ratio equivalent to 1
7 % in 2002 , forecasting an acceleration of this reduction after 2003 , with a reduction of approximately 0
In fact , from 2003 , the modification of the debt ratio will correspond better to the level of primary surplus
And how should any new factor , by which I mean the impact of a possible war with Iraq on GDP , be taken into consideration ?
My reply will be very quick
The strategy in the programme has clearly been drawn up without the assumption of a war in Iraq
The strategy naturally anticipates an increase in the primary surplus and , to put it another way , using growth potential essentially in order to reduce taxes
The problem of war is viewed in completely different terms
However , I believe it would be premature to consider at this point doing anything more in relation to this issue
2 billion from its profits , which naturally broadened the scope for reorganising the national budget
A similar transfer was made the previous year
The issue mentioned by the honourable Member was raised in the convergence report adopted by the Commission on 22 May 2002 and also in section 6
In the absence of such rules , there is no adequate guarantee of the independence of the Central Bank and particularly its financial independence
These articles apply both to the participating Member States and to the Member States with exceptions
I would thank the Commissioner for that answer
I should , however , like just one thing to be clarified in this connection
We are talking here about a total of SEK 40 billion over two years
I would ask you to confirm that this is a correct interpretation of what you have just said
I believe that I have tried to be relatively clear in my reply
That is my comment and that is the comment included in our report
There is clearly time for implementation until participation in the Monetary Union , but this updating is essential for participation in it
The essential point is to achieve financial independence , the key element for the independence of the institution
Very briefly , as you know , the decisions relating to the use of resources fall to each of the national authorities
The problem you raise goes a step further
It is the problem of public finances , where revenue should be used and what type of expenditure we should carry out
The fall in coffee prices is indeed catastrophic
What is the cause of this collapse ?
It is quite simply a considerable imbalance between supply and demand
It is a complex , multi-faceted issue
In the Commission , we already help , support and fund various actions in this field
We support , and I do so within the context of trade policy , projects aimed , for example , at the adoption of codes of conduct or social labels
In this way , if I may say so , we support all those who have invested in fair trade
We are trying to achieve better coordination of the various instruments available to us
For example , we began with the ' Everything but arms ' initiative , which allows a number of countries among the poorest in the world to diversify their exports
This is a policy that we have , if I may say so , supported and passed on , moreover , to various international organisations such as the World Bank
We are also working along these lines in applying the Cotonou Agreement
More simply , we are currently working with a number of NGOs and Oxfam , in particular
We have made contact with the main coffee merchants and we are in contact with a number of distributors
We are open to constructive ideas on this matter , which , I repeat , is complex
In any case , that is an example that should give pause for thought to those who advocate the total liberalisation of all agricultural markets
Mr President , I wish to thank Commissioner Lamy for his answer
I shall convey this to the NGO Inter@@ mon@@ -@@ Oxfam in the terms in which the Commissioner has expressed it to Parliament
Is the Commission aware that there is an ACP perception that , thus far , the EP@@ A negotiations have an inadequate development focus ?
What practical measures can be implemented which would be likely to convince the ACP that the objective of the negotiations is about more than just trade liberalisation ?
Mr President , Mrs Kinnock 's question concerns the progress of our negotiations with the African , Caribbean and Pacific countries on economic partnership agreements
These economic partnership agreements are part of an initial discussion stage
They logically follow what was agreed at Cotonou and we are trying to ensure that our ACP interlocutors reorganise themselves into sufficiently large groups to remedy the current situation
We must therefore change this
I would therefore reassure Mrs Kinnock on this point , if that is needed
It is not that businessmen hungry for access to extraordinarily attractive markets have taken control of these negotiations
The negotiations continue to follow the lines of what was agreed with Parliament and with the Council , in other words prioritising development
I will repeat , as many times as necessary , that the main objective of these agreements is not to open up the ACP markets further to Community products
These economic partnership agreements are not , to our minds , simply free-trade zones that are nothing more than instruments for trade
We have established various contacts with various ACP regions and we all know that some of them are more prepared to li@@ ase with us than others
As far as they are concerned , they have choices to make within the ACP group
We do not intend , and I do not intend , to make these choices for them
We shall li@@ ase with them when they are ready and those that are ready first will begin discussions with us when they decide to do so
Thank you Commissioner for acknowledging that you understand that there are these perceptions on the part of the ACP negotiators
That might be at the root of the kind of perception they have
The South Africans managed to get agreement that their trade negotiations would be ren@@ amed ' trade and development ' negotiations
That was a key element in the success of those negotiations
Would that not be an act of good faith with the ACP ?
There also seems to be resistance to making development an agenda item of the negotiations
Would you confirm whether this is , or is not , the case ?
In response to Mrs Kinnock , I think that feelings on the rhythm and perspectives of these agreements vary according to the regions we are talking to
I do not want to go into detail here , but I know some regions within the ACP group that are ready to start negotiations tomorrow
The objective of these negotiations must be sufficiently clear in their minds if this does not pose a problem for them
With regard to the title , I find ' economic partnership agreement ' perfectly appropriate
Is development the objective of these negotiations ?
Yes , of course , but development cannot be negotiated , whereas trade can
in particular , the ACP countries must work together to create markets that are large enough to interest investors
As the authors are not present , Question No 43 lapses
Re@@ quest from Thailand and the Philippines for preferential access to the EU for their can@@ ned tuna
If agreed and implemented by the EU , the recommendations will cause serious prejudice to the export of can@@ ned tuna of the ACP States and the Andean Pact countries
We undertook to hold discussions with Thailand and the Philippines and , if necessary , to enter into a mediation procedure
I repeat , to make this very clear , that , without this discus@@ sion@@ /@@ mediation procedure , the WTO derogation concerning the Cotonou Agreement would not have been obtained
We therefore went ahead with these discussions with Thailand and the Philippines in December 2001 , January last year and spring last year
They did not lead to an agreement
We all , therefore , asked the World Trade Organisation for mediation last autumn
The Commission is in favour of the adoption of these recommendations
We feel this is a matter of credibility and trust , and a way to manage our relations with a number of trade partners within the WTO mechanism
I am thinking in particular of a number of Latin American countries
This quota would represent approximately 9 % of total imports of can@@ ned tuna in the Union and 4 % of the total consumption of the Union
Community imports of can@@ ned tuna from the ACP countries have undergone a significant rise over the past few years
That is why we are supporting it and we have proposed the adoption of the mediator 's opinion in the Council of Ministers
Depending on the result of this consultation , we will shortly present a draft regulation to implement this quota
I should like to thank Commissioner Lamy for that full answer
I have three supplementary questions
In relation to that , he kindly invited me and others to his Conference on Im@@ pact Assessment last week
It was an extremely good conference , but a single statement will not have a major impact on the ACP
It will need some backing up
With Senegal responsible for 8 000 tonnes of imports and Ivory Coast 41 000 tonnes , the ACP believe they can be very seriously affected
In response to your three questions , Mr Howitt , I shall begin with the timetable
We are currently in contact with our Member States on a technical level
I believe we shall achieve the necessary qualified majority
If that were not the case , I would have to decide whether or not to take it further
That happens from time to time
It is a question of credibility for us
Everything took place transparently
That said , if any of the ACP countries wishes to discuss these technical aspects with us , we are fully prepared to do so
does this involve a derogation , a change from the market access commitments we made with regard to the ACP countries ?
This is not a change
It in no way alters the preferences
That is what is behind this matter , and we should all remember this in order to evaluate fairly the results that are on the table today
In assessing the impact of the proposal , it is also necessary to take into account the substantial degree of flexibility offered by the proposed directive
Exemp@@ tions from the principle of non-discrimination are possible
These include exemptions , for objective reasons , on the basis of collective agreements , and in cases of agency workers with open-ended contracts
These exemptions and derogations are particularly important given the current heterogeneity of the sector
The flexibility and diversity they offer make it impossible to come up with simplistic conclusions regarding the possible cost and benefits of the directive
Despite these difficulties , the Commission has carried out a qualitative analysis of the possible impact of the Directive , based on all available information
The following conclusions are very important in this respect
Secondly , even in cases where some changes may be required , the actual effect will be mitigated by the flexibility offered by the directive
In conclusion , the Commission considers that the proposal will help to realise the full employment potential of the sector in Europe
It will improve the social acceptance of temporary agency work and will make it more attractive
This point has also been underlined by the CI@@ E@@ TT in its own study
The availability , in particular , of workers with higher qualifications and more diversified skills will encourage more enterprises to employ temporary workers
This will allow agencies to recruit their workers from a larger pool of candidates and to expand into new areas
Lastly , as regards the United Kingdom , it is important to mention the regulatory impact assessment by the Department of Trade and Industry in the UK
It estimates that the directive will have a positive effect on total employment and on temporary agency workers ' productivity
It also recognises that it could result in greater job security for agency workers and an increase in the attractiveness of agency work
I should like to thank the Commissioner for that interesting reply
I must point out to her that the UK already meets the 70 % employment rate target
It simply does not make sense
As the Commissioner for Employment she must take notice of what people are telling her
First , may I say - and I imagine you will agree - that the real world exists in every country , not just Great Britain
It is not true that Great Britain has more temporary workers than any other country
2 % , compared with 4
In the United States of America , it is highly profitable and attracts a great deal of investment
So we have a model that does not increase payment costs
This legislative intervention affects a very small number of workers at present - 1
However , what is important is that it introduces a framework which secu@@ res minimum workers ' rights for the future development of this sector
If minimum rights - no more and no less - were protected , it would become a dynamic sector
That is the view taken by Confederation itself
As I said at the beginning , the CI@@ E@@ TT has surve@@ yed these agencies , which believe that a broad legislative framework will give better results and enlarge the market
The most recent CI@@ ET ? study concluded that , with the right legislative framework and with basic insurance for workers , these agencies could be employing 6
That represents an increase of 4 million people
I repeat , I shall be using the assessment by the agencies themselves , not just the Commission 's assessment
I am intrigu@@ ed by your replies , Commissioner
Firstly you say that a lot of your evidence is based on what CI@@ E@@ TT has said to you
Certainly CI@@ E@@ TT have said to me that they are appalled by this directive , and I will be having further conversations with them on the basis of your reply today
You also say how temporary work is flourishing in the Netherlands
My information is that the temporary work sector in the Netherlands has declined since their domestic law changed
The Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers , the V@@ NO@@ -@@ NC@@ W , wants to reintroduce flexibility
It has had several meetings with me asking whether I can get further support for my amendments in that respect
You say that the directive is based upon all available information
We are talking about thousands of jobs
The reason for its review is your directive
As you know Mr Bushill-Matthews , before the Commission made this particular proposal , this directive was the subject of discussion between the trades union and employers
We have not added so much as a comm@@ a over and above the minimum protection for workers
You said my evidence is based on what the CI@@ E@@ TT has said to me
I am open to any information they may have to give me
And , of course , I cannot argue , I cannot talk about no insurance , about no pension rights or any such contributions that have to be paid
Only then does it call for identical working conditions and this , of course , is highly complicated
However , I am more than willing to discuss the individual elements with any agency at all
In Sweden , the number of people written off sick has so@@ ared in recent years and there are also signs of a disturbing trend in other Member States
At the same time , the birth rate in Europe is at a record low
Over the next 50 years , therefore , the population in Germany , Italy and France , for example , will decrease dramatically
An ageing population creates a strain on the economy to provide pensions and a social safety net
The EU summit held in Stockholm in March 2001 identified the demographic challenge as one of the Union 's priorities for the future
Meeting the demographic challenge is one of the main problems facing the countries of Europe
Naturally , any demographic policy has to be a combination of individual policies and economic and social incentives , most of which come under the Member States and their jurisdiction
There are two parts to this problem
The second set of policies is designed to reinforce the family so that people can have more children , given that numerous countries have a very low birth rate
This will do a great deal to help families
I wish to thank the Commissioner most sincerely for her answer
Might Commissioner Diamantopoulou be interested in actually having , parallel to the growth targets , ongoing statistics concerning the birth trend in the European Union ?
Building a family is the great project of people 's lives , and one which I got to experience myself during the nineties
Parallel to having growth targets set , might the Commissioner see herself using statistics in order very carefully to monitor the birth trend in Europe ?
These are detailed , accurate statistics which map the situation in Europe from one year to the next
Commissioner Diamantopoulou , I too am very much in favour of increasing the birth rate in the European Union , as , moreover , is the Italian Government
Indeed , Mr Mar@@ oni has announced that a law which has just entered into force will provide incentives for young couples
I tell my pensioners to do what they can to increase the number of babies born too , and they have assured me that they will do their best
The question I would like to put to you now is as follows
Would it not be better to have more jobs as well as more babies ?
The example of the United States , where the population is expanding fast as immigrants integrate , is an important example
Firstly , it is a great pleasure to have the Commissioner here
I have been listening to the debate on the television in my office and I heard your answers to my colleagues
I want to follow up on Mr Fatuzzo 's question because it is in my report on information and communication technology and its impact on SMEs
Information and communication technology is an area where we could use them , if there were financial incentives to train them
Afterwards , if they were working , it would be important not to tax them on their income because they have a pension as well
This would have two impacts
Firstly , it would allow older people to work and still use their skills
Therefore their disposable incomes would have an impact on rural economies because they would tend to spend that income
Secondly , we would not be so dependent on imported labour
Obviously a high birth rate is a good thing , but it would take years before this was reflected in the labour force
My recommendation would provide a quick solution
I should like to hear the Commissioner 's view on it
I agree that , at the moment , we urgently need to integrate workers over 55 years old into the European labour market
The figures are indeed worrying
Only 37 % of people over 55 are still in work in Europe
Early retirement has been used as a restructuring mechanism in most countries for years now
It has put a large number of people out of work and of course , as the information society re@@ structures , older workers are the first to go
When we analyse pension systems and their problems , we generally talk of the need to increase the retirement age
Under the Barcelona target , every country undertook to have 50 % of the over-@@ 5@@ 5@@ s in work by 2010
Of course , there is the major social sector you referred to , where you do not have full employment but you offer social services with certain specific incentives
This is the active ageing policy we constantly support and which is included in our guidelines
Women 's access to the armed forces and sexual harassment
With reference to Directive 200@@ 2/@@ 7@@ 3/EC
It is my pleasure to be here , particularly when the discussion is so interesting and there are so many participants
Moreover , Member States have to take the necessary measures to encourage employers to prevent harassment and sexual harassment in the work place
These provisions concern the private and public sectors and include the armed forces
The new directive reinforces protection for victims of discrimination based on sex with specific provisions reflecting the case-law of the Court
By this date , these measures , including those on harassment and sexual harassment , should also cover the armed forces
Member States should guarantee by this date that all necessary measures have been taken to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sex in all matters covered by this directive
Because a year ago now the Minister promised in the Spanish Parliament to fulfil certain commitments to speed up these cases , but has not done so
Commissioner , what measures could we take to encourage the application of this directive ?
I would very much like some measure to be taken in this regard
This is a serious case of sexual assault within the army which is yet to be dealt with
It is also a European issue , Commissioner , because I have investigated and there are other cases throughout Europe
Mr President , because the directive has yet to be implemented , the Commission cannot operate in an effective way
I believe that it is very important to tell the minister about a very specific instrument that he can use before the implementation of the legislation
This instrument is the code of practice of the Commission , annexed to the Commission 's 1991 recommendation
It is a code of practice concerning the need to prevent sexual harassment or harassment in the workplace
It envisages specific policy measures
These include informing workers , communicating to workers the main mess@@ ag@@ es; training them; training the middle managers on this issue and then taking responsibility
The employer must take the responsibility for creating an environment which prevents sexual harassment
The employer must give the employee the opportunity and the right to complain and to discuss with a particular person in management his or her particular problem
They can put in place these first steps to prepare the armed forces for the implementation of the directive
It will be a pleasure for me to send the code of practice to the minister
It may be helpful to the armed forces in Spain
We cannot ask any more questions , Mr Mor@@ a@@ es , unless you ask a supplementary question to the question by Mrs Izquierdo
I know the Commissioner has a personal commitment to anti-racism and the Article 13 package
It is kind of her to take this supplementary question
Very briefly , the Commissioner was unable to attend the UN World Conference on Racism but her commitment was conveyed there
The concern amongst NGOs and many other players in this Article 13 package is that while those Member States with race equality legislation
As the time allocated to Question Time to the Commission is at an end , Questions Nos 48 to 81 will be answered in writing
The next item is the debate on transport policy for 2010
We cannot give the railways any greater role than they deserve or can cope with in view of their current performance
The large degree of flexibility , efficiency and reliability that road transport offers have led to tremendous growth in that sector
The quality of road transport is crucial , and it is this that supports the European economy
We must therefore continue to invest in improvements , for example , by making the roads more intelligent and by developing the road network
A competitive economy for Europe stands or falls on a healthy European transport sector
The scope for growth in this sector is still very great
Comb@@ ining this with short sea shipping makes inland waterway transport a mode of transport that is really to be reckoned with
Funding the transport infrastructure for all modes of transport seems to be a major problem throughout Europe
The train infrastructure , in particular , will cost citizens billions in the future
All of this will have to be funded by passing on the external costs that have to be introduced at the same time for all modes of transport
Cross-@@ subsidising , as proposed by the Commission , is only acceptable in specific areas , such as the Alps and the Pyrenees
We are not against this , therefore , Mr Swoboda
We cannot have extra-@@ heavy duties being imposed on road transport in order to then use the proceeds to finance the railways
This goes against the principle of the free market economy , whereby all means of transport must enjoy the same conditions of competition
It is not a good idea to use pricing as a tool , therefore , but , if it is used , it must be used fairly
The consumer pays and the polluter pays , but each should pay for his own pollution and consumption rather than those of a competing mode of transport
I disagree , because in context , all modes of transport must be treated equally , at the same time
We never promised that there were politicians who were going to impose even more duties on the trains
We are resigned to that , so , then , let us not see it happening to the roads
The majority of the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats is absolutely not rejoicing at the prospect of these two initiatives
every victim of a traffic accident is one too many
A loo@@ ser form of coordination seems to us a more suitable way
Mr President , I should first like to thank the rapporteur for his work and also for his efforts to reconcile diverse positions , about which we have heard today
I think that the White Paper gives European transport policy a great opportunity to draw the right conclusions from the ruthless analysis that it contains
This must not be to do no@@ thing; we cannot hide our heads in the sand , as this might well make a transport policy meltdown inevitable
5 % and between 1990 and 1996 alone , ten football fields ' worth of new motorways were constructed every day
We simply cannot go on like this and a sea change in transport policy is the only answer
That is why we need a radical rethink , above all on freight transport , where we need a move to rail and waterways
This is therefore about a shift to environmentally friendly modes of transport and about making sustainability our basis and our yardstick
In my view the White Paper tends to neglect this aspect
I believe that the Commission has drawn the right conclusions from this analysis and that it has initiated many good measures
We have made substantial progress in rail policy and we have also made progress on maritime safety , not least - unfortunately - thanks to the Erika and the Prestige
One further very complicated area is still missing and that is internalising external costs
My final point , Commissioner , is one that you addressed in your speech earlier
We must not repeat these mistakes with the new Member States
Proce@@ d@@ urally , we in the European Parliament are bound by this report
I did not envy the rapporteur
A clear report on such a broad topic with its challenging title ' for 2010 ' seemed a huge task
I am satisfied with the outlines and I believe we can move forward
What I want is articulated wonderfully well and I am pleased with Mr Izquierdo 's contribution
What I want to say is that each mode of transport has its own comparative benefits , and this is what we must focus on in the first instance
I can see good opportunities in the future for rail and inland navigation , but also for coastal navigation
Mr President , apart from soldiers and sailors it used only to be the richest and most powerful of people who found themselves a long way from home
Only a small , privileged group was able to buy goods that were produced a long way away
Nowadays the economy has experienced such a colossal increase in scale that many people work somewhere other than where they live and spend their holidays even further from home
Ra@@ w materials and sem@@ i@@ finished and finished products are moved enormous distances from places where production is cheapest to other places where many buyers willing to pay high prices are expected
For a long time it was only the benefits of this increase in scale that were stressed
It was seen as a great leap forward that the transport required was becoming comparatively cheaper and cheaper
More and more people are now experiencing the drawbacks
We know now that it is important to reduce unnecessary traffic and to choose modes of transport that take up little space and pollute the environment less
So it is time to choose
Which is , coinci@@ dentally , the title of the European Commission 's White Paper on transport for 2010 that we must evaluate today
Are we really making a choice ?
The initial reactions of both organisations of interested parties and this Parliament were unfortunately negative
European Union policy would therefore have to be directed at the creation of overcapacity at the taxpayer 's expense
This overcapacity could also lead to more intense competition
This would mean that workers , especially those on the railways and in the ports , would be less certain of keeping their jobs and maintaining their incomes
They would then be played off against people in other sectors who would be no more certain of a stable supply of work
All kinds of liberalisation proposals may turn out to have a negative impact on people and their living environment
Unfortunately , it looks as though the choices that are the most desperately needed will still not have been made to the extent necessary by 2010
Then we shall be seeing the replacement of railways by motorways in the new Member States , a development that Mr Piecyk rightly warned of just now
This is not the way to go and unfortunately we do not have enough of that guarantee
Everyone knows we are facing an enormous growth in traffic and Mr Piecyk has today set out all the awful effects this will have
To summarise briefly they are the social effects , environmental and health effects and safety effects and globalisation has a part to play in this
In short , I think that the problem is accurately described in the White Paper
In the Netherlands this is absolutely an existing line of policy and I should like it to be taken seriously at European level
It is a sectoral approach
Everyone can imagine what happens if you decide to produce more regionally , for example in the agriculture sector
Then you have no need to transport any meat or transport any animals
A second option of course is to tackle it with new technology
Where the modal shift is concerned , I heard Mrs Peijs arguing just now that rail must not receive this stimulus from the European Union
I must say that I see more in the practical approaches , in Switzerland for example , than in the theoretical considerations
Finally , moreover , I support the standpoint concerning the expansion issues and the exhor@@ tation not to slip back into the same mistakes , as previously indicated
A key feature of EU transport policy is durability
Within it , the environment is in our view the most important aspect
We are pleased that the Kyoto objectives take centre stage in the resolution
Its implementation seems less easy
It is only with rigorous measures that we can eradicate the area of tension between growing transport flows and increasing environmental pollution
measures that have an impact on the modal split
Here too we hear arguments that this is undesirable
After all , users - the market - must choose which modes they use in the end
Nobody can or will deny that this has led to major side effects
Let us not lose sight of the reality and the conditions in the market with these actions
Not all the ideal conditions will prove to be attainable
That is certainly true of the accession countries , where transport policy is moving in an undesirable direction
It surprises me that many colleagues - who support the free market - here in particular advocate a patronising policy
In our opinion , the success of given planning situations usually has an historical or geographical origin
Attempts to imitate such success with major injec@@ tions of capital are expensive and will not be capable of eradicating the differences
A European planning policy does not therefore seem sensible to us
Mr President , we have a comprehensive resolution before us
I therefore commend our amendments to our fellow MEPs
Mr President , the whole approach of the White Paper on European transport policy is inconsistent , though we recognise the fine work of the rapporteur
It gives a good basis for a more critical report in the future
But it is contradictory to propose , at the same time , the liberalisation and opening of markets in the railway sector , totally abandoning public services
Transport is crucial to economic sustainability and internal balance in any community , be it the European Union as a whole or a small country like my own
This contradictory approach makes it entirely possible to ignore the concept so dear to the Commission of sensitive regions in the very sensitive area of the Pyrenees
As Mr Bouwman said , we should take into account what is going on in Switzerland in this field of transport
Could the Commissioner tell me when the Pyrenees will have its own ' Alpine Convention ' ?
This is a well-@@ produced piece of work on the part of the Commission which allows us to look as far forward as 2010
May I also thank the rapporteur , Mr Izquierdo Collado , on his report
I should like to qualify these principles by making a few comments on some of the individual issues
We therefore need to increase funding under the Community budget specifically for trans-European networks
Secondly , we need to open up the railway market
Thirdly , we need to strengthen short sea shipping
This is vital , especially in certain areas of the European Union , and of course helps to protect the environment
The Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats is not united on this issue
Finally , two brief comments on measures to promote safety at sea and charging for infrastructures
Mr President , I should first like to thank the Commissioner very much for the White Paper that she has presented
It is not a radical reform , but it will have far-reaching consequences for future transport policy
As always with such compromises , however , there are of course a number of inconsistencies that I should like to point out
paragraph 9 states that there should be some degree of shift to rail , but that under no circumstances should this negatively affect the competitiveness of road transport
Neither is it a question , as it says in paragraph 10 , of forcing modal shift
In any case , the shift will only affect certain sectors
Of course we need heavy goods vehicles too
Finally , let me address the issue of cross-@@ financing
I believe that it is right to refer in paragraph 75 to the fact that what the Commission is proposing is the right way forward
This is therefore simply about redressing the balance and this should be stated here
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too wish to thank the rapporteur , Mr Izquierdo Collado , for a report prepared so well and thoroughly
The rapporteur has introduced notable improvements to the Commission proposal
The major objectives are the relief of congestion , the creation of hu@@ bs , improved safety and the promotion of sustainable transport
These are targeted primarily at the Union 's central regions
I would like to remind everyone of the transport needs in outlying and remote districts and regions , and geographically problematic areas
Good and viable transport links are vital for these areas , which have thin traffic flows
These needs are virtually ignored in the Commission White Paper
Account has to be taken of the special needs of sparsely populated island and mountain areas in any development of a common transport policy
Good transport links will ensure that the whole of the area of the Union remains within the scope of a functional single market and that all Union resources are spent
I would like to mention one final detail
A harsh winter has exposed a new type of safety risk in sea transportation
Con@@ sign@@ ments of oil in the Baltic Sea from Russia 's new oil port have increased in number
At the same time the risk of oil disasters in exceptionally icy conditions in winter has grown
The EU , like the International Maritime Organisation , has no agreement regarding how fit a ship carrying oil is to travel through ice
This breach in safety arrangements should be swiftly put right
Mr Izquierdo Collado 's report provides a series of amendments that should be supported with a view to respecting the environment
He also makes proposals for the harmonisation of fuel taxation and transport charges
With regard to road safety , I think it is good that he calls for the creation of a Road Safety Agency
As you will have understood , however , I cannot support his backing for the liberalisation processes underway
We are examining directives on rail , air transport , and on nautical and technical services next week , all aiming to liberalise these sectors
We should , of course , support the call for the Commission to assess the consequences of liberalisation , as Mr Collado does
I believe , however , that we should also strengthen public services by modernising them
My group also considers that the report should be more concerned with social issues
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur , Mr Izquierdo , on his excellent work
Well , between them is located the province of Gran@@ ada , which has the lowest income in Spain and in Europe
If infrastructures do not get there , how are we going to develop ?
These are examples of the infrastructure deficit of the peripheral regions of the Union
While the different Community policies allow these bottlenecks , there is little or nothing we can do to create cohesive transport and intermodality from social and environmental points of view
We must continue to work to increase safety standards in transport and its infrastructures , pin@@ pointing black spots and protecting them
Ladies and gentlemen , if only for money , let us work , let us invest more in safety
One death costs us EUR 1 million and we have 40 000 deaths a year on the roads
The report does not mention non-@@ transport
We must work on an innovative aspect , which is the pedestri@@ anisation of the cities
Mr President , Madam Vice-President of the Commission , firstly my sincere thanks go to the Vice-President for the White Paper that she has written with her colleagues
I hope that you will tell us how likely you think it is that we will still be able to conclude the second railway package in this legislative period
We want to take best practice and see how we can reduce the number of deaths on the roads and achieve higher levels of road safety on this basis
If there is no European legislation , what do we need a new road safety agency for ?
I would suggest that we should ensure that the maritime agency , the air safety agency and the railway agency do their jobs properly
But let us not have yet another agency
I must say to the rapporteur that I cannot support paragraph 79 , which advocates the setting up of another new transport fund , either
it is your region and your Member State that will have to improve local public transport in your cities
We cannot spend European funds on tasks that are the responsibility of the Member States
We need the resources that we have for the trans-European networks
As it is we have too few resources here
We already have the Cohesion Fund , the regional fund and the ISPA fund
Ladies and gentlemen , let us not have yet another European transport fund
We need to support the trans-European networks and leave the rest to the Member States
Our thanks go to the rapporteur for his successful consensu@@ s-@@ building , which is always an arduous task
The exact same number - exactly 60 - of specific legislative proposals are still gathering dust in the Council
That is the reality of transport policy and I think it is a scandal
Pu@@ rely ari@@ th@@ me@@ tically speaking we are therefore practically back in 1992 , at the beginning of the process of implementing the last White Paper
I should like to stress two points today
Firstly , we urgently need a compromise on matters concerning Galileo
There is a danger that the deadlock will call into question one of our flagship projects in transport and industrial policy
It is surely absurd that first no Member State wanted to pay and now they are arguing about whether more should be paid
In terms of development , we were three years ahead of the American G@@ P@@ S@@ 3 system
Secondly , there is a lot of movement in the European skies and this is now reflected in our legislation
These are pressing , problematic matters and we are in danger of getting bogged down in them , but they are crucial and decisive for the issues we are addressing
The rapporteur himself criticised this very firmly and I would thank him for that
He tells us that sustainable development must comprise the basis for a European transport policy , and I agree
He calls for global transport management , and I agree
I also agree , of course , with his concern for safety and social requirements
Our rapporteur speaks of the need for greater balance between modes of transport , which is good , but this is not sufficient , far from it
As I requested during the debate on the sixth FR@@ DP , we need further research in the field
In particular , we should quickly redirect public investment by means of public borrowing , significant public borrowing
The year 2010 is in seven years and that is very close
It is however already 2003 and tomorrow we are finally approving the report of our colleague Izquierdo Collado on the transport policy White Paper
The White Paper makes plans for 2010
The time for elabor@@ ating the whole package of measures is now com@@ pressed into seven years
I therefore wish the Commission good luck with its implementation of all of this
The key to very many of the objectives that the Commission is setting itself is the fair price of modes of transport and infrastructures
It is therefore high time for the Commission finally to come forward with the Pric@@ ing Directive
A discussion that ties in closely with this is the demand for a kerosene tax
The Commission must move in this area
The White Paper makes it possible to make a powerful response to questions of this kind
It is now up to the Commission to work faster on the proposals that must follow this White Paper
This is a missed opportunity
Happy birthday , Mr D@@ haene , and I hope you enjoy the evening celebrating with your friends
Mr President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for this very authoritative work , but I would also like to add a comment of my own
It may be better to find a new methodology for dealing with the major chapters of the White Paper and to proceed section by section
I am proposing this for the very reason that it is extremely difficult to know what to say in two minutes on such a huge subject
In any case , we cannot fail to notice that they are not given enough consideration in the White Paper , that the way they are dealt with is inadequate
Your idea of indicating the European interest of some of these projects was brilliant , but it has not been carried through
Mr President , we must back a transport system in Europe that makes high demands in terms of the environment and safety
I therefore wish to thank the Commission and the rapporteur for the work that has been done on the White Paper
We are now emphasising even more clearly what we want to achieve in terms of the environment and safety
I appreciate our now being able to make a start on this work
I also appreciate , and completely support , the proposals to transfer freight from roads to railways and the sea
We must , however , remember that roads are of very great importance in certain parts of the EU , for example in the sparsely populated and peripheral regions
The various forms of transport must therefore complement one another
It is a great challenge to create a transport system in the EU because Europe does not constitute a homogeneous geographical area
We must therefore take account of different conditions , and trans-European networks are very important
It is important to create TEN corridors
If we invest in east@@ -@@ west TEN corridors , we can relieve the pressure on the central regions with their very high traffic density
There are advantages to backing trans-European networks
The rapporteur has very clearly succeeded in emphasising the importance of the peripheral regions and the regions characterised by long distances
The report sees increased account being taken of these aspects
I nonetheless have a number of points to make
I agree that we have great investment needs and that we must use trans-European networks
We must improve road safety in the EU
We are now awaiting the Commission 's third road safety programme and have been doing so for a long time
I hope that it will be in place soon
Mr President , Mr Izquierdo Collado is quite right to recall the obligation of transport policy to contribute to balanced development and to economic and social cohesion
No less importantly , account must be taken of people 's right to mobility that is safe , affordable and of high quality
To date no study has been produced and no one has been able to prove that opening up transport to competition can resolve the sector 's problems
On the contrary , where liberalisation has taken place , the results prove that exactly the opposite is true
Furthermore , the idea that guaranteeing the existence of various operators of these lines or routes leads to an initial situation of apparent openness systematically ends up creating real monopolies
The current discussion with regard to the air transport sector is enlightening on this matter
This is certainly a profitable business for these companies
The same is not true , however , for public operators
Despite that , unfortunately , our view has not changed
The report was b@@ illed as proposals and an action programme for transport until 2010 , but I believe strongly that it contains little more than ill-@@ researched , half-baked ideas
It should not surprise anyone that the majority of the ideas proposed could not be considered seriously , as the original Commission proposal was so back@@ war@@ d-@@ looking
Yet again , the age-old favourite of kerosene tax has po@@ pped up , another way of s@@ ne@@ aking it in through the back door
Competition also appears to have fallen by the wayside in this proposal
Either it was ignored deliberately or it was simply forgotten in the excitement of the rail enthusiasts in the Commission
It is clear that a European Road Safety Agency would be a total waste of taxpayers ' money and another pointless layer of bureaucracy
In addition , we also oppose the introduction of a European Transport Fund , as this re@@ e@@ ks of vested interest
One other point on taxation and infrastructure charging will be covered by my colleague Mr Bradbourn
In a nutshell , it is a retrograde , ill-@@ thought-out proposal , which we shall be voting against
Mr President , Commissioner , I think there are a few areas in which the European Union should make a commitment
That is why the Union needs resources
It needs money
The idea of a European fund is therefore not a bad idea
we need a great European loan in order to carry out great work
Naturally , that is out of date today
It sounds rather old-fashioned , but economics is not a science
Sometimes old ideas return , and just because Mr Key@@ n@@ es has returned to an old way of thinking , that does not mean the idea is bad
Beyond this financial aspect , I would like to draw your attention to three other aspects
First of all , Europe is enlarging eastwards , and our territory is therefore becoming unbalanced
I am putting the case here for the Atlantic coast in the West of Europe , although I am sure you are sensitive to its needs
The second aspect is that Europe has many ports , many shores and many coasts
We must therefore spare no expense with regard to maritime navigation
That would mean , with regard to maritime safety , that we should continue in the direction you have taken , which I believe to be the right one
We need to make progress with our regions on the transport dossier
Regional policy might comprise tripartite contracts in future and , from that point of view , transport is a good subject associating States , regions and Europe as a whole
I believe that this White Paper and this task provide a good opportunity for the Commission to build all these links
Nevertheless , it is appropriate at this stage to pay tribute to the work done by the current Commissioner for transport
In a short time she has got things moving
I should like to consider this issue by referring to one specific aspect of transport policy
Char@@ ges and funding instruments are , quite rightly , addressed specifically in paragraph 75 and those following it in Mr Izquierdo Collado 's report
Where transport is concerned , the key question is always what the transport service costs
That is why the true costs and the cost advantages of the individual modes of transport need to be compared properly and in detail
This afternoon we have been debating the Austrian transit system
Even a tunnel under Austria would not help if it were cheaper to travel through the country above ground
My request to you is therefore for some serious proposals on transport in particularly sensitive areas , and as soon as possible
Secondly , and turning more specifically to the report , I would like to make a series of comments
I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work and Kar@@ la Peijs , our shadow rapporteur , since she has made enormous contributions to this document
I will move on to the issues in the report
That is one of our group 's concerns
Secondly , I would like to express our support for the creation of a road safety agency
Finally , we also support the creation of the transport fund , with objectives and considerations other than the trans-European networks and the Structural Funds in the field of transport
We will support these two ideas which we consider to be positive
By critical situation , I am referring to the situation of land transport , Trans-European Networks , sea transport , air transport and transport safety in general
In other words , I would like to make it clear that these are regions which have severe structural difficulties and deficiencies caused by inappropriate decisions and policies
I represent in this House the citizens of two major islands - S@@ ic@@ ily and S@@ ard@@ in@@ ia - which have approximately 7 million inhabitants
I call for the undertakings given by European ministers in the Treaty of Amsterdam with regard to the outermost regions and islands not to be forgotten
I hope that the increasing liberalisation of transport will be accompanied by development guarantees for the disadvantaged regions
At the outset , I should like to say how much I agree with the comments my colleague , Mrs Foster , made earlier
Firstly , I find the whole anti-@@ road sentiment of this report baff@@ ling in the extreme
Yet this paper steadfastly ignores the road sector and is thus completely unbalanced
Comb@@ ining roads with other modes of transport is essential
I have no doubt that better public transport has a vital part to play in this transport strategy
However , road transport , quite rightly , remains the main choice for the majority , due to its ease and flexibility
Pen@@ alising people for using roads is an extremely dangerous step , yet this is exactly what the report advocates
One such example is the idea of infrastructure charging
Only a small proportion of that tax revenue is spent on improving transport
This is certainly the case in the United Kingdom
British Conservatives strongly opposed infrastructure charging in our country and we oppose it just as vehemently here in Europe
Yet this report goes deeper than just imposing direct charges on the public
By attempting to cut the link between transport and economic growth , we are ignoring clear evidence dating back centuries
Put simply , increased trade boosts a nation 's economy , raising its GDP
Even basic trade , however , would not be possible without an efficient transport system which is available to all
I acknowledge that this report was always going to be difficult and sympathise with the rapporteur , who is in a lo@@ se-@@ lose situation
However , my Conservative colleagues and I have serious doubts as to where this paper would lead us , with its severe implications for the entire transport industry
I therefore urge this House to reject the report in its entirety
Conversely , we cannot ignore the importance of transport in contributing to economic growth and development
The Irish situation is an excellent case study in point
Road traffic in Dublin has grown exponentially in the last decade , as we have experienced record growth levels in our economy
But the resulting congestion now acts as a serious brake on further growth
Here , we are talking about balance and the need to get it right
We also have the environmental impact on our air quality
Similarly , enlargement will also generate additional road transport
Infra@@ structure upgrading in candidate countries will require massive investment
As they grow their GDP and their per capita income - which we all hope they do - so traffic and congestion will increase pro r@@ ata
New TENs projects are needed to address existing and future bottlenecks , along with a sufficient infrastructure charging policy
In aviation , I fully support the S@@ K@@ Y initiative
I do not feel that harmonisation of fuel taxes has an essential part to play
Road transport will continue to be the dominant mode of transport for Member States for which alternative modes are not possible and not realistic
Even where they are , what will it take to get us out of our cars ?
Mr President , Mrs de Palacio , it is gratifying that the Commission is addressing Europe 's transport problems seriously
Reducing deaths on the road by 50 % is in particular an aim that deserves all our support
There is no good reason why anyone at all should die on the roads
Con@@ g@@ estion in Central Europe is also a big problem , while in the peripheral regions the worry is safeguarding links with the European markets
As well as the many good proposals , the White Paper unfortunately contains seriously mistaken evaluations
The Commission wants to break the link between economic growth and transport growth
That will not be possible , although we can certainly bring economic growth to a halt
By easing transport problems we can , without anxiety , allow traffic to increase
New vehicles will produce up to 90 % fewer emissions than those manufactured before 1970
This is not realised if you only take a blin@@ kered view of the matter
By abolishing all car registration taxes in Europe and lowering car tax for clean cars we will be able to improve the state of the environment radically
Another odd proposal is that of freezing the share of the market enjoyed by the different transport modes at 1998 levels
This is something we might expect from the old Soviet Union 's Pol@@ it@@ bur@@ o , but it weakens the Commission 's authority very much indeed
It would be nonsensical to set out to forcibly steer the market share balance in the direction of targets that have been decided in an ivory tower
We should instead create an equitable situation for competition for all modes of transport
Let the market itself then decide the natural balance for transport modes
The third error relates to the harmonisation of labour and social legislation
If we make these three mistakes we will be further than ever away from a dynamic Europe
The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the result of its own impossible situation , but our splendid European project deserves better
Our rigid economy is in need of care , and our self-inflicted sickness is actually not just an imag@@ inary one
Unfortunately , the Commissioner 's medicine seems as if , dare I say so , it had been bought in a b@@ az@@ a@@ ar
Would it not be about time we stopped talking about the European model and sought recipes for success among those who are getting along best ?
Mr President , Commissioner , thank you for attending this debate
Behind each of the speeches there is what I believe to be a fundamental concept
This fundamental concept is the single European transport area , a European area of transport which is not only compatible with European asymme@@ try but which must actually incorporate it
A few months ago , Commissioner , this House and the Council approved the sixth framework research programme
This programme established the single European area of research
we have passed the stage of you meeting to tell each other what you are doing and even to cooperate on friendly terms
Therefore , Commissioner , although there is apparently a rain@@ bow of diversity in this House , I can guarantee that we are very close together
I will end by thanking all the Members who have participated in this report , because they have offered me many ideas and entirely constructive cooperation
If we do not create a competitive transport system in Europe , the whole of our industrial fabric , the whole of our productive sector , will suffer
And this is the not always an easy task we must respond to through our proposals
I have taken good note of the clear support offered by Mr Izquierdo and Parliament 's proposed report
I believe that all these points are very interesting and worthy of our attention and they deserve to be highlighted in this report
However , I would like to make a few comments with regard to the important points which have been raised here and in the report
I believe we should consider the steps to be taken in order to achieve this objective
At the end of the day , they are the same idea
I believe that this sentence is fundamental
Europe cannot afford to make road transport less competitive , since it forms the basis of its economic development , its growth and its international competitiveness
It is a question of making , for example , the railways as competitive as road transport
The honourable Members also propose the creation of great axes of roads and railways , as laid out in paragraph 36 and others
We must insist on strengthening the railways
This is a fundamental point and we cannot ignore it
Paragraph 36 and others refer to this aspect
We must therefore not be dogmatic , but we must have a practical appreciation of the reality of European transport needs
Can it be approached in the way Mr Izquierdo Collado proposes ?
They are of interest at European level because they promote - I would insist - the creation of the internal markets and the integration of the European area itself
other formulae to bring us closer , of course , and we must also promote public-private participation in funding
I will shortly present all these issues in that infrastructures package , including charging
Before 2004 , the Commission will draw up a communication on the transport situation in the candidate countries
We do not believe that a specific communication is necessary in 2003 because we are going to produce two reports
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
The next item is the joint debate on the following reports tabled by the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy
Van Velzen , on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive on the re-use and commercial exploitation of public sector documents
This is actually rather a sad moment
I hope that this is not symbolic , Mr President , for the future of the spring European Council that is to take place shortly
Minimum harmonisation because otherwise nothing will come of any pan-European content services in the public information field
We know from research , in the United States for example , that there is great potential in , as it were , marketing existing public information
In the United States we have already seen that this can be done exceptionally well by stimulating re-use , by making this information available at marginal cost
And the first political question of course is why are we not doing the same in Europe ?
You must therefore at this point in particular try to give this 3@@ G sector every possible chance
There was a lot of discussion as to whether or not cultural institutions , universities , research institutions , etc , should be excluded under this directive
Mr President , there are still Member States that are trying to build in an extra filter to ensure that everyone has to apply for licences again , etc
In the report we make a distinction between other information and basic information
This basic information is information that every citizen needs to be able to function in a normal constitutional state
You really must be able to make this information available to the citizen free of charge so that this citizen can exercise his normal rights as a citizen
This additional information must , moreover , be made available at marginal cost
Why should not this Parliament occasionally be the driving force behind a new development in the field of the information society ?
I therefore also make an urgent appeal to our fellow MEPs to follow me in this direction
First of all I want to thank both rapporteurs very much for their work , their sharing of responsibility and above all their effort in producing such an excellent report
This innovative chain that has to be developed requires a very great deal of investment that the operators cannot provide alone
I also think it is important to bring the regions where 3@@ G is already in development close together because people learn from one another
This is also a way of preventing people encountering the same pitfalls
It is very important , Mr President , that we stimulate research so that the present research in relation to 3@@ G does not become concentrated in Japan in particular
We must not look to the US , we must look at our great setbacks in the field of competition with Japan
Not before time , because we all know that security is a major concern
Bra@@ vo to the Commission that it has actually arrived
All in all , therefore , it is perfectly normal for us to have this kind of joint debate
' Technological convergence affords all business and citizens new opportunities for access to the Information Society
Digital television and third-generation mobile communications will play a key role in providing widespread access to interactive services '
This sector of the third generation , however , seems to be in difficulties
We must also learn from the experience of the current GSM market in order to avoid re@@ producing the mistakes that might have been made in the past
One key aspect of mobile telephony development is the interoperability of terminals
In this area , the Commission would point out that progress was made in the development of 3@@ G terminals in 2002
The first models are ready
They are also ready in China , and I am pointing this out to you because we received this information last week
Furthermore , the existing 2@@ G networks have been modernised to make them 2
Some technical problems may persist , but we can say that everything is working
With regard to the market situation , the current availability of 3@@ G services in Europe is not clear
With regard to regulatory issues , the Commission would point out that the procedure for granting 3@@ G licences has begun in all the countries of the European Union
This number of licences is sufficient
There is therefore no problem as far as the competitive environment is concerned
Following discussions with the parties concerned with the introduction of 3@@ G mobile communications , a consensus was reached on three points
First of all , the introduction phase for 3@@ G services does not require legislative intervention
Market forces must be allowed to take effect
Secondly , 3@@ G communications will , in the long term , have to become one of the platforms for services provided by a global Information Society
Lastly , the public authorities must provide constant support in the introduction process
We therefore need to increase coordination of all these decisions
The Commission believes that no changes will be required in the granting of licences and that the period of validity of licences will not be altered in the short term
The legislation does , however , require clarification in terms of network infrastructure sharing
As rapporteur , I therefore feel that the Commission has judged the matter correctly in terms of the economy , but that a number of points should have been added
Ultimately , it is the market that will decide , but it is good to raise the question and be prepared
Lastly , secure payment must be protected , or the consumer will have no confidence in this system
I shall now discuss the precautionary principle , which Members from the right , furthermore , wanted to dispose of
I want to discuss the health problems that can arise , for they are now raised by numerous scientists
A consensual request was made that the requirements of the World Health Organisation should at least be respected at European level
We are told that this is now the case , but it still remains to be verified
Lastly , the construction of 3@@ G aer@@ ial repe@@ aters should take place with due respect for the environment and land use planning
The Member States will ensure that authorisations from the land use planning departments are subject to a clear procedure and a public enquiry
Four to sixteen times more aer@@ i@@ als are needed for third-generation communications than for 2@@ G
Co@@ location or aer@@ ial sharing , as recommended by the Commission , is therefore extremely important
In conclusion , regulatory stability will enable this technology to develop smoothly if the European Union gives the same importance to social and environmental parameters as to economic parameters
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would in fact like to thank all the rapporteurs for their excellent levels of cooperation
We are now giving the Council a clear message , and , hopefully , an impetus no longer to d@@ ally in this area
I would like to speak more about the report drawn up by my colleague , Mr Van Velzen
It is a very important start and represents a crucial change in the development of the information society
It is perhaps a good idea to have confidence in the words he spoke , which were truly appropriate
The information society sector is a major employer and a factor which unites us all in Europe as a whole in a completely new way
Its development will bring with it significant economic , political and cultural opportunities
Confidence in the sector , however , has plummeted and we know the reason why , as we have spoken about it so many times
It is the result of auctions and general uncertainty
Although digitalisation and networking offer a wide variety of opportunities for development , they have also led to a worldwide gulf between the people of prosperous countries and developing countries
many jobs have gone and some midd@@ le-@@ aged people have had to give up work
Furthermore , those groups which are in a weaker position are at risk of becoming doubly discriminated against
They are being left outside the information society
it is our biggest challenge
The network has also become a political implement
It increases opportunities for civil action and hopefully also opportunities for influence
I also urge the Commission to speed up the introduction of third generation mobile communications and eliminate the technical and administrative barriers there are in the sector
The Member States should offer their citizens sufficient Internet time , which is to say participation in the information society
The Commission should research the possibilities of developing vo@@ ic@@ e-@@ controlled services
These will shortly be available and will make it easier for all of us to use the Internet
Likewise , Member States should support SMEs and help them get online , as they represent major potential for increased employment
Perhaps there would be a need too for funds to be established in the Member States to help socially excluded groups to become integrated into the networked society
In my opinion it is good that the Commission has now established a cyber@@ security task force
It is now three years since the Lisbon strategy was created and it has met with political and economic uncertainty
We are seeing developments , but they are not fast enough or adequately coordinated
In the last six years we have seen around a million new jobs created a year , although last year the figure was only around half a million
Commissioner , what could you do so that certain Member States do not slow down development in this sector ?
It will create work and opportunities , but problems too
Mr President , first of all thank you to Commissioner Liikanen , it is a pleasure to see you here
SMEs drive economic grow@@ th@@ ; they train people with poor sk@@ ill@@ s; they identify local needs and respond by producing or processing the products required
They create employment , wealth and security for the local community
What are the hindrances , difficulties and bottlenecks facing SMEs in the EU ?
Why are they not growing as fast as those in the USA ?
Pap@@ as and M@@ am@@ as in Europe in their fif@@ ties and sixties own and manage their businesses traditionally
They are reluctant to invest in new technology because , firstly , they suspect that the investment will not offer sufficient advantage
Secondly , they do not understand the scope and function of new technology in increasing productivity and expanding sales
Thirdly , they are concerned about security of supply , quality , payment and legal liability
My report has analysed the problems facing SMEs and offers a programme of action to stimulate them , so that they can compete globally
I would like Commissioner Liikanen to take very careful note of this summary , which is what I think the EU needs to do and do now
Review existing regulation of the e-economy and cut drastically whatever burdens small businesses
Re@@ duce the administrative burdens on businesses by simplifying data collection , especially tax collection
T@@ ack@@ le on-line security issues by reinforcing the depend@@ ability and reliability of networks used by enterprises
En@@ courage cross-border trade to ensure a European e-economy
Use benchmarking to promote and establish best practice , to integrate SMEs in the e-economy
Allow Member States to offer low interest loans and tax incentives to support SMEs
I know Commissioner Monti might have a problem with that but I think it is essential
Establ@@ ish close cooperation between business , the educational sector and government agencies in order to close the IT skills gap
One of the most important aspects is to offer financial incentives to the unemployed and the elderly , those who are retired
When they work using those skills they should not be taxed at all , that is my preference
You might wish to impose a nominal tax , but preferably no tax at all
To offer financial incentives to technical support companies to allow SMEs affordable access
It is very expensive and very unreliable and we need to offer financial incentives in that respect
Technology can offer us this today , Commissioner Liikanen , let us produce more with ease , let us have less stress and more fun
Mr President , I am happy to see everyone with an interest in this field here tonight
I dream of a day when we can discuss this issue in the day@@ time - it may come
Information and communication technologies are a powerful source of growth and productivity gains , which contribute to improving our living standards
That is why the recovery of the sector is so important at this point in time
These reports also contribute to the process of building confidence in the ICT sector
I am also pleased to have the opportunity to inform you that the Commission adopted four important documents today
I hope you find them in your computers when you return to your offices
Let me reiterate our common commitment to an efficient and timely implementation of the new regulatory framework
With the recommendation on relevant markets we aim to give legal certainty and to help restore confidence to the sector
Let me come back to the themes of tonight and say a few words first on the report on 3@@ G
At this juncture , 3@@ G deployment is clearly a priority
We need to encourage solutions which favour a quick deployment of networks while also accommodating environmental needs
In today 's communication on the situation in the telecoms sector , the Commission calls for a series of actions to overcome barriers to 3@@ G deployment
Amongst these is the clarification of network infrastructure sharing , the importance of which was also emphasised in the report
Information to the citizens on the health aspects related to mobile communications and continued research are important
Scientific findings need to be made broadly available
The Commission will promote the diff@@ u@@ sion of information , for example through a specific web site
The World Health Organisation is the leading authority in this area , and we are working closely with it
Finally , I would like to stress the importance of 3@@ G in the context of access to open and interoperable platforms
This is to increase consumers ' choice and thus to contribute to the establishment of an information society for all
Inclu@@ siveness is an overriding principle in eEurope 2005
The Commission is committed to pursuing action toward openness and interoperability of platforms , as so clearly requested by Parliament
Let me briefly reiterate the main objectives of the eEurope 2005 action plan
This will stimulate and is stimulated by the supply side , by enabling the widespread availability and use of multi-@@ platform and secure broadband
It is vital to ensure an inclusive information society
Therefore we are promoting multi-@@ platform access which includes digital television , 3@@ G mobile , PCs , ki@@ o@@ s@@ ks and whatever terminals are available
I am pleased to see that Mr Paasilinna 's report gives such strong support to the main ideas of the eEurope Action Plan
Mr Paasilinna asked how we could accelerate access for the Member States
We continue to carry out rigorous reporting and benchmarking of the activities
At the same time , we have launched two presentations of European best practice in e@@ Government and e@@ Health
We will nominate these best practices and ensure they are widely diff@@ used among the public authorities in all Member States
As Mr Khanbhai 's report on the impact of e@@ Economy notes , SMEs are key drivers of economic growth and should be encouraged actively to engage in the e@@ Economy
We agree that European businesses , and especially SMEs , need support in ' going digital '
The Commission is currently working together with the Member States to set a new policy framework for e@@ Business policies for SMEs , including potential quantitative targets
Network security has become a major policy concern and therefore a central issue in the eEurope 2005 action plan
Parliament 's position on this matter of October last year was very much appreciated
As I mentioned earlier , the Commission today adopted a draft regulation on the Agency
As Mr Van Velzen said today and as he underlines in his report , the content is essential for further development of the information society
The key elements are transparency of procedures and of conditions for re-use , non-discrimination and fair competition
The directive will stimulate the creation of information services based upon , or incorporating , public sector information
It is important for the content industries and also for the telecoms sector , which needs to find ways to generate content for 3@@ G services
I fully share the opinion of Mr Van Velzen that the operators should work together to create a marketplace
We need cooperation and interoperability to create a market which can convince the consumers
Mr President , I wish to thank all the Members for this important debate and for their contribution to the whole process since we started work on the telecoms framework
I too hope that the debate will take place during the day next time
It will be better for the Chairman too
The promotion of free computer programs is an option increasingly used by public administrations and which democra@@ tises access to and the use of public documents and data
Furthermore , the advertising of all generally accessible documents , including those relating to judicial and administrative procedures , must reach the public sector
This is a fundamental instrument for the development of the right of citizens to knowledge and a fundamental principle of democracy
I would end by stressing that we naturally believe that all these principles should also apply to the European institutions
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , allow me first to make a few remarks on the Auroi report
The mobile communications industry is in a bad way
In comparison with Japan , 3@@ G technology is coming on stream only very slowly
We must also do all we can at European level to support this sector
All of this is , as you know , also provided for in the Commission 's paper
Although consumers benefit from the reasonable charges that regulation brings , they only do so in the short term
Against this background , a broad majority of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy supported this report and the promotion of 3@@ G
This report is a clear vote in favour of the introduction of third generation mobile communications in the European Union
I should now like to offer a few thoughts on the Van Velzen report on the re-use and exploitation of public-sector documents
Of course I must first express my very special thanks to Mr Van Velzen for the work that he has done as rapporteur
He has displayed a great deal of commitment to his report and once again this has borne fruit in the form of a good report
Like the majority of the Committee on Industry I too share the view that in principle public information should be made available for the benefit of all parties
The authorities in the Member States have huge quantities of information that has been collected over long periods of time
Members of the public and businesses should also benefit from this trea@@ sure tro@@ ve of information , whose commercial value is difficult to put a figure on
I am confident that general access to public information will give a significant boost to growth , competitiveness and employment within the European Union
But despite all of the agreement expressed in the debate so far , I am still missing an essential point
must Europe really take action here ?
Is not the issue of determining the conditions under which and the extent to which public information is made available a matter for the Member States ?
For my part , I do not see that there is any legal basis for harmonisation in this field
The old saying is true here that not every problem in Europe is a problem for Europe
This is also why several of the German members of my group will be voting against the report
I might also remind you that the issue of de@@ limiting competences is also proving to be significant in the debate that is currently ongoing in the Convention
Mr President , I congratulate all four rapporteurs , who have worked long and hard on their dossiers
I also welcome my fellow veterans of information technology debates
We might have to award ourselves a Lisbon me@@ dal for stamina at some stage
I take your point about the timing of this debate
We need to join together and make serious protests in the future
I should like , first of all , to comment on Mr Van Velzen 's report on reuse of public information
I commend him on the amount of work he has put into this
What is important about this proposal ?
First of all , it is important that progress be made
What has become very clear to me as I have shad@@ owed this report is what an important economic engine reuse of public information is going to be
We need to make sure that progress is made on that
Secondly , it is important to support the exemptions included in the Commission proposal for universities , libraries and museums across the European Union
We want that exemption to continue
The third thing of importance is to ensure a reasonable return on investment
I have listened carefully to what the rapporteur had to say
I want the amendment in the name of my group - Amendment No 33 - to stand
It clarifies Parliament 's position
A reasonable return on investment is important and should be taken into consideration
I understand there is likely to be a major second reading and quite a lot of work to be done at Council level
No doubt we will be able to return to this at a later stage
Mr Khanbhai , who does not seem to be here , ended his speech by saying that he wanted to have fun
I am not sure how much fun he thinks is associated with debates held at this time of night on this subject
Mrs Auroi had a very difficult task
In terms of her work , I should like to stress the importance of 3@@ G companies and technologies being soundly managed and well run
That has not always been the case on a global scale
With regard to the Van Velzen report there are two things I would like to stress
Re-@@ use and commercial exploitation of public information , as proposed by the rapporteur , will lead to a real information society for all
Where basic information such as the wording of acts and jurisprudence is concerned , this must be made available to the European citizen free of charge
After all , as a taxpayer he or she has already paid for this information
We do not allow our citizens to pay for the same thing twice
Furthermore , good information is necessary for the functioning of a democratic constitutional state
In my opinion we as a Parliament must fight hard for the rights of the citizens
Public information must therefore be made available to the citizens free of charge or at marginal cost for reproduction and distribution
As a group we fully support the line of rapporteur Van Velzen
This brings me to my second point
Of course this is possible where added value is a factor
There is provision for this in the exceptions
The un@@ thinking inclusion in the directive of allowing a reasonable return on investment to be made seems highly dangerous to me
Because the question is , what is reasonable ?
Is it 10 , 20 or 30 % profit and do our citizens have to pay that ?
It is also important that the same conditions prevail in all the Member States
Subsidiarity in this case is fundamentally wrong
This is because we need a level playing field , only then can the internal market for public information be achieved
this directive must promote the reuse and the exploitation of public information
Because a market that is controlled by monopolists as now does not lead to more jobs and greater prosperity
It has already been said that the transfer of billions from the private sector to the public sector has been disastrous for the mobile telecoms sector
This means that we do not need to impose any unnecessary regulation now
Inter@@ vention may however be necessary to guarantee competition
Even then though we must ensure a level playing field
No unilateral measures by Member States to lighten the load of the mobile operators
We cannot have a situation in which France gives discounts on licences and other Member States renew licences
I think that the Commission must bring forward clear measures to guarantee that level playing field
This has happened too little to date
That is why it is good that the Commission is keeping its finger on the pul@@ se and keeping the minds of the leaders of the Member States on the matter
I wish us all , Parliament and Commission , success in the realisation of a better eEurope
Mr President , Commissioner , first I shall look for and I intend to find those responsible for the third generation mobile communications recession
The guilty parties are the governments of those countries that organised radio spectrum auctions and transferred the money companies in the sector had invested to themselves
The action taken by the public authorities to alleviate this slump in investment has not been sufficiently effective
Au@@ thor@@ isation has been granted for installations of equipment to coexist side by side for common use , but that is all
More realistic targets should be set
Now I have made my protests I would like to say thank you
That is democracy
This democracy must be promoted through public investment
This is one of the great issues of the future and one that offers the greatest opportunities , multiplied by our common efforts
Mr President , despite the late hour it has been a refreshing debate
It is important and good that we have gathered together so many excellent rapporteurs
I thank them all for tackling different aspects of the subject
I reflect on the Commissioner 's news that he has now given us another four reports to work on
We need to think about the most efficient way of making an input into the process
We have a shared interest in moving the knowledge economy forward
What we are talking about today is the tools , the means and the framework in which we do that
I have detected a bit of g@@ loom among a number of colleagues
However , it is worth reflecting on the fact that within weeks we will have the first commercial third generation services in a major country
They will be provided by a new investor in the market , not in any way connected with any of the incumbent companies
A new investor has made a commercial investment in the marketplace
Let us remind ourselves that the knowledge economy will be driven by private investment
That is where the bulk of the money is going to come from
The innovation and the technology are going to come from there as well
None of us know how and in what ways that technology is going to develop
That is the importance of third generation
The move to the third generation is going to open up new markets for small and large businesses
It will also take cost out of businesses and will help businesses do things differently
In Japan I have been to the research laboratories of Do@@ Co@@ M@@ o , the Japanese telecoms company , where they have people inventing third generation commercial applications
Let us remember , above all , that what we must do as politicians is to let the market work
That is what has been successful in mobiles so far
That is what will be successful in third generation
That is what will power the knowledge economy
That is the most crucial message that we must all remember
Perhaps , however , it is not just the market that will benefit , as has just been maintained
I believe that the benefit will lie in the development of this Information Society into a society that is equally focused on the human dimension
It is also , however , a society in which the risks of exclusion are many
Ign@@ oring these new developments at an individual level means taking the risk of suffering the consequences
Collec@@ tively , it means running the risk of whole segments of the population falling by the wayside
This progress does also provide opportunities for development
Information and knowledge are the raw material in this society and the source of new wealth
Creating a link between them to make them accessible means increasing the existing potential for innovation
It is essential , however , for the European Union 's public policy to keep pace with the development of these markets and harness the benefits of this development
A fair Information Society is therefore created metho@@ dic@@ ally and patiently with decisive strategies
These are essential elements if we are to ensure that 2010 is not merely a technological mirage
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , scientific progress has been nothing short of miraculous over the past decade , especially in information technology
Under different circumstances , this progress might translate into prosperity for society as a whole
Under the capitalist system , however , scientific progress serves the market , not society
In short , it becomes a source of profit for the few , rather than a source of prosperity for the many
Under these circumstances , the positive points in the Paasilinna report are of little practical value to disadvantaged social groups in danger of remaining excluded from the information society
What value , for example , are tele@@ matics health services or the famous European health card to these people ?
Who will be able to offer these services ?
The family doctor or the multinational companies that keep plundering the health sector ?
Will developing third generation services or European operational systems resolve the problem ?
Finally , I must comment on the proposal to create a market in public records
I admire the Commission 's entrepreneurial inventiveness and wonder what the next victim of the market will be ?
Perhaps the very air we breathe ?
Mr President , I would like to join with my colleagues in congratulating the four rapporteurs for their work on these reports
This comes at a very important time
Many colleagues have already spoken with regard to the detail of what is contained in these reports and our aspirations for the future
one c@@ lick and you have access to the whole world
Also , a lot of the services that should be provided for people on the Internet are not provided
A lot of these new technologies are too expensive for ordinary users to get access to
One of the school initiatives was that there should be one computer for every 15 pupils
we are now above that average
We have one computer for every 12 pupils and every pupil has em@@ ail access , Internet access and knowledge-based education in their school curriculum every day
On the healthcare side , one important development that can take place is the delivery of health services to rural and peripheral areas
This way they can give assistance rather than having to transport people over long distances
The last point that I would like to make is with regard to 3@@ G
I am very aware of the comments that Malcolm Harbour made in his speech and I agree with him , there is huge potential with regard to 3@@ G
We have already seen the huge explosion in the use of mobile technology
Mr President , I think this is an exciting debate , and I think our rapporteurs have done a quite outstanding piece of work that has also been duly recognised
I have a couple of remarks relating to the use and re-use of public information
One example that might be mentioned is the significant interest shown in Denmark in a certain mayor 's restaurant and travel bills
Since everyone in Denmark has access to such documents , simply by asking to see them , there were too many people who asked to see them
The documents were therefore posted on the Internet so that any citizen could see each and every original document there
Why is this kind of data made available free of charge , and why is such use of the Internet encouraged ?
Firstly , the more that people do for themselves , the faster the responses they receive and the fewer civil servants we have to employ
Data can be made available free of charge , moreover , because the public savings are as substantial as they are
I too have been a mayor and I am therefore curious to know whether this was a specific case or whether all the mayors were in this situation
You can tell me individually another time
Mr President , I congratulate all the rapporteurs for their work on these reports
They have become one of the EU 's top priorities
Their aim to adopt existing policies and legislation and turn them into global strategies is commendable
Mr Paasilinna 's action plan has very laudable aims in incorporating e@@ Government , e@@ Learning , e@@ Health and e@@ Business
The objective of creating a competitive economy based on information will have a significant impact on growth , productivity , employment and social cohesion in Europe
It is one that I support wholeheartedly and has been much heralded as a main EU priority
However , we need to recognise that progress in this area has been far too slow
We need to make a much bigger impact than we have to date
We need to explore how we can have greater participation and ensure that we do not have a two-speed Europe nor an information under@@ class
I very much support what Mr Paasilinna said
In my area , the West Midlands , many SMEs are looking for this kind of information
However , as Mr Van Velzen said , we need to eliminate the obstacles and create a level playing field across the Union
I have worked in the public sector for a considerable length of time
I am concerned about placing an unreasonable burden on public bodies
Therefore I would urge that there be a provision for a reasonable return on investment
We face a dilemma as , on the one hand , we need to encourage businesses and on the other hand , businesses want information at little or no cost
We have to ensure that these costs do not fall at the door of the public bodies who have an obligation to produce , but have limited scope for manoeuv@@ rability
I also very much support what Mrs Read said on this and would go along with her
The Member States are just now putting the package into effect
This debate cannot be allowed to distort the picture of telecommunications legislation , which would only cause uncertainty for investment in third generation mobile communications
We must help the troubled third generation mobile communications business , not restra@@ in it
The GSM communications business , which has grown considerably in five years , is the cornerstone of our competitiveness and virtually the only thing driving the Lisbon strategy along
Following the disaster over the financial exploitation of third generation mobile communications we have to show we are jointly responsible
The mobile phone industry is a major employer representing the cutting edge of innovation
There has to be a new up@@ swing in the sector; otherwise , the Japanese will leave us behind once and for all
I made a point of investigating the claim regarding an increase in brain can@@ cers in Finland since the 1990s
Whilst the base station network has grown phenomen@@ ally , the figures for cancer in Finland have fallen radically
It is hard to sell d@@ ull facts to the public
In the EU we have prescribed exact limits for radiation which are lower than WHO standards
There is more radiation from mic@@ row@@ a@@ ve o@@ vens than there is from base stations
The values for Spanish operators are as little as one two-@@ hund@@ red@@ th of the safe limit values
However , it is easier to claim that mobile phones mel@@ t our brains
Public documents must be made available in electronic form
Basic information must be free of charge
An authority may make a charge to cover its costs , but it is unnecessary to ask for additional payment
The Member States must be responsible for seeing to it that the public institutions have sufficient resources available to them
Finally , I would like to express my sincerest thanks to the rapporteurs
Have a go , ladies and gentlemen , at using what we are debating here
G@@ o on , c@@ lick on a website - the Council 's , say - go straight to where it says ' Access to documents ' and c@@ lick
You would actually be doing voters a service
They could also get the search functions to work
In the meantime it is also possible to envisage holding Europe-wide referendums with minimal effort and at negligible expense
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , Mr Hans-@@ Peter Martin is right
There are not very many of us in the Chamber
We need search engines that direct people to the right place as quickly as possible on the basis of key words
En@@ tering ' Hans-@@ Peter Martin ' , ' Paul Rübig ' , ' e-commerce ' and ' participants present ' ought to take you straight to this sitting
I think that our world has changed , that the networked society is actually already a reality
It has been possible to complete bureaucratic formalities , conduct business and so on electronically for a long time , but some of the necessary prerequisites are lacking
to what extent has world trade been liberalised ?
We need more competition in the postal services sector
Applying the banknotes system to e-money is something that we are definitely going to need to do in the future
Finally , we also need a Europe-wide investigation into the obstacles to using these new technologies
I would congratulate the European Commission on this proposal concerning the reuse and handling of public sector documents
I nevertheless lament the lack of precision in certain points in the text
I am thinking , for example , of the documents referred to which , in my opinion , are not the subject of a clear , specific definition
As I proposed to the competent committee for content , the concept of a public document needs to be further deline@@ ated
It would also have been desirable to introduce a reference to periods of accessibility of public documents
An order that is harshly enforced poses a risk to the operators concerned
That is why I would encourage you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote for Mr Van Velzen 's report
The rapporteur has successfully supplemented the Commission 's basic proposal with a comprehensive report , which has been intelligently negotiated between the various political groups to which we belong
Mr President , there is no need to insist on the importance today of the information society for everybody , both for the public sector and for companies and citizens
I will focus on just two of the reports under discussion today
We must guarantee that the conditions for access to this information are the same throughout Europe
I would like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative today to present a single system for security of the networks
It is clear that our work and our economies are increasingly based on the information society and it is therefore important to reduce the risk of insecurity on networks
We must guarantee both safe access and the protection of the privacy of the data of those who access the public sector and the networks in general
Mr President , it has been a broad and very interesting debate
I would like to thank Mr Van Velzen for his work on public sector information
We all very much agree that quality is one of the essential factors for the development of the new information society services and particularly 3@@ G services
I would prefer to submit the Commission position on the amendments in writing because the safety at work directive starts with the limits on our working hours
That is a very wise decision
The joint debate is closed
The vote will take place today , Wednesday , at 12 noon
I congratulate Mrs Terrón i Cusí on her work
There are some interesting proposals and advances , in particular increased transparency , a simplification of the procedures and taking more account of the interests of third countries
I regret that these proposals have not been backed up with real figures and that the report has not placed more emphasis on access to citizenship
The first item is the Council and Commission statements on the preparation for the 2003 Spring Summit
In the current political climate , the European Union needs to ensure that it makes good progress on a number of crucial issues at this summit
This will prove that we know how to bolster confidence , security and optimism in Europe
Competitiveness , employment , social cohesion and sustainable development are the tools we shall use to achieve these objectives
We want the March Council to send out a clear signal that , even in these difficult times , Europe is taking decisions which generate momentum and prospects
Having said which , I should like to explain the Greek Presidency 's thoughts and plans and hear President Prodi 's and the European Parliament 's views
Ladies and gentlemen , a great deal of progress has been made since 2000 on numerous issues which come under the Lisbon strategy
However , there are still delays in the application and implementation of a whole series of issues
It is true that we are in the middle of a serious recession
The Spring Summit in 2003 will be held in a new political and economic climate , beset by serious problems but offering more opportunities than in the past
The Greek Presidency understands perfectly that it is more important than ever before to keep the Lisbon strategy on the front burner
This balance will not come about automatically of its own vo@@ lition
The Greek Presidency wants to broaden the economy by adding the social factor and sustainable development
Safe@@ guarding macroeconomic stability and adhering to the Stability and Growth Pact are important means to our end
Again in the tax sector , we are still trying to reach political agreement on an energy tax
The presidency also believes we need to unify the financial markets if we are to improve the Union 's single market
I am delighted to be able to confirm that the two action plans are progressing satisfactorily and we are expecting a progress report at the 2003 Spring Summit
The Greek Presidency endorses the conclusions of the Winter report and agrees that company law needs to be updated , especially on corporate governance
As far as takeover bids are concerned , we hope to make substantial progress on the proposal submitted by the European Commission
Still on the subject of boosting competitiveness , our efforts will be geared towards inter@@ linking networks and full operational liberalisation of the energy and transport markets
We aim to make it easier to create the right business environment
The Competitiveness Council will meet before the Spring Summit in March in order to do the groundwork on items relating to entrepreneurship and competitiveness
Research , technology , knowledge and education are proving to be key factors in competitiveness , development and quality of life nowadays
Investment in research and technology could be encouraged by adopting a Community patent and developing research into cutting edge technologies , which could also include defence research
More and more Union policies are taking account of the need to develop education systems which respond to the potential of the new economy
Another item which I should like to add to this list and which is currently the subject of debate , is the re-use of public records
As I am sure you know , the Council has yet to reach political agreement here
We are keen to receive Parliament 's opinion on this
Another major issue is employment and social cohesion
The reform of the European Employment Strategy is a very important issue for the presidency
The Spring Summit will address the overall orientation of this strategy , the final objective being to adopt the strategy at the Th@@ essalon@@ ika Summit
We believe that the social pillar of the Lisbon process is every bit as important as economic reform
Our priority is to streamline the Employment Strategy
However , we also need to step up our efforts to create more and better jobs , to reinforce and streamline active employment policies and to encourage entrepreneurship
This is even more important in the current macroeconomic climate
The presidency believes this will make policies more coherent and efficient and increase employment
This is our chance to show the world the Union 's role in protecting the environment and adopt policies that combine development with environmental protection and quality of life
We shall also be examining the proposal for a directive on access to port services at second reading
My statement has covered the basic points and actions relating to Lisbon process issues and the spring Council
I welcome Mr Vladimir Luk@@ in and his colleagues
This strategy is already bringing positive results , but we are still not harnessing the Union 's full potential in terms of growth and innovation
Of course , this phase of the economic cycle is not helping us , as Mr Y@@ iann@@ it@@ sis said , nor is the current international political situation
This continues to have a considerable impact on the overall strategies and individual decisions of enterprises and investors
There is a prevailing sense of insecurity
Clearly , this situation will continue until we are in a new phase that offers brigh@@ ter prospects , which is vital for new business and investment strategies
I am still convinced that war is not inevitable and I continue to hope it can be avoided
by applying strict , stringent controls to the Iraqi dictatorship and , at the same time , maintaining and strengthening the international alliance against terrorism
At this time , we must all strive to find common ground so Europe 's diplomats can take action
No one can predict the consequences of a conflict
If war breaks out , it must mean that all political options have been exhausted
This is a problem which affects us all directly
Yet if Europe fails to pull together , all the individual States will disappear from the world scene
Unless Europe speaks with a single voice , it will be impossible to continue working closely with the United States on an ongoing basis while retaining our dignity
And unless Europe and the United States work together , it will be impossible to preserve world peace and stability
It is the behaviour people see in times of crisis that they remember and take as a model , an example for the future
At such times , trust is won or lost
Indeed , I am convinced that the Lisbon Strategy is the best way , even in the current circumstances , to bring our citizens greater prosperity and greater social cohesion
It is also the only strategy that can bring a strong recovery and ensure these benefits are sustainable for future generations
It is my - and the Commission 's - fundamental task to continue , steadfastly and ten@@ aci@@ ously , to give more impetus to the implementation of our strategy
I know I can rely on the Greek Presidency 's backing in this , as was clear from what you said just now , Minister
The gap between political objectives and legislation I referred to a year ago has now been narrowed to a certain extent , but only to a certain extent
Progress has been made in energy , financial services , the Single Sky and research
We must also achieve satisfactory agreements on the Directives on take-over bids , the prospectus and pension funds
In addition , we need to review the European Employment Strategy
In this regard , the Commission welcomes the proposal put forward by a number of countries for a task force of high-level experts to assist it in its work
At the initiative of Commissioner Diamantopoulou , whom I would like to thank heartily for taking this on , the task force will be set up as soon as possible
Above all , however , we must bridge the gap between Community legislation adopted and its implementation at national level
Europe can meet the challenge of modernisation and innovation and it can show that the European economic and social model is a model example for the world
Those objectives , however , cannot be met without far-reaching changes in our societies
F@@ ar-@@ reaching changes that call for political decisions , a shared outlook and rules
Each year 's Spring Council is also a time to look at the economic strategy , what we call the governance of Economic and Monetary Union
We need to explain that these instruments , together with the Stability and Growth Pact , form a coherent and effective whole
This is the aim of our recent proposals for a new interpretation of the criteria for applying the Stability Pact
This interpretation pays more attention to the different economic situation of each country and the need to finance the reforms planned under the Lisbon Strategy
Lastly I feel it is important today to stress our action in the field of education , research and innovation as well
This calls for governments to reform their regulatory and tax frameworks to eliminate the obstacles to establishing and developing enterprises
Encouraging changes in the way research is organised and opening it up is the basic aim of the European Research Area
Ex@@ plo@@ iting the advantages that a shared vision - a genuine common research culture - can bring in universities and enterprises is vital to this end
Our national education systems may differ widely but they are all faced with clear challenges , and these can only be met if we tackle them together
Thus , the work programme on the matter up to 2010 needs to be implemented quickly and coherently to make our education systems more effective and more coordinated
That means we must invest better and invest more in research and education
According to the Lisbon Strategy , we have to be world leaders
In order to be world leaders , we have to have the best brains in the world
We will only be able to attract the best brains in the world if we have major research centres which are the best in the world
This too is a goal we ourselves set
Therefore , either we change the goals or we must endeavour to pursue them consistently
we said 3 % , and 3 % means 3 %
There is no leeway
Lastly , it is not just a matter of spending more but of spending better , as regards both research and education
I would point out that we cannot afford to let one young person out of five abandon their studies without obtaining a qualification
These are human resources which are a drain on our society
This means we must rethink the way we prepare our young people for the labour market and the world of industry , which are growing tougher by the day
Unless we take these practical steps , we will not be able to make up for the lost time we regret
Building a knowledge-based society is the only way to become a world leader
Firstly , how to restore confidence in the Lisbon strategy and how to improve the efficiency of its implementation
Mr President , that is at the very heart of the matter
I also think that now is a good time to make this analysis , because the realisation of the Lisbon objectives is under very great strain
My group therefore welcomes the evaluation report from the Commission
The report offers insight into the achievements of the Member States over the last couple of years with regard to implementing the Lisbon objectives
I must say , however , that the picture is disconcerting
We see extraordinarily sluggish implementation by the Member States and vast disparities in implementation
That also means that the credibility of the Council with regard to the implementation of Lisbon has taken a tremendous blow
You were not wrong when you said that it is necessary to restore confidence
The@@ rein lies the main problem
It would be good , however , if we could have much more clear-cut agreement on how to proceed with this open coordination
Lisbon is not a one-@@ man show involving only the European Council , particularly if one were to now lay its achievements on the table
Mr President , the economic and budgetary reform process indicated by the Ecofin Council must be continued
We must then have the courage to take daring decisions
Then we must also get the debate on the revision of the pension system under way
A three-@@ pillar system may , in future , put us in a better position to tackle the problem of an ageing population
It is true that a large number of obstacles would then have to be removed
If we argue in favour of more entrepreneurship , we make it possible to achieve that aim of a 25 % reduction
Let us then get down to enacting the European Charter for SMEs , too
Let us also ensure that something is done about the obstacles to the recognition of educational qualifications
If we say 3 % R & D , where is the timetable enabling us to ensure that that 3 % can be achieved by 2010 ?
It is lacking , so it must be put in place
We have been discussing patents for such a long time now
The intellectual elite , says the President of the Commission , must not leave
Indeed so , but how long will it be before a European patent finally appears ?
The credibility of the Council rests on this , and at some stage we must take up a position on it
It should not be the case that it is constantly being blocked by a number of the national ministers
Mr President , the knowledge-based economy is key
We are already three years behind Japan and , by the time we do bring it in , we will be five years behind
That is disastrous in a sector like this
What is important is getting a roadmap , so that we can see , in practical terms , who is going to do what and when
Our Europe does not deserve that
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , Europe has always been successful when it has been ambitious
The euro was one of those ambitions , which is providing increasing benefits for citizens
After thirteen months in actual physical existence , the euro has become the equal of the dollar , and is already the second reserve currency in the world
Since the European Central Bank has been managing monetary policy , the rate of inflation in the euro zone has remained lower than the American and British rates of inflation
Long term interest rates are at an historic low in Europe and lower than in the United States
By pointing out these facts , I am standing against the prevailing euro-@@ scepticism and against the tendency for self-@@ punishment among many of our colleagues
growth has slowed down , some large Member States have mounting deficits and unemployment is rising again
However , which region in the world does not have problems ?
We are told that Europe is suffering as a result of its lack of flexibility and structural deficiencies due to social over@@ protection
American unemployment is higher than in the vast majority of European Member States
What is more , the American unemployment rate does not count the two million Americans of working age who are in prison
This efficiency is reflected in international trade , in which the Union is selling nearly twice the volume of American exports
The United States are accumul@@ ating other deficits
Europe could take over , as long as it equi@@ ps itself with the resources to support its ambitions
The Lisbon Strategy is an ambition that will incite action , but the Member States will have to finally get behind implementing this joint strategy defined in Lisbon and Gothenburg
In this context , Europe needs to rethink its investment strategy
In 1970 , Europe used 4
Now we have dropped that figure to 2
I am of the opinion that stability is essential for fighting inflation and public deficits
It also helps towards defending the purchasing power of the poorest in our societies
However , in order to have greater growth , we need to invest in infrastructures , research and the knowledge-based society
We also need to distinguish between investment expenditure and operation expenditure
Mr President , I will conclude by saying that I have tried to give an optimistic message
However , if war were necessary , we would all have to take another look
We therefore need to work to prevent this war in order to preserve growth and employment
Mr Goebbels , I am sure the logic of that is commendable
Let me remind colleagues that this afternoon we have a two-@@ hour debate on war and peace issues
Mr President , I congratulate the President-in-Office on his speech and wish him well with his agenda
The list of unresolved economic reform issues on the agenda for the Spring Council makes de@@ pres@@ sing@@ ly familiar reading
Ministers were at six@@ es and sev@@ ens over the Stability Pact , having failed to issue early warnings to Germany and Portugal
Res@@ ol@@ ving these issues was proclaimed to be the foremost objective of the heads of state and government
So how much progress have we made , one year on ?
On the Community Patent , which Mr Prodi mentioned - no progress
The best gloss that you can put on the new Ta@@ ke-@@ over Bi@@ ds Directive is that it is ' a work in progress '
Far from improving the situation , the Pensions Directive could actually represent a step backwards if adopted in the form currently advocated by Parliament 's rapporteur
And Germany and Portugal have since been joined by France in the ro@@ gues ' gallery of countries which are falling foul of the Stability Pact
In the midst of this litany of failure , in step Messrs Blair , Chirac and Schröder with another depressing example of let@@ ter@@ box diplomacy
Perhaps a little humility from those three leaders is called for when it comes to economic reform
We are in the third year of the ten-year Lisbon plan to improve competitiveness
The truth is that progress has been disappointing
My group would emphasise in particular the importance of completing the financial services action plan , fostering entrepreneurship and promoting flexibility and adaptability in the labour market
The Commission acknowledges , however , that the lack of up-to-date data still ham@@ pers the detailed study of what is happening in the field of poverty and social exclusion
In fact , I have barely heard mention of those last two words
I think that what we are dealing with is not a new economy but a cyclical one , and we have to take account of this
We are ove@@ restimating the potential of liberalisation and underestimating the Member States ' capacity to implement directives and legislation
We are not seeking the causes of the failure to implement them
Is the EU still on the right track , and travelling at the right speed ?
I think that Mr van Velzen puts it well , and several people have mentioned it
The answer is no
there are too few new jobs
With our twelve million , we can consider ourselves well off , but these jobs are not the result of our policies alone
The number of women , older people and people with disabilities in employment is too low
The path to better jobs is still long , and we have done far too little in the way of the modernisation of the organisation of work
If we look at the environment , we see that nothing has come of the horizontal integration in this policy
I am saying it simply but in the strongest terms
Who is discussing energy tax reforms ?
If we look at the general approach , too , talking of Kyoto or Johannesburg , we see very little progress
However , we need better indicators , et ce@@ ter@@ a
the policy is too one-sided with regard to knowledge and innovation
As an engineer , I am all for the intellectual elite , but we should also look at other developments
In my opinion , we need a thorough evaluation of what we are doing
Mr President , I welcome the positive and pragmatic contributions made this morning by the Greek Presidency and by the Commission President , Mr Prodi
Over the coming weeks , there will be many ministerial meetings to put in place serious preparatory work before EU leaders meet on 21 March 2003
The European Union has a lot of work to do , as recent data presently points towards slow economic development within the Union
Unemployment within the Union stands at 8
I welcome the fact that the Greek Presidency is focusing on the need to create more and better jobs within the European Union
It is clear that the spring European Council meeting will put labour market reforms at the top of its agenda
We must all be conscious of the need to improve the workings of the European employment strategy
The Greek Government is right to guarantee that the social partners in Europe will be involved intrinsically in the process of labour market reform
I have always supported social partnership , which is based on the sensible principle of involving trade union and employer groups in key economic and social reform policy issues
The Greek Presidency is working towards the implementation of the Green Paper on entrepreneurship
This will focus on eliminating red tape which ham@@ pers the day-to-day activities of the 19 million small and medium-sized companies in Europe
It will also entail enactment of the European Charter for small enterprises
We must improve access for small companies to know-how and to finance , and we must simplify our regulatory environment
If the European Union is to become the leading knowledge-based economy in the world , then we must take full advantage of all new information technologies
We must guarantee universal access to new telecom services for all the citizens of the Union and we must put in place adequate training and educational programmes for all users
The implementation of the EU initiative and the adoption of a Community-wide patent system are certainly concrete measures that must be supported
The Greek Government is rightly pushing all the Member States to put in place innovative structures which will fully guarantee the payment of future pension policies
Fortunately , as a society , we are living longer and that is why our governments must plan for the demographic changes for the future
We have still not received a reply
President Giscard d' Estaing has refused another request to scrutinise documentation on the grounds that EU rules on transparency do not apply to him
The word ' constitution ' appears 32 times in the first 16 articles
It must now be clear even to those least quick on the uptake that a constitution , and not merely a constitutional treaty , is being worked on
I should like to call for the Pra@@ esidium to be re@@ constituted and made more representative of EU citizens
All the political groups should be represented
Thank you , Mr President , even though there is not very much to say thank you for
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , allow me to return to the Spring Summit
In actual fact , it seems increasingly less cons@@ ol@@ atory seeing as , three years later , very little headway has been made towards attaining that objective
A letter addressed to the Greek Presidency is already doing the rounds , reaffirming the need and desire to revitalise the European economy through ambitious structural reforms
We would do well to ask ourselves whether these models are , today , really capable of protecting society 's most vulnerable , society 's ' outsiders '
We now move to the ' Cat@@ ch the Ey@@ e ' procedure
Colleagues , I remind you that you have two minutes ' speaking time
If you stick to your time we can maximise the number of participants
Mr President , I would like to thank the President-in-Office for his excellent and encouraging remarks and the determination to make Lisbon happen
Lisbon is certainly very much about competitiveness
It is very much about jobs
Jobs will create greater prosperity and , therefore , in turn more social cohesion
Yesterday I clas@@ h@@ ed briefly with Commissioner Diamantopoulou at Question Time on the atypical workers directive
I do not wish to revisit the various points made there , except to say that I would like to clear up a misunderstanding which is relevant to this debate
And I mean ' decided to reduce ' already , as a direct result of the proposed atypical workers directive
The suggestion from the Commissioner , possibly because of the interpretation , was that this was to do with the costs of insurance
It was directly linked to the costs of extra pay for the temporary workers and , moreover , the costs of the extra red tape involved in employing temporary workers
As a result of that , thousands of workers will lose their jobs
If that happens just in one council , it can happen throughout the European Union
I also wish the current Presidency-in-Office well at the extraordinary summit next Monday
I hope that it can establish a common position for the European Union in the present very fraught situation
By this I mean both the targets they agree to under the Lisbon Process and the implementation of those targets because there is a clear gap in the implementation process
I should like to re-emphasise a point made by a number of Members
The Lisbon Process is not simply a liberalisation process - important as that is
The whole idea of the Lisbon Process was to have a coordinated and well-balanced social and economic approach to modernising the European social model
That is also essential - not just from the point of view of social justice but also for creating a more productive Union
We have to ensure that those who are engaged in production feel it is worthwhile for them and for their children
Therefore , the crucial role of public services has to be defended
My final point is that we must set targets for youth employment , in particular for disadvantaged youth
They are the long-term unemployed of tomorrow
Mr President , implementation of Internal Market legislation at national level is an absolute prerequisite for achieving the Lisbon objectives
The increase in the implementation deficit is causing EU markets to spl@@ inter and is eroding the benefits of the Internal Market
Unless the directives on telecommunications , for example , are implemented in the Member States , that sector 's development will be become more dis@@ harmonious than ever
In order to maintain our competitiveness it is vital that we increase resources for research and training
We will not succeed in the future with just bulk products and a poorly trained workforce
Let taxation in future fall within the competence of the Member States
I would also encourage Member States to lighten the tax burden in parallel with the Lisbon objectives so that they take account of fair and positive tax competition
The EU 's task in this area will be to compile comparable data and propagate best practices
This applies to equality between men and women , the progress of social harmonisation , maintaining and developing public services , establishing sustainable development , etc
Ladies and gentlemen , whatever some people think , the old liberal recipes have failed
So yes , we need to make full employment almost the sole objective of the Union
I sincerely believe that it is vital for our future , which is why I wanted to say it again here , this morning , seriously and forcefully
In so doing , the European Union makes itself look ridiculous and the Council is not meeting its responsibilities
The most important reason is that we , as a Union , tolerate the failure of the Member States to honour the commitments they have entered into
In so doing , we have achieved the opposite of what we intended
The countries that have carried out liberalisation are being punished for their good behaviour
We have to see to it that countries honour the commitments they have entered into
This means commitments that are honoured instead of more targets
This means less detailed legislation and more framework legislation , so that people are not hampered in their activities by unnecessary red tape
It is not just the Lisbon process but the credibility of the whole Union that is at stake
Mr President , I will begin by responding to the comment from Mr Bushill-Matthews
Firstly , Bir@@ ming@@ ham City Council is a Labour council , not a socialist council
More importantly , his comment raises many questions about the current employment practices of councils within the UK
So there is a win-win situation
Since Johannesburg , private companies have been seen as a means of delivering government policy
President Prodi said this in anticipation of the debate that we will have this afternoon on the situation in Iraq
A climate of international tension is always damaging to the world economy and is one of the major results expected by the terrorist organisations behind that tension
In particular it will involve evaluating the efforts made by the Member States and by the European Union in education , training and also research and development
I would like to conclude by encouraging President Prodi for his initiative in presenting a plan to simplify European legislation , of no less than 90 000 pages
This initiative is more than welcome in order to make life easier for business and therefore to increase the competitiveness of the Union
This plan aims to reduce the acquis communautaire to some 25 000 pages between now and 2005 and simplify the language in draft legislation
I do not think that anyone will complain about that
It is at this point that I would like , again , to appeal to the private business sector to step up private investment
The European Parliament , as co-legislator , is prompt in doing its work , and it would be a good thing if the Council could keep up with us
Mr President , the Greek President-in-Office gave us a se@@ duc@@ tive list of all the things he was working on
One hundred priorities on a list means there are no priorities at all
I want to echo what Mrs Randzio-Plath just said
It would be refreshing - in fact essential - for the Economic Summit , when it meets on 21 March , to set down what its real priorities are
If we do not get investors behind that , President-in-Office , how are we to deliver all the other promises on your long list ?
It would also be refreshing - and , as you said , innovative - to find ways to activate the European Charter for small enterprises
It would not take much innovation to talk about it for once and actually implement it
President-in-Office , we are witnessing an absurd situation where a simple mutual recognition measure of sales promotion is blocked in your Council
Show us the message , take away the clu@@ tter , get down to business and priorities , come back here and then we will feel you have delivered something
Let us have an end to the la@@ und@@ ry list economic summit
If there is a triangle , services of general interest are the bar@@ y@@ centre of it
Let us think about that and look at how our European policies are operating today
Where is the evaluation ?
Where is the framework directive for services of general interest ?
Where are our proposals to strengthen Article 16 of the Treaty , particularly regarding the resources and tasks of these services of general interest ?
Frankly , I think that this is a very important indicator that we need to use and take advantage of for the years to come
Mr President , the executive difficulties , together with the potential of the Lisbon Strategy , lie principally in its comprehensive , integrated nature
I therefore applaud the fact that , in the Convention , the possibility of granting it constitutional status seems to be gaining support
We therefore need to ensure that all interested parties are persuaded to adopt innovative and responsible practices , by including them in medium and long-term out@@ looks
Mr President , I am sure that it is clear to everyone that the Lisbon process is not yet finished
I think that there are two reasons for this
The first is to do with Lisbon itself
Back then , we took - as we , particularly , do now - as our starting point scenarios based on excessively high growth rates
I think that too many people think that growth is something that you can simply write in a book and it just happens
Secondly , of course , all kinds of promises were made , and they have not been kept
This has also been pointed out enough times
One of the things you spoke about , Mr Prodi , was the takeover bids directive
That is one example that I would like to give
There is a great deal of talk about employment effects
In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs , we have been looking into the probable employment effects of this takeover bids directive
The Commission itself did not look into that
Things often do not turn out as one would think
Another point I would draw attention to is the figures
Finally , a good deal has been said about cooperation in the field of universities
I think that a lot more can be done without us encro@@ aching on the sovereignty of the Member States in this respect
I should like to put one question to the Presidency , however
Can an end not be put to this ?
I know that this is a Greek responsibility , but perhaps some thought could be given to it during your Presidency
We should initiate a major debate and large awareness campaign throughout the Union on this subject
I would call for an incentive to be considered for small-@@ sized business combinations , especially in circumstances where there is little inclination to plan and make arrangements together
I should like to thank President Prodi for again emphasising research and education , as is his won@@ t , and their importance within the Lisbon process
We started out with great expectations of the Lisbon process
However , in education , research , lifelong learning and training , it does not appear to be delivering the goods
We talk a great deal about training , but the private sector only invests 2
3 % in training and progress with investments in lifelong learning , school-@@ leavers and immigrant groups does not , unfortunately , give us cause for optimism
All this is taking place in a climate which discoura@@ ges university researchers and teachers because decisions are not followed up with the practical policies needed
Education and training are not , unfortunately , at the top of the agenda , not even the Lisbon agenda
But we still believe they must remain at the heart of the policies , as they were formulated when the Lisbon process was first designed
Sustainable development and the environment are just as important as the economy and social performance
The European Commission should prepare a sustainability report each year , and the joint resolution requests that the European Commission do just that
they are already avail@@ able; but not in Europe
We are lagging behind in this field
The widespread use of fuel cell cars , powered by biomass , will also mean that wars over oil will be a thing of the past
Environment , social aspects and economy are each of equal importance
It is a great shame that by no means all Heads of Government have taken this to heart
Mr President , we are living not only in a knowledge-based economy but also in a post-@@ Kyoto carbon economy
Those who are able to produce goods whilst producing the least emissions will be the winners in this new economy
They will therefore be able to gain advantages in terms of employment and in economic and environmental terms
This is particularly important because it will lower the financial cost to Europe of complying with Kyoto by 35 %
We cannot , however , resolve Kyoto merely through industry and energy
The Commission needs to come up with initiatives for the transport , farming and energy sectors
We also know that the United States are currently waging a campaign in Russia against the Kyoto protocol
Mr President , I would like to concentrate on research and the creation of the European research area , both through the framework programme and through coordination of national policies
I attended an interesting benchmarking conference in Greece on research and technology
Let me tell you about some of the areas where people looked in detail at the performance of different Member States
Regarding women in science for example , countries like Spain , Portugal and Italy are turning out excellent women scientists and engineers , but other countries are doing very badly
When it comes to persuading young people to enter science and engineering , Nordic countries are doing well , as they do in a lot of categories
Others are doing poorly
This is a crisis across Europe
In terms of linking research with regional policy , again Finland is doing well , and Ireland exceptionally well but other countries are not
Represen@@ ting Cam@@ bridge , I am pleased that some prestigious Cam@@ bridge institutions are now looking to South Yorkshire as a suitable location for research infrastructure
Some countries do well in clu@@ stering
The more we do of this comparison and the more we learn the lessons of the comparison , the more likely we are to keep our New Year 's resolution
I will try harder on mine if Member States try harder on theirs
Mr President , clearly the crisis currently plagu@@ ing the European Union and the capitalist system as a whole will not be remedied with the measures proposed for the spring Council
If anything , they will make it worse
The objective is to redistribute the markets and control energy resources as part of the USA 's master plan to rule the world
Even the European Union and other international economic organisations admit that their liberal policies have been a total failure
Under@@ lying stagnation and falling production and development can no longer be turned around by stability pacts
Mr President , the fact that my seat is directly opposite yours has not helped me to attract your attention from the start , but never mind
We have to synchronise the two systems , we have to synchronise the two reforms , we have to synchronise the labour market and welfare systems
I say to colleagues who have indeed caught my eye , but who are getting anxious about my catching their eye , that it is simply a question of sequ@@ en@@ cing
I hope to be able to call everyone who has indicated their wish to speak
That is why the decision to place skills and innovation in the frontline of the strategy at the Spring Summit is a welcome one indeed
The Commission communication is urging Member States to increase investment in skills and innovation over the next twelve months
This is a good start , but there has to be long-term investment in training
A solid skills base will not be built in a year
Public expenditure for training and education has remained virtually unchanged in all Member States in recent years
Soci@@ eties which try to make use of the whole nation 's resources , based on a policy of equality , achieve great things
Training is the most important factor when it comes to employing people
The share of the population that works has increased in the last ten years
Since 1996 , for example , 12 million jobs have been created
Most of these have been in sectors that require further or higher education
Education and training policy is the responsibility of the Member States , but we can enhance it though cooperation at EU level
The ministers for education have agreed on some common targets for education and training systems
The imbalance between men and women in the areas of mathematics , technology and science must be corrected
Because many pensioners are worried and cannot sleep either
Pensioners agree with having accounts that balance - and what well-balanced accounts they are - but some of them only have their pension to live off
Can we be reassured - and therefore sleep peacefully - that cuts will be made , as is only right , but that this will be done wisely ?
Mr Fatuzzo , I am very sorry to hear that you cannot sleep at night
Mr President , quite a lot of criticisms have been made of the Lisbon Process
At the same time , we must not underestimate the fact that it has done quite a bit of good
We have low growth , and unemployment has certainly stopped falling , but we are coping much better than we did in the nineties
Might it be that economic coordination and monetary policy are playing a role ?
That is what I , in any case , believe
At the same time , I believe that the Lisbon Process must be reformed
The process needs to be better coordinated
It needs to hang together properly , and more focus on implementation is required
In this connection , it is important for us to see these three parts of the process as being of equal value
It is also important that there should be balance in the Lisbon Process
I come from Sweden , a country that is used to implementing structural measures
If the Lisbon Process does not strike a balance between the structural measures , the employment strategy and sustainable social systems , it will fall apart and fail
It is therefore important that this balance be maintained
In conclusion , I want to say something about sustainable development
This affects the whole area
Sustainable development has to do with the environment too , however
In Gothenburg , however , the Union had taken a big step in that direction by announcing its desire to measure sustainable development through the Spring Council meetings
Having heard your speeches , I am forced to admit that once again , this Spring Council meeting will not achieve that objective
Sustainable development is not part of the European plan , a chapter among others , as it was portrayed
Sustainable development implies a new approach to all our European policies , which would involve social and environmental issues as well as the economy
have you analysed the Union 's policies in the light of these new criteria and , in particular , environmental criteria ?
We would like to know how environmental and social issues are reflected in your proposals
What are the consequences of an economy that we want to be the most competitive ?
We are aware today of the financial cost of that social and environmental damage
So please , do not make this Spring Summit just another summit , but an innovative one
Mr President , everyone talks about everything , and no one - or almost no one - sets a limit upon the number of tasks
Most Members add further dimensions
More and more tasks and policy areas are given priority
There is a need to focus upon education , research , development , competition and small businesses
At the same time , more stringent monitoring of state subsidies is required , as well as a review of the rules governing regional aid
Confidence in the European business climate is undermined by short-sighted financial aid that is hostile to development , causes distortion and ham@@ pers competition
These matters must be reviewed , the number of tasks selectively reduced , and action taken
We do not need any more fine-@@ sounding declarations
They are nice to listen to , but it is action that is now required
This means that it is not possible for us to impose any binding obligations , nor can we monitor what is done
What matters is that there should be binding targets , which the Member States have to achieve
I might add that this encourages renewed investment and creates jobs
It makes it a symbol of the unity of Europe , at a time when this unity is being severely te@@ ste@@ d; perhaps even a symbol of hope
It also puts the question of public utility services on the right footing
Then there is the whole issue of modernising the markets and not tying companies down in more red tape
And of course , one issue which is extremely important when it comes to unifying the markets is the unification of the financial markets
From this point of view , 2003 is a milestone in the Lisbon programme
We also need to complete the legislation unifying the transport marke@@ ts; perhaps the Commission could tell us if it is optimistic about at least keeping to this deadline
The prime ministers also emphasise the need for high levels of employment
It is worth remembering that Lisbon talks of full employment , not high levels of employment , and we should stick to our original ambition
Then , of course , there is the question of investments
This optimism is sorely needed
I see the Lisbon strategy as being Europe 's response to globalisation
What is known as the eco-@@ social market economy is the European regulatory model
We must stop apportioning blame
We must make it clear where responsibilities lie - who is responsible for meeting what target and by when
We need definite targets rather than woolly statements
In which areas do we want to be Num@@ ber One and by what date ?
Who has to achieve what subsidiary goal and by when so that the jointly determined European objectives might be fulfilled ?
There is no contradiction between the Stability and Growth Pact and the Lisbon strate@@ gy@@ ; on the contrary , without the Pact , the Lisbon strategy could not be fulfilled
It represents an attempt to demonstrate their unity once more and to set the tone for the debate at the summit
It is an insult to the equilibrium and depth that characterise the Lisbon process , which we have now been working on for three years
I took particular exception to a passage concerning the Har@@ tz Commission
That brings to a close the ' Cat@@ ch the Ey@@ e ' part of this debate
The social repercussions of possible military intervention in Iraq and its impact on the European economy are giving great cause for concern
Just what is it within the Union that ties it to outside developments ?
For example , there has been too little progress towards the objective of sustainable economic development , more and better jobs and greater social cohesion which we set in 2000
We therefore need to review what has been done and examine everything left on the to-@@ do list , especially in the Member States which have fallen short
Without scientific and technological progress and innovation we shall be unable to meet the challenges - the nutritional , medical , environmental and socio-economic challenges
Science and technology are the key to dealing with the major problems that beset human society
This has always been a basic element in the history of man and it still is today
Scientific , technological and related research , education and training are therefore non-negotiable
We know from former Presidents of the Council that finding the courage to break with ritual is perhaps the hardest thing of all
Let me give two reasons why I think it essential that you summon up the courage to do this
What we learn from an un@@ var@@ n@@ ished depic@@ tion of the situation is that investment , both private and public , in Europe is at a low point
We have to take especial note of the fact that public-sector investment is collapsing in those economies on which a major part of our economic development depends
This is where ritual in@@ vocation of the Stability and Growth Pact is not enough
When will we at last affirm our belief in the golden rule and put fresh wind and impetus behind increased investment in Europe ?
This question demands an answer , and soon
You are in a position to do this , and you can get it done
There is a second aspect that seems to me to be of great importance
W@@ onder@@ ful papers are produced on active ageing
These people are the future of Europe , and we force them into unemployment
This is an urgent problem , and I do not find anything like enough about it in our papers
Firstly , on assessing the results so far since Lisbon , we observe that , rather than making progress - at least in relative terms - we have moved backwards
If we compare the levels of productivity in the European Union and in the United States we see that the European Union comes out worse
We believe that this is because we have not been able to make sufficient progress on a framework favourable to business initiative for investment
I therefore hope that rather than making great declarations , the Brussels Summit will fulfil its commitments
At worst , it has not made any headway
As far as sustainable development is concerned , there has been a huge delay
We should already be fully monitoring and developing the outcomes of Johannesburg
I think that both the word and the town have been forgotten
This letter calls for reform , but reform in the wrong direction
The letter d@@ it@@ ches the term full employment and talks of high levels of employment
I have nothing against consultation , but what will you do about the legislation on chemicals ?
What will you do about the new legislation on environmental responsibility ?
In one sense , these laws are restrictions which come within the context of sustainable development and so on
Will they too be left out of the equation ?
I think an answer is required
In all events , a clear answer is required
However , a number of questions need answering , Mr President
Have you thought about re-@@ tabling a general reduction in working times in order to create more jobs ?
About funding the development of the so-called third sector ?
Have you thought about re-@@ tabling all this in the light of the failures so far ?
That is why we have made a conscious decision to support integration in place of confrontation , unity in diversity , and world development in place of dominance
And so we have brought about the upcoming enlargement of the Union , but , at the same time , we are confronted with the growth of unemployment
At this time , therefore , we need leadership from the Commission , the Council , Parliament , the EU institutions and the Member States
Member States , regions , local authorities and heads of businesses alike fail to deliver the goods , however
They all sit on top of their he@@ aps of gold , exercising caution and not doing what needs to be done in order to combat this unemployment
Believe me , if we carry out enlargement of Europe with unemployment still hanging over our heads , we will be heading for an utter fiasco
You talk of research - we have failed to bring about a real European policy for this
Our doc@@ to@@ res hon@@ or@@ is caus@@ a still come to our universities to collect their hon@@ or@@ ary doc@@ torates , before returning to the USA to work in very high-@@ performance laboratories
Why are we doing so lit@@ tle@@ ; why are so many countries lagging behind in terms of research ?
If sustainable development is to be possible , each country must do more than it is currently doing , and together we must do more than we are currently doing
On top of that there is also cyclical unemployment
Have we not been f@@ ob@@ bed off in that regard with nice summits and fine words for long enough now ?
I hope that now , some action will be the result
It is seriously weakened on both counts , to say the least
In reality , European policy amounts to very little and even that is very weak
There is not more new Europe than old Europe
There is quite simply no Europe at all
The Mal@@ thu@@ sian policy of the European Central Bank , which has been reiterated enough in this House , is the main cause of European stagnation and , soon , recession
So , Mr Prodi and the Greek President-in-Office , if you hold a Spring Summit , make it worthy of its name
Br@@ ing the European economy out of the monetary winter that it has been plunged into by the policy of the European Central Bank
The proof is the very report that you published on the competitiveness of European countries after the Lisbon Summit
Which are the three countries that come out best , the three countries on the po@@ dium ?
Great Britain , Sweden and Denmark , precisely the countries that did not adopt the euro
They are doing better in terms of unemployment , inflation , debt and competitiveness , than the countries that adopted the euro
So spot the mistake
Your e@@ go will be flat@@ tered , but the result will be seventeen thousand more unemployed each month , as happened again in France last month
This call is welcome , because today we look more like an old Europe falling into a de@@ pression
However , the main responsibilities lie with the Member States , and the European Union needs to help them better in several areas
For example , firstly , we need to ensure that standard European rules do not make the existing rules more inflexible
That is undoubtedly what is happening with the euro
Let us not repeat this type of error too much
In particular , let us preserve flexibility and truly open economic and social co-ordination , in other words not cover@@ tly proposing standard solutions to everyone
Secondly , we need to stop the Convention moving towards a super-State , which would be cumbersome and restrictive
In particular , we need to entirely reject the European tax that is looming , which would further increase our compulsory contributions , either straight away or later on
Thirdly , the European Union must help the Member States to only take in immigration that is useful on the labour market
In@@ flu@@ xes of immigrants of every category are weighing too heavily on our public finances and on the workings of our societies
Yes , we need to help the poorest people more , but we need to do it where they are , and in our mutual interest
In this respect , the Commission needs to radically change its policy , as I said yesterday when discussing the Terrón i Cusí report
Fourthly , the Union must defend our interests more forcefully on the international scene
On the contrary , if we want to gently reduce budgetary support , at the same time we need to strengthen the Community preference
The Member States need to make greater efforts for reform , that is true , but the Union needs to support them and not make their task more difficult
It seems to me that the entire debate can be summarised in three key words , three key messages
The first is confidence , the second is action and the third is balance , the European model
This is an aspect that , I think , mainly has to do with economic and social affairs
However , I think that , especially in today 's circumstances , questions of confidence do not arise solely from decisions relating specifically to Lisbon matters
Everyone is waiting to see what decisions we , as the European Union , are in a position to take
Greece , not as the presidency but as a Member State , is one of the countries that wants us to move in this direction
The second point I noted from the debate and want to highlight is the real need for action
We do not need new objectives , we need to implement much that has already been decided
Everyone realises this , the presidency realises this , the Council also realises this and we are working in this direction
I should like to comment on another basic Lisbon issue , to do with balanced policies
I really do believe that Lisbon is one of Europe 's many responses , and a very serious response , to the issue of globalisation
The whole core idea of Lisbon revolves around the key word of balance , balanced policies
What we have to decide , of course , is how we can strike a balance between policies to strengthen competitiveness and policies to strengthen the social dimension
The success of post-war Europe has been built on its ability to find a satisfactory answer to the question of balanced policies
We cannot compare Europe with other models without thinking about it very carefully and setting certain limits
We can use benchmarking in each country to see where we were before and where we are now
No country has fast rates of growth and social protection and sustainable development and environmental protection all at once , meaning that any benchmarking is flawed
U@@ se@@ ful yes , as long as you are aware of its very narrow limitations
We know what the price will be if we ignore the demands of competitiveness
So we are forced to proceed in the direction of key factors that currently strengthen the competitive potential of our economy
Otherwise we shall achieve nothing
However , we also know what the repercussions may be if competitiveness is our only criterion or if employment , or social protection or environmental protection are our only criteria
Numerous speakers rightly raised issues to do with employment and employment arrangements
One of the hardest problems is how to tread the fine line between the need for flexibility and the need to strengthen competitiveness and job standards and protect workers
These are the values we have always known in Europe and these are the values we want to safeguard
No one objective takes precedence
We believe that it will be able to find a new answer to these issues in this new , difficult phase
One speaker pointed out or , if you like , criticised the fact there is no specific emphasis on sustainable development or the environment
I should like to start by reminding you that it is Europe as a whole that has put the emphasis on environmental issues
We in Europe have done this , which is why we are critical of other countries which have not signed the Kyoto agreement and so on
Of course , we still have a great deal to do in this direction
Issues arising from enlargement are important in relation to the Lisbon strategy
This is a new challenge for everyone and , of course , for several presidencies , not just the Greek Presidency or this spring Council
I shall close with the letter received by the presidency from the three leaders already referred to
This is one contribution and we want to examine it
We have had contributions from other Member States which have not perhaps received as much publicity
I am looking in the direction of Mr Prodi , the President of the Commission
I had been told that you would not be speaking today
Is that still the case , or do you want to say something after all , Mr President ?
Just a brief thank you because Mr Y@@ iann@@ it@@ sis has already replied in such a thorough manner and we are in complete agreement
I would just like to emphasise the tone of this debate which has been , I would say , characterised by considerable pessimism
It is clear that this is not the best of times , in both political and economic terms
Nevertheless , we have a doctrine and rules which all of us here have endorsed
I can assure you that if we persevere in forging ahead with this doctrine , with these rules , we will not fail to see results
We have created the largest , and I would say , potentially the most efficient market structure in the world
And you will see that results will not fail to arrive soon
I notify the House that I have received six motions for a resolution in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure
Mr President , Chile is a republic which has modified its pension system with measured , appropriate and positive steps concerning workers saving for their pensions through pension funds
This text invites MEPs to give their blessing to an economic agreement between the European Union and the Chilean State
Once again , commercial concerns are being portrayed as acts of generosity
We profess that the new association agreement will breath new life into relations between Europe and Latin America at a time when the region is experiencing serious problems
There is no reason to doubt that those exchanges will be profitable for the big investors of Europe
A few major wealthy Chilean families will continue to become richer , such as those who have made their fortune from wine
But making those few people richer will not in any way benefit the general population
The agreement also proposes the benefit of cooperation in the fight against terrorism
I am glad that the European Community has succeeded in concluding an association agreement with Chile
It is particularly important in the wine sector to establish clear rules on such important areas as the recognition of designations of origin and production methods
Among other things , the agreement includes a comprehensive list of all European designations of origin to be protected in Chile as soon as the agreement enters into force
Such designations could give consumers the wrong idea about the wine 's true origin , all the more so as the words are French rather than Spanish
It is not only about a neutral agreement with Chile , a country where the same language is spoken as in Spain and which deserves support after sha@@ king off dictatorship
It seems to be yet another fisheries agreement in disguise
Under those circumstances , I think that an agreement of this kind is premature , to say the very least
This measure , combined with others already adopted by the Commission such as setting catch limits for Dis@@ sostichus sp@@ p
fishing , encourages closer monitoring of the fight against the scourge that is the unregulated and undeclared illegal fishing of these species , which have considerable commercial value
I am referring to the decisions taken within the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tun@@ as
In fact , material and political investment in the new Information and Communication Technologies is becoming an increasing priority
It is therefore crucial to look more closely at this sensitive field and to invest in it more appropriately
Mr President , on behalf of our group , I wish to make a declaration of vote on the Ca@@ ver@@ i report
I wish to thank the interpreters for their excellent translation of what was far from being a straightforward text
Mr President , whilst I otherwise hold Mr Ca@@ ver@@ i in high esteem , I wish to make it known that I have voted against his report
I believe that it would , in this case , have been better for Parliament to have taken the Danish compromise into account and not gone beyond it
It is not , in my view , very helpful to tie oneself down to a new line
We have to provide help here as a matter of urgency , and there needs to be greater understanding of this area , which is such a sensitive one
I fell asleep again and in my dream , I saw Austria winning the football world cup in 2006
Because it had the most points
So points are helpful to Austria
This is why I voted for the report
It is for this reason that we have not approved today 's Ca@@ ver@@ i report
This argument is that they become a part of a system to phase out the actual restrictions within a few years
So I cannot vote in favour of the Ca@@ ver@@ i report
This was a difficult compromise to reach , and is the outcome of lengthy negotiations within the committee
Consequently , it has both the advantages and the disadvantages of all compromises
In this context , it is a compromise that is acceptable as a transition towards a definitive situation
This is why I have voted in favour of the report
In that case , I thought , explanations of vote can also be used for commercial exploitation , and I still think so
We are not going to vote against people having access to public sector information
However , although they are in favour of transparency , the European institutions are in favour of public sector documents being used by commercial companies to make a private profit
That is not transparency , it is information to benefit some and misinformation for others
Transparency alone could , in this area , be useful for the whole population , and would force large companies to make their accounts available to all
I have abstained because I am sensitive to these problems , to which I would add the current state of discussions on this matter in my own country
I have voted in favour of the report on the eEurope 2002 action plan
These reports formalise the principles laid down at successive European Councils for ' an information society for all '
The current potential for tele@@ matic transfer and access provided by the Internet , forces us to march in step with progress
The same applies to consolidating democracy and the principles of the rule of law
This matter should remain within the sphere of each Member State because it is dependent on the specific context of that country
Mr President , this report expresses an opinion on the entry and residence of third country nationals for the purpose of paid employment and self-employed economic activities
Are you not going to do something for pensioners as well ?
We too would like to travel throughout Europe , even if we are from third countries and are not workers , just pensioners
Will there be a directive in the future which will facilitate the entry into the European Union and movement and residence therein of pensioners too ? '
Therefore , in the meantime , I voted for this report too
The UK , however , has chosen not to opt into this report , in line with its position on maintaining control over ad@@ missions
For this reason , we have opposed certain provisions that will cause specific problems in the UK
In particular , I refer to Amendments Nos 2 , 55 , 27 and 17 , which we voted against
We in the Moder@@ ate delegation to the European Parliament are well disposed towards the Commission 's proposal , which is a step towards a common EU immigration policy
Our working principle in relation to labour migration is that someone who has been offered a job should also be able to obtain a work permit
Furthermore , we believe that authorities are never better placed than employers themselves to know who is best suited for a particular post
It is important that third-country nationals issued with work permits be able to guarantee they can support themselves during the period that they are resident in the Community
For reasons of subsidiarity , we have also voted in favour of giving the Member States scope to establish quotas and ceilings where labour migration is concerned
More specifically , such centralisation would cause several problems
It would make a system that needs to remain flexible and easily adaptable to the local needs of each Member State more rigid
Such statements at least clarify the hidden intentions of the text
We condemn this policy , which involves centralisation in order to disarm us further , and we obviously voted against it
We have abstained from voting in this vote because of the above-mentioned conflict
She is thus concerned , as is the Commission , with supplying capitalist undertakings with the labour that they need - something that used to be known as slave trading
Yet in addition to this philosophy of destroying even further our national identities and economies , we must bear in mind the fact that the worst is yet to come
Other states will be able to decide for them , and compel them to take measures which are contrary to their own national interests
The proposal contains quite a few constructive elements for improving and simplifying application procedures , as well as for ensuring uniform rights for the persons concerned
Furthermore , Community harmonisation is contrary to the principle of subsidiarity because rules in this area do not in themselves prove any need for harmonisation
The different rules spring from different needs and traditions in the Member States
Europe is becoming less and less open to refugees who have had to leave their countries because their lives and freedom were threatened
On the other hand , there is an ever-increasing need for people pursuing occupations in which there are shortages in Europe
Examples are nursing staff from South Africa , the Philippines and South America , and highly trained chemis@@ ts , physi@@ c@@ ists and mathe@@ ma@@ ticians from India
This proposal extends the permits of those people we , in Europe , consider necessary
Instead , we should be looking a bit more at those who have already become established here , and who hope to be able to stay
39 % of its GDP to public development aid until 2006 - instead of the 0
7 % set internationally a considerable time ago@@ ; because the policies established at the WTO are not benefiting the poorest countries
This has led to the gap between the richest and poorest countries growing , to encompass a further 100 million poor people
It is true that the European Union cannot receive all of the world 's poor onto its territory
In fact , it is impractical ' to take account of the European Union 's labour needs '
I therefore voted against the report
The facts of the matter are very different
This movement did not come out of no@@ where@@ ; it is linked to the struggle by the workers and the working classes and it draws on their experience and messages
I voted in favour of the joint resolution tabled by the Left , which was in line with the social movement and against unbridled globalisation
Our resolution was rejected - but only just - in favour of a Liber@@ al-@@ Conservative text which goes against the demands of those people who demonstrated at Porto Alegre and Davos
Our European Parliament has once again confirmed that the majority of its Members are on the Right
We should not forget this when we come to prepare for the European elections of June 2004
The spread of illnesses such as HIV/AIDS and epidemics in the developing world has taken on genoci@@ dal proportions
Unfortunately , the international community is still addressing this issue with one eye on the interests of the big pharmaceutical multinationals
The European Parliament 's resolution is an acceptable contribution in this direction
I voted against the European Parliament 's resolution on the next round of WTO agriculture negotiations , for two reasons
In other words , the Commission is trying to force our hand
In other words , we would be dismantling Community preference just that little bit more
In order to do this , we would have to remove agriculture from the WTO rules
Once again , the Commission is manoeuvring us , and one can only deplore the approval expressed by the French Government at the General Affairs Council on 27 January
This overlooks the fact that this approach accentu@@ ates food dependency and specialisation based on monoculture for export dominated by the developed countries ' food multinationals
They should also advocate the right of all countries to ban the trade in GMOs
The proposal exceeds the framework of Agenda 2000 , which had already made excessive concessions to the detriment of small and medium-sized family holdings
It should be noted that from the outset this proposal makes the interim review of the CAP a precondition , which demonstrates the hypocrisy of some delegations within the Council
The European Union 's proposal for the WTO negotiations is not compatible with the objectives of the CAP
Mr President , item 66 of the document on European transport policy seeks to improve road safety
That is all well and good , very good , but when will we manage to beat the fog ?
In other words , when will we succeed in seeing through the fog and having fewer road accidents ?
Today , thanks to the progress of technology , we can even see in the dark , with special infra@@ red gl@@ asses
Why do we not spend Europe 's money on better research so that , at last , all motor@@ ists have fog gl@@ asses ?
Mr President , I have voted in favour of this report
In my own country , the issue of the White Paper on Transport is a matter for vigorous debate
One of the White Paper 's proposals is of enormous importance in view of something currently under discussion - the extension of the Austrian ecopoint system
Such a transport infrastructure costs directive will be a criterion against which our credibility and the much-@@ invoked European transport policy can be judged
We welcome the fact that our proposals for a European loan to finance trans-European networks , which are currently at a standstill in the Council , have been included
Increased cooperation on road safety between the EU Member States is very important
A new European authority must not take over decision-making from national , regional and local bodies , but could strengthen cooperation between the EU Member States and promote best practice
We are not in favour of a European transport fund
There is a lot of money in already existing funds that is not used to the full
We are in favour , however , of the proposal to set up an inquiry into the development of new methods for funding major infrastructure projects of common European interest
This proposal is far too detailed
It does not fall within the scope of this report to lay down detailed regulations on speeds
However , we need to be aware of the kind of policy we are talking about
We totally reject this policy , in which the so-called rational organisation of transport is merely a trick
A European transport policy should be based on the public service provided by the principal collective means of transport
Basic public transport services which are absolutely essential to the public should not generate private profits but should be organised on the basis of need
Consequently , we voted against this report
Today , at voting time , there were still ' margins of uncertainty ' regarding the possible adoption of certain amendments , in particular those tabled by the GU@@ E-@@ NG@@ L Group
Those on the Right united against them , very often with the support of the Socialists
I therefore voted against a report which does not respond to the serious issues at stake in terms of regional planning , the environment and social matters
For example , in France there is great diversity between the various landscapes , especially in mountain regions and rural areas
This proposal is lacking in pragmatism and does not take sufficient account of disparities in treatment at local level
In this field , political willingness on the part of governments is sometimes lacking
Improving the efficiency of transport also means paying special attention to trans-European navigable waterway networks
All too often these projects are prevented from being implemented
Finally , I am not in favour of the creation of a European road safety agency
I do not think that we can solve the problems we are currently encountering by multi@@ plying structures of this type
The ELDR Group is in favour of an environmentally friendly plan for traffic through the Alps , but such a plan must support the development of environmentally sound transport
That is not emphasised in the proposal
The ultimate aim is to increase the return on capital
Pro@@ cla@@ mations about safe transport and environmental protection are cancelled out by the philosophy of all-out , unaccountable competitiveness
The report welcomes the fact that a good deal of progress has been made with regard to liberalisation and competitiveness in transport
Using demand as its criterion , it highlights the advantages of road transport and focuses on the creation of high capacity north-south and east@@ -@@ west corridors
At the same time , it insists on the need to privatise the railways as a precondition for making them profitable
It also supports market access to port services and stresses the need for a uniform taxation and costing policy for transport
The Commission and the report are indifferent to the impact this policy has and will have on the standard , safety and cost of transport to the general public
The increasing attention paid to road safety represents added value for Portuguese interests
In fact , the adoption of this report will enable many problems experienced on Portuguese roads , and in particular on some roads in the Al@@ gar@@ ve , to be solved
For all of these reasons I am persuaded to vote in favour on this matter
This report is based on a premise that is good for my country , since it seeks to launch new initiatives to improve access in the outermost regions
It is absolutely crucial that we adopt a realistic approach to this matter
This will be a good way of giving the Transport Policy the solvency and credibility that it needs
These are my reasons for voting in favour of the report
I have voted against the report , which has been adopted by 40@@ 6 votes , with 95 votes against and 33 abstentions
Road safety is a very important responsibility
Every year , many thousands of lives are claimed on European roads
Setting up a further EU authority is no solution , however
What , rather , is required is more stringent monitoring of the ways in which the road traffic regulations are complied with
The EU is weighed down by a significant bureaucracy which sw@@ allows large sums of money
National authorities now already exist with the task of promoting road safety - in Sweden 's case , the National Road Administration in Bor@@ l@@ än@@ ge
Nor can I support the decision to set up a new European transport fund , as approved by 3@@ 68 votes , with 145 against and 13 abstentions
The proposal is in danger of causing Member States with currently high road standards indirectly to be forced to pay money to countries whose roads are of poorer quality
We advocate the responsible liberalisation of European railway management
We support the institutionalisation of a European Transport Fund
Mr President , a key aspect of the roll-@@ out of third generation mobile communications is the protection of children
The mobile revolution could greatly increase their vulnerability to pre@@ d@@ ators
We need strong action and strong recommendations from the Commission in this area
The importance of the precautionary principle should not be ignored either , given possible health problems
What are the effects of electro@@ magnetic waves on the human body ?
Scientific research is continuing in this area
Speci@@ alists are asking questions
It is essential that we consult medical organisations on this question
3@@ G relay ma@@ sts must be posi@@ tioned with due regard for the environment
Third generation requires between 4 and 16 times as many ma@@ sts as second generation
Hence the need for ma@@ st-@@ sharing and for the Commission to take full consideration of the environment in its proposals
Mr President , I am starting to feel the pan@@ gs of hunger so I will not deliver an explanation of vote this time
Let us not wait for another asbest@@ o@@ s-@@ type crisis to make us aware of the dangers that are threatening us
This situation is largely due to the great expectations raised for the sector 's development and to the enormous financial sums obtained by some Member States by auctioning UMTS licences
Consequently , these States are now considering adopting unilateral aid to ' rescue ' this sector from a situation of considerable debt
Mr President , I cannot refrain from delivering this explanation of vote
Mr Sil@@ vio Berlusconi has issued a letter giving money to students to buy computers
I would like pensioners not to be overlooked in this information society
We are all aware that for the European Union to remain competitive we must take full advantage of the new information technologies that are coming on stream
That is the core of the Action Plan for eEurope 2005 guaranteeing widespread availability of broadband networks throughout the EU
It also seeks to ensure the widespread use of the Internet through e@@ Government , e@@ Learning , e@@ Health and e@@ Business initiatives
I represent a peripheral part of the European Union - both the western and border county regions in Ireland
It must remain a central European policy that the benefits of new technologies extend equally to all urban and rural parts of Europe
If access to these new technologies is not available , investors will locate their companies where the best available technology is
On issues such as information technology , there is the principle known as universal access
Despite the fact that there is generally consensus amongst Members on this issue , I think it important to register my vote in favour of this report
I and my fellow British Labour MEPs do not support any amendments critical of the auction system for allocating radio spectrum
It was always clear , from both the Council and the Commission , that Member States had the choice of the system to allocate radio frequencies
The UK quite properly chose the auction system , and we do not concur with the criticism of this contained in these two reports
I have voted in favour of this report , and I agree , therefore , with the conclusions reached by the competent parliamentary committee on its content
The prospects and expectations of Lisbon are , unfortunately , a far cry from the situation on the ground in Europe
We need to restore confidence in the Lisbon Strategy and to implement its aims
In order to achieve this , a roadmap must be drawn up for its monitoring and for legislative commitments to be smoothly transposed into national legislation
In the context of employment and social affairs , the crucial role of the social partners must be emphasised
These measures must also combat undeclared work and poverty and social exclusion
We must furthermore improve the system of the mutual recognition of qualifications , in order to encourage greater and better mobility
We believe that it will have three negative effects in particular
Then we are being sent a sub@@ limin@@ al message which we do not accept , namely that the European Union is a super-state which has its finger in every pie
As I said during the debate , many of the measures proposed are extremely interesting , but we ought to concentrate on certain central selling ideas
The European Union should not add an additional cumbersome and restrictive level of management
A policy which cat@@ ers for the weakest is the hallmark of a civilised human community which has to meet the needs of the weakest too
We must be more mindful of the environment , food security and animal rights , for these are issues related to quality of life
We need to prevent practices such as female genital mutilation which damage physical integrity and personal dignity
Ladies and gentlemen , that concludes the votes
The sitting is suspended
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the situation in Iraq
May I say that I do not subscribe to this view
To my mind nothing , least of all war , is a foregone conclusion
You all know the ins and outs of the Iraqi cris@@ is; there is no need for me to describe it in detail
I should just like to round up a number of recent developments
One , the conclusions of the General Affairs Council held on 27 January , setting out a number of principles behind the policy of the Fifteen on Iraq
Four , President Bush 's announcement of a new Security Council resolution authorising the use of violence
These events which I have picked out are not particularly encouraging
These core conclusions were the main thrust of our demar@@ che to the Iraqi missions in Athens , Brussels and New York
Ladies and gentlemen , one question that arises is the significance of all these recent events in connection with Iraq to an internal dimension of the European Union
I refer to the common foreign policy and defence policy
The time has come when action will show if all these ambitious stands have any real substance or if that is not the case at present
To underestimate them is to mis@@ interpret history
Ladies and gentlemen , the chief international weapons inspectors , Dr Hans B@@ li@@ x and Dr El Bar@@ ade@@ i , returned from recent contacts with Baghdad with a degree of optimism
They are due to submit their next progress report to the Security Council on 14 February and we await it with serious and evident interest
A great deal will depend on what the inspectors have to say in their report
President Prodi referred this morning to the importance of this process
As things stand today , at this particular juncture , it will not be an easy task , but it is a necessary task
I trust that the common values that unite us will make it both easier and more feasible
What are our expectations of the summit on 17 February ?
We also expect a decision on every initiative in every direction which might help bring about peace , de@@ escalate the crisis , disarm Iraq and avoid unnecessary suffering
To close , ladies and gentlemen , we need to answer the question of whether or not we can achieve convergence
My reply is that I do not know if we can , but that we must try , we must find a way
And we must exhaust every possible avenue in order to do so
The credibility of the European Union , its interests , its role and its prospects are at stake
The Greek Presidency considers that these are achievements that must be protected and strengthened
And that applies both to the Fifteen and to the 10 new Member States
We need unity in the European Union
And behind or alongside unity there is solidarity
And solidarity does not just mean the Structural Fund@@ s; it is a horizontal concept
If it is undermined , its ramifications will be crucial for everyone in Europe , for each country individually and collectively for the European Union
What is crystal clear is that Iraq needs to cooperate more willingly and intensively both in form and in substance with the inspectors , if war is to be avoided
Some encouraging signs of cooperation emerged recently , as a result of Mr B@@ li@@ x 's and Mr El Bar@@ ade@@ i 's mission to Baghdad last weekend
We will have more indications on the extent of Iraq 's cooperation next Friday when the chief inspectors report to the Security Council
We are about to face another crucial point as regards whether Saddam is ready to disarm or not
Beyond any possible speculation , it is easy to imagine that we will still be in a somewhat unclear situation open to different interpretations
In any case we have to stick to the inspectors ' assessment , bearing in mind that war must remain the very last resort
The recent resolution voted by the European Parliament expressing its full support for a multilateral approach gave a clear message in this direction
The EU in fact looks weaker and more divided than ever
These differences are not the product of some minor institutional inadequacies in the architecture of the European Union
We already have a High Representative entrusted with the responsibility of speaking on behalf of the European Union
The differences are honest and real , and therefore demonstrate that a more fundamental change is necessary if Europe is to achieve a true Common Foreign and Security Policy
This is a moment of truth
Anything short of qualified majority voting will not be a solution
This lesson should be kept in mind in the present institutional and constitutional debate
It is not up to the European Commission to speculate on hypothetical possibilities or the future course of action
Many scenarios are still possible - including the likelihood of a military attack
Yet our major responsibility at this point is to give absolute support to the Security Council
Needless to say , in parallel , each of us needs to work on what to do in case things do not go as we wish
Let me now turn to the humanitarian aspects of the crisis
The European Commission , through ECHO , is the largest external donor to Iraq outside the ' Oil for Food Programme '
Over the last ten years ECHO has provided EUR 15@@ 6 million worth of humanitarian aid to the population in Iraq
The operations from this funding will run until summer 2003
For 2003 , ECHO has earmarked EUR 15 million to continue this established - more or less ' normal ' - humanitarian operation in Iraq
It is estimated that over 7 million Iraqi people benefit from ECHO 's assistance
Even@@ tual military action against Iraq would further worsen the living conditions of the Iraqi people , and in particular of those of the most vulnerable civilian population groups
A military attack might have humanitarian fall@@ -@@ outs in the whole region , with movements of refugees and also quite possibly negative consequences on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
The Commission is going through studies and analyses right now , looking at contingency measures in case of a conflict
This is in order to be able to react quickly to any change in the humanitarian situation
These missions also looked into the security measures envisaged for relief workers and humanitarian operations - evacuation plans and other such difficult issues
A strict separation must be maintained between military action and humanitarian assistance to make sure that delivery of aid is possible
Humanitarian assistance has its own rationale and objectives
It is based on the needs of the civilian populations and allocated solely in proportion to these needs
Ne@@ u@@ tr@@ ality and impartiality are crucial for having access to populations and a condition sine qua non for the security of relief workers
De@@ li@@ very of humanitarian assistance by or assisted by armed forces is not desirable
It should in any case be closely coordinated and decided by the humanitarian organisations which have the necessary mandate , know-how and experience
These are the guiding principles for our assessments and for our possible action in the area of humanitarian aid if a conflict breaks out
Mr President , on a point of order , we are facing a threat to world peace
This is a most serious situation
If this Parliament is to be relevant , it has to allow more time for all points of view to be expressed
It is unfair that it is limited only to the leading players in Parliament and that ordinary Members do not have an opportunity to contribute
This is our second substantial debate on this subject in recent weeks
I hope that the diversity of opinion in the debates we have will find the capacity to express itself
Commissioner , Iraq is in fact a rich country , but its dictator has plundered it
So anyone who sees the USA as the problem is confusing cause and effect
It is the Iraqi dictator who is the problem
Responsibility for whether it happens peacefully or by military force lies solely with the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein
Let us just remind ourselves of the chron@@ ology of events
At the heart of dis@@ unity within Europe and across the Atlantic is the self-@@ isolation of the Federal Republic of Germany , for which its present Chancellor must bear responsibility
He gave a complete repeat performance in the elections to provincial assemblies , but it brought him no success in terms of votes
We then come to the second chronological element , the Franco-German declaration at the celebrations of the El@@ ys@@ ée Treaty
The French were always much more sophisticated , but that was the political impression that was given
Then came the statement by the eight states
In essence , the statement does meet with our approval , however
It was also necessary in order that we might send out a signal of friendship to our American partners
We are now faced with the question of what is to happen next
I recommend that we give thought to how we understand our relationship with America
If we understand European unity in terms of opposition to the United States of America , then we are building Europe upon sand
Rather than that , we want a partnership between the European Union and the United States of America , a partnership founded on cooperation between equals and on multilateral partnership
There are also , of course , things that we demand of our American partners
The American administration and President Bush should also recognise the value of European unity , which is also in the interests of the United States of America
If we in Europe were to revert to forming axes as we once did , then both our group and I would consider this a perilous road to go down
If Europe were to present itself thus to the world , it would be a night@@ mar@@ ish sight
That is why we have to act within the framework of the Community
All the things we are doing now have to be done on a Community basis
That , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , is why our group supports your decision to call a summit meeting of the Heads of State and of Government
Let me say just a word or two on the subject of Turkey
I hope that we will also achieve a result on this issue
It is to be hoped he will be brought to do this by peaceful means and under the guidance of the United Nations
The European peoples do not just co-exist in the Union , but we share a destiny in bro@@ therhood and mutual tolerance
We all want peace , we are all against blood@@ thir@@ sty dictators and we all want to see the disappearance of weapons of mass destruction
In families - and in the Union - there can be moments of tension , but we must be able to overcome them through solidarity and mutual compromise
The approach which can unite Europe is the mandate of the United Nations , respect for international law and the continuation of the inspectors ' work
We are not condemned to war; we must work to give peace a chance
I would like to correct Mr Poettering on a point relating to the isolation of the current German government
Before that there was nothing more than passivity
Therefore the Schröder government is not isolated , it is in good company
In this regard , it is important to point out that at this time we must not anticipate events
We must not forget that Iraq , despite everything , is still a secular and religiously pluralist regime , which is important in view of the situation of increasing fundamentalism
We have heard the Commission 's report on the humanitarian issue - and I thank Commissioner Nielson - which also points out the risks involved in this
We must therefore carry on supporting the inspectors , insisting that Iraq comply with the resolutions of the Security Council without allowing it to make any excuse or evasive response
In this context , the inspection chi@@ efs have noted that it is a positive step that Iraq has agreed to allow surveillance flights and is cooperating
At the moment , the international community has put is faith in the inspectors
They must continue their work and we must support them
The issue today is not the extent to which we are friends on paper with the United States
We are in disagreement - and this must be said - over the doctrine of preventive war
We are allies of the United States as a result of shared historical responsibilities and principles
We must fight to give peace and hope a chance
But we are now plum@@ bing new depths of public bic@@ kering , with the spl@@ its spreading from the UN and the EU to include N@@ ato
An@@ archy reigns in our international institutions , and that only provides comfort to Saddam Hussein
And if that requires America to show a little patience , that is no bad thing
Democracy can be difficult , and building support for a position often takes time and good arguments
But it is better to take the time to do it and get it right than to launch into a course of action , half co@@ ck
Liberals therefore congratulate the Greek Presidency on convening next Monday 's meeting
We trust that all governments will attend
They should come prepared to listen and to seek common ground , not simply to repeat their well-known positions
Europe 's leaders too should take care not to over@@ play their hand
Given the reservations he expressed last time , Dr Hans B@@ li@@ x 's report on Friday will carry particular significance
At the same time , if he reports progress towards active cooperation , the US and Britain should give the UN process the space to work
A@@ mid all this g@@ loom , perhaps we can take comfort from one ray of hope
When the inspectors report again on Friday , the eyes of the world will again be focused on the UN Security Council
It will be the body which represents the ultimate authority of the international community and considers Iraq 's fate
We should welcome the fact that the UN , established to preserve world peace , is at the heart of the process
Mr President , the European Union is facing a test of truth
In these circumstances , what message should Parliament be sending to the European Council ?
Its resolution of 30 January was clear on the essential points , and is still entirely in line with our current view
First of all I should like to brush aside the insidious remarks of those who have tried to portray us as being under an obligation to Saddam Hussein
On the contrary , even in the opinion of the journalists who were present , ours was the most independent delegation of any in recent times
Well then , what did we see and hear in Iraq , and what collective conclusions have we drawn ?
There is no longer an economy , apart from oil , exports of which have fallen by half due to lack of investment
In rural areas , all activities have collapsed , desertification is progressing and the population exodus is speeding up
one third of the population is suffering from chronic malnutrition , and one third of children are seriously under@@ weight
Inf@@ ant mortality has exploded in the last ten years
More than eight thousand schools are in ruins and need repairs that would now be too costly
Students have no books , and teachers earn the equivalent of a few euros per month
This is the result of twelve years of embargo , and it is absolutely essential to put an end to this unbearable collective punishment
Against this background , now , the predominant feelings are of fat@@ alism , resignation , and silent trauma@@ tisation
A new war would undoubtedly lead to the catastrophic disruption of supplies of food and water
It would be a humanitarian disaster
In our view this reason alone is enough to rule out absolutely any new recourse to war , whatever the circumstances
The other striking experience in our view was our meeting with the spokesman of the inspectors and the director of the UN inspection centre in Baghdad
What they told us makes good sense
First of all , as long as the inspectors are present , it will be difficult for Saddam Hussein to manufacture prohibited weapons
Next Saturday , throughout the world , a ti@@ dal wave without precedent in many countries will rise up and say no to war
Following the events of 11 September , we said that we were allied but not aligned
This handful of Member State leaders who are ready to divide Europe at a signal from the White House needs to be reminded of this principle
We must keep abreast of European public opinion as it emerges throughout the continent
We are , as I said , facing a test of truth
History has not yet been written
Let us hope that those who are holding the cards are able to measure the weight of their responsibility
If the objective really being pursued is that of dis@@ arming Iraq , we must strengthen the inspection programme
The inspectors are the alternative to war
We must therefore confirm , at the Security Council on Friday , that the sole objective of Resolution 14@@ 41 is to disarm Iraq
I would remind you that the resolution adopted by the plenary session of the European Parliament on 30 January is clearly in line with this reasoning
This attitude in no way signifies that we accept the dictatorial nature of the Iraqi Government
It signifies that we do not want a change of regime to be brought about by war
Whatever happens , I am proud of the position adopted by these various governments
I too was a member of that delegation of 31 Members
A new war in Iraq would obviously have catastrophic humanitarian consequences , and this was confirmed to us by all the UN workers whom we met in Baghdad
Is this really how we imagine we are preparing a future for the people of Iraq ?
Mr President , this is an exceptionally important debate
Ten@@ sions are certainly rising in an international context
If we are not careful , and if this crisis is badly handled , this will only result in serious and long-term consequences for us all on many fronts
It would be tragic if the authority of the United Nations is weakened to a point where it loses international credibility
International security is best served in a collective sense , via global institutions such as the United Nations
In many ways , it is even more important for smaller Member States to have their security protected by an international organisation such as the United Nations
This is the crux of the issue
There is genuine good will , support and confidence on the part of the people of Europe in the work of the United Nations
In fact , no one would dispute for one moment the professionalism and integrity of the United Nations officials who are officially involved in the inspection missions in Iraq
The United Nations has been involved in the whole process to disarm the Iraqi Government of its weapons of mass destruction
The United Nations must remain a central player in this ongoing process of disarmament
Weapons inspections must continue as long as the inspectors themselves and the United Nations Security Council believe that they will serve a useful purpose
We all want to see a peaceful solution to this issue by guaranteeing the compliance of the Iraqi Government with United Nations Security Council Resolution 14@@ 41
Saddam Hussein must recognise that the international community wants to resolve this issue by peaceful means
Dis@@ arming Saddam Hussein in a peaceful manner is by far the most acceptable and preferable course of action for all of us
EU governments are meeting next Monday to review the political situation
This meeting is taking place at a time of rising tension between the different European Union states
I certainly hope that this meeting can and will be used to defuse this tension which simply serves no one 's interests whatsoever
This meeting will take place only a few days after the next United Nations weapons inspectors ' report is published
We must all try to approach the next few weeks collectively in a calm and reasoned manner
However , Saddam Hussein must not be allowed to de@@ fy the authority of the United Nations as he has sought to in the past
We must not forget that this is a man who brutally abuses the human rights of his people
He has used chemical weapons on his own peop@@ le; he has invaded Iran and Kuwait and bombed Saudi Arabia and Israel in the past
This is certainly a track record of brutal belli@@ ge@@ rence
Saddam Hussein needs to be dis@@ armed , and he must recognise that the international community will continue to demand that he does disarm
The mutual damage inflicted across the Atlantic over the past few days has benefited neither the Iraqi population nor international security
In fact , only the current terror regime in Baghdad stands to gain from it
And then we talk about a potential neighbour of the European Union , in view of Turkey 's candidate status
This political option prompts me to put a couple of questions to the Greek Presidency
Sooner or later , a new policy of containment towards Saddam Hussein will do the international community , and therefore the European Union , too , serious harm
I presume that Turkey , too , has been invited to next Monday 's European crisis deliberations on Iraq
According to international press reports , the candidate countries are also receiving an invitation
Is the Council also intending to raise the Kurdish question , a crucial factor in the Iraq crisis , with Turkey at these deliberations ?
I assume , Mr President , that the Council is not divided on conserving Iraq 's territorial integrity
That person is Saddam Hussein
The alternative is politics , and it is the role of politics to define what kind of peace , what kind of conditions , what kind of rules
You see , you are incapable of doing anything except m@@ umbling ' peace '
And what does that mean , pray ?
You will go out in your millions to demonstrate for peace and Arab public opinion will see you as supporting Saddam Hussein , whether you like it or not
That did not happen , and just look at the chaos
I hope that , at the European Council , this single proposal , which has now been signed by thousands of people , will be the only point of convergence
I believe it can enable us to regain some of our lost dignity
Mr President , the problem of Iraq is a Gor@@ dian knot which needs to be cut with the greatest possible consensus within the international community
Terrorism is a running sore , which may flare up if moves are made without the backing of the Security Council
We all know that this international crisis has been provoked by Iraq 's failure to comply with the resolution in question
In addition , Iraq is being governed as a dictatorship , with no respect for human rights or democracy
The European Parliament has led the way in the defence of human rights and fundamental freedoms and cannot therefore tolerate this situation
The second point I want to make is that we must first exhaust every peaceful and diplomatic means of getting Iraq to comply
International peace and security need to be safeguarded and action taken at international level must not undermine the credibility of the UN or the Security Council
Military action against Iraq must , of course , be the final solution and it must be sanctioned by the international community on the basis of the inspectors ' report
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I think it would be a very good thing if we really could find a common position on the points you have set out
They are also the essential points of the resolution adopted by this Parliament on 30 January , with which you are no doubt well acquainted
I would like to take a close look at these four points
The removal of all weapons of mass destruction from Iraq is not at issue
Where we will have difficulties , and where it is important that we be clear in our own minds , is with the maintenance of the UN 's primacy
We also have to make clear our opposition to unilateral courses of action and , most certainly , our opposition to a preventive war
There are many possibilities for this
The latest proposals put forward in Europe point in this direction
There is one point I would like to address and one pre@@ f@@ atory remark I would like to make in order to make Mr Poettering 's speech comprehensible
This House is perhaps not aware that we had elections in Germany on 22 September last year
They were won by Gerhard Schröder and not by Mr Sto@@ iber
He can carry on believing that , but I do not believe that this House is particularly interested
We have quite different problems with which we should be getting to grips
One of those problems is that with the candidate countries
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , a great deal is being said at them moment about Europe being divided
I believe that never has Europe been so united at the level of its peoples as it is today in rejecting this war in Iraq
Opinion in all the Member States and in the candidate countries is between 80 % and 90 % opposed to war
And I wonder how Mr Poettering , whom I have known for twenty years now , can make himself so remote from the opinions of his own people
Mr President , while the dr@@ ums of war are r@@ umbling , Europe is quar@@ rel@@ ling
We are quar@@ rel@@ ling with the United States
It is incredibly tragic to see how the splendid ambitions of a common European foreign policy are slowly cr@@ umbling
The losers are the EU , NATO , the UN and relations with the United States , which are being considerably weakened
The rift may have incredibly serious consequences , and the different initiatives now coming out of the various capital cities will be of no use if they are not coordinated
Competition does not help in these circumstances
Rather , cooperation is required
As a passionate Europh@@ ile , I am ashamed of the EU 's impotence
The net is closing in on Saddam Hussein
The world 's patience is running out
It is he , and he only , that can prevent war
It is Iraq , and not the UN , that must demonstrate that there are no weapons of mass destruction in the country
Resolution 14@@ 41 is crystal clear on that point
On Friday , Dr Hans B@@ li@@ x and the inspectors will produce a new report
In his latest report , Doctor B@@ li@@ x points to the Iraqi dictator 's insufficient willingness to cooperate
Friday 's report will therefore be very important
If Doctor B@@ li@@ x and his colleagues need more time , they must be given it
It is the Security Council that must then decide what is to happen
The anti-@@ UN attitude adopted by the German Chancellor is deeply regrettable
This is not a matter of German domestic politics , but a matter concerning the whole of Europe
The UN needs our support at this difficult time
Instead of having a go at the candidate countries , Mr Sakellariou , a little self-criticism would be in order
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I wish you luck at Monday 's meeting and with your attempt to unite the Member States
Perhaps it is too late , but it is the last chance for the EU to re-establish its rather tar@@ n@@ ished reputation
There is genuine desire for peace in Iraq
If weapons inspectors can avoid the deaths of half a million civilians , then that is surely the only logical course of action we can consider
This imminent war is also about human rights and democracy in Iraq
I visited a Kurdish refugee camp in M@@ ak@@ h@@ tu@@ r in northern Iraq , where 10 000 refugees from Turkey are cap@@ tives in their own camp
They are allowed to leave the camp only under strict surveillance
How long can the international community allow the continued suffering of the Kurdish people ?
But it must be achieved through peaceful means , not through the bombing and killing of half a million defenceless men , women and children
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , this sad business of Iraq has many aspects
Consequently , Iraq is a country which has been drained of blood and which is now quite incapable of fighting any sort of war
I repeat , the propaganda must have been very powerful to make us keep on sw@@ allowing one impossible lie after another
Then again , even if Iraq were armed , what right would we have to deprive it of all means of defending itself ?
I hope that over the course of this century we shall gradually become aware of this
We have tried to explain this to Parliament , in over thirty speeches in public session , but we have tried in vain
Only legitimate defence can justify having recourse to arms
Iraq has been summoned to prove its innocence , but we know that that is a di@@ abo@@ lical demand , because in law it is for the accus@@ er to prove guilt
Con@@ temp@@ tible , dis@@ creditable processes have been used to justify this aggression
Mr Blair dared to present as evidence to the House of Commons a document stolen from a student and dating from ten years ago
Colin Powell , too , authen@@ tic@@ ated it before the Security Council
Even when their deception was discovered , neither of them drew the obvious conclusion , namely resignation
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that Mr Le Pen is applying the yardstick in not quite the right way
If anyone is a mass murderer , it is Saddam Husse@@ in@@ ; of that there is no doubt
The question is by what means he may be dis@@ armed
We have to make clear the necessity of using every possibility of a peaceful solution , no matter how difficult that may be in the days that remain to us
I think it is important to see that there must be no emotional reflex actions
But the use of force can be avoided only if Europeans present a united front
All those who have violated this unity have also thrown away Europe 's chance of playing a part in this dispute
Mr President , on the issue of Iraq , Europe is not divided
Its governments are , but its public opinion is not
As we all know , the majority of European public opinion is united against war
So the discussion on the division of Europe , in relation to the CFSP , must take this aspect into account
And , incidentally , the European citizens should take this into account when casting their votes in the forthcoming elections
Having said that , I also have faith in the public opinion of those candidate countries
I am less optimistic when it comes to the gulf separating us from the United States , or rather the gulf which the Bush Administration is widening every day
This fran@@ c@@ ophobia is being cultivated alongside ger@@ man@@ ophobia
Well , in view of this I would declare myself to be German and a Social Democrat
In my opinion , though , the greatest and most significant bl@@ under is from Richard Bou@@ cher , spokesman for the State Department
So it now turns out , Mr President , dear friends , that the Bush Administration sponsors war between civilisations
Mr President , the risk of terrorism is omni@@ present now
The d@@ ull and bro@@ o@@ ding presence of sudden , un@@ anticipated and violent death hangs over military and civilians alike in all our nations
Lin@@ ks have been found recently between the Al Qaeda network and pro-@@ Saddam forces fighting the free Kurdish people in northern Iraq
the M@@ K@@ O , or ME@@ K as they are known inside the USA
The USA fro@@ ze ME@@ K assets in 1994 , declaring the group under its many ali@@ ases to be an international terrorist organisation
Our recent debates on Iraq have been attended by known members of M@@ K@@ O
These people are a threat to world security
This is Saddam 's private international terrorist army , working against us all
For war or no war , with or without a war , the criminals who make up the M@@ K@@ O continually kill and destroy the innocent among us
I know that it will be extremely difficult to reach agreement at next Monday 's summit of European leaders , but I refuse to accept that this is inevitable
There are the French proposals to increase the number and power of the inspectors
Next Friday , there will probably be a cautiously positive report from Dr Hans B@@ li@@ x and Mo@@ hamed El Bar@@ ade@@ i in favour of doing just that
I urge those same governments not to turn their backs on Europe
Mr President , UN Resolution 14@@ 41 must be complied with
Some say that this is exclusively Saddam Hussein 's responsibility
They are placing the fate of the world in the hands of a psy@@ ch@@ opath@@ ic dictator
We too have a responsibility , namely to work out how much cooperation is required here and now in order to prevent a war
We must give the weapons inspectors more time
We must support the Franco-German proposal , and we must do so partly on humanitarian grounds
UNHCR has drawn attention to the fact that 100 000 Iraqis would die in the first 48 hours of a war
Seven million people would be without food , and 22 million debilit@@ ated Iraqis would be without clean drinking water
There would be a danger of civil war
Dare we take responsibility for all this by demanding that UN resolutions be complied with to the letter here and now ?
I also think that this debate is too serious to be subordinated to domestic policy
Mr President , last Monday 's joint declaration by France , Germany and Russia begins with a sentence which I believe everyone will approve of
If we are to avoid becoming bogged down , however , there is only one new argument , and that is the threat of armed intervention
It is absolutely essential that this argument should remain credible
We must do nothing to destroy its credibility if we want the discussions to make the progress that we are hoping for
This is why I believe deeply , Mr President , that the apparently different strategies of the countries of Europe and the United States are complementary rather than contradictory
We would do better to harness this complementary aspect if we are to avoid playing Saddam Hussein 's game
Mr President , we are glad that the European Council has been called , as my Group has demanded
I imagine that the Greek Presidency will be holding very intense contacts in order to propose a common position , because intentions are not sufficient
Meanwhile , the Member States have taken positions
The Bush Doc@@ tr@@ ine is founded on the assumption of the unilateral use of military might , underpinned by a commitment to preventive warfare
We in Europe must affirm our commitment to a multilateral approach , in other words , to the United Nations
We in Europe must start by using every means other than military force
We in Europe reject the theory of preventive strikes against potential dangers
We affirm our commitment to containing them , above all when this approach has a chance of success
What does that mean in terms of Iraq ?
I believe it to mean that we all , out of profound conviction , ab@@ h@@ or this regime in Iraq and its in@@ humanity
Everyone living in Iraq has the right to democratic government
Anyone who campaigns - as I do - for the rights of the Kurds in Turkey cannot fail to campaign for the rights of Kurds in Iraq
Everyone living in the region and beyond it has a justified interest in weapons of mass destruction not ending up in the hands of Saddam Hussein
Is it not possible , though , to use inspections , surveillance flights , and other non-violent means to prevent him from getting his hands on dangerous weapons ?
Europe must surely not allow itself to be characterised by the pursuit of a policy of non-@@ resistance and appeasement in the face of the present dangers
We Europeans contend particularly for democracy and the rule of law in the Arab world , but we do not do it with weapons in our hands
Even ' old Europe ' seeks a secure source of oil and gas , but do we therefore have the right to wage war for the sake of oil ?
Are we not aware that there is a UN resolution , relating to this region , that dates back to 19@@ 47 and has still not yet been complied with ?
Even so , we are not willing to go to war , and rightly
So I do believe that , yes , we are to help the United Nations get what it is entitled to
Then our position would be a truly European one
Mr President , after both the First and Second World Wars , people demanded ' No More War
They expressly rejected any preventive war of aggression without United Nations approval
Looking at things from this angle , the European Union must do everything possible to avert a unilateral war of aggression
Europe 's peoples have long known this , and now it is time for European politics to grasp it
The Council , the Commission and Parliament , acting together , can help to bring about a change in the situation in Baghdad
However , war can be avoided if Saddam Hussein leaves his country or if he can provide concrete evidence that he has destroyed all the prohibited weapons
Thus far , the dictator has failed to comply with the United Nations ' requests formulated in the 1991 resolution
If Iraq had behaved like South Africa , Belarus or Kazakhstan , we would not be in this tragic situation now
The Baghdad regime is guilty of a major violation of the will of the UN
Iraq has , in practice , failed to comply
I wonder , and I put it to you , whether it is still possible to prevent conflict
It may be , but Europe must stand united , the international community must stand united
Indeed , the Iraqi regime will use each division , each sign of weakening , to attempt to strengthen its own positions
That is why I support the position calling upon the institutions and governments of Europe to follow three guidelines
Firstly , to strengthen relations between the countries of the Union in order to achieve a common position
Thirdly , to make every endeavour to preserve the credibility of the multilateral organisations , NATO and the UN
In conclusion , Mr President , not forcing Saddam Hussein to respect the United Nations resolution is tantamount to di@@ vesting the Security Council of its authority
This is the line being taken by the Italian Government , which will be at the helm of the Union during the second half of the year
I feel this is another reason why we must pay careful attention to and support the peace-keeping initiatives emanating from Rome
Mr President , I have to say that I was more than a little surprised to hear Commissioner Nielson 's opening remarks
He said that the poverty in Iraq at the moment is a result of the Iran@@ -@@ Iraq war , the Gulf war and ten years of international sanctions
I heard no mention whatsoever that Saddam Hussein has used weapons of mass destruction to kill hundreds of thousands of his own people
We must be clear that the villa@@ in of this piece is Saddam Hussein - full stop
Any weakening of that position will make war more , not less , likely
Commissioner Nielson also said that this is not an institutional problem , but then he gave us an institutional solution
He said that we could solve all these problems by more QMV
QMV will not create the political will to have common policies
We should have a common foreign and security policy - not a single policy but a common policy
We all have our views on how it is that the common policy set in Copenhagen has suddenly somewhat dis@@ integrated
Nonetheless , we must have a common policy
We have to be united in accepting that those serious consequences will follow
Any weakening of that position runs the risk of undermining world global security
If we are to resolve this situation we need less na@@ me-@@ calling and a more coherent approach
Mr President , 12 years ago this month , we saw the cease-fire after the liberation of Kuwait
In March 1991 , UN Resolution 6@@ 86 set out the conditions of the cease-fire
In April 1991 UN Resolution 6@@ 87 required Iraq to accept the internationally supervised destruction , removal or rendering harmless of all chemical and biological weapons , agents and components
In August 1991 , UN Resolution 7@@ 07 condemned Iraq 's non-compliance
And yet , unlike when we took action to rescue the Fal@@ k@@ lands , Kuwait and Bosnia , this time our constituents are uneasy and uncertain
They see no unity of purpose among the governments of Europe
They see Member States declining to comply with their N@@ ato obligation to protect Turkey against the possibility of attack
Their fears are confirmed that a European defence policy could be dangerous for N@@ ato
They do not know why action is being proposed , what is supposed to happen at the end of it and which countries might be next
The guilt of Saddam Hussein is in effect being compounded by the failure of our leaders to explain
My own Prime Minister , Mr Blair , has ab@@ y@@ sm@@ ally failed to persuade the British people
He could not even persuade a single one of his own Labour MEPs to vote for his policy
Unlike Iraq , we are democracies
Unlike Saddam , Mr Blair , you cannot go to war without he@@ eding the concerns of your own people
It is time we set out the facts and destroyed the myths
UN inspectors are not like a team of archae@@ o@@ logists exc@@ av@@ ating for ancient M@@ eso@@ pota@@ mia in the sand
It is not their task to play ' seek ' to Saddam 's ' hide '
They are there to assess Saddam 's evidence of how , when and where he has destroyed or handed over his weapons of mass destruction
We do not need more inspectors
Mr B@@ li@@ x has confirmed that
We need compliance by Saddam Hussein
Where are those precursor chemicals , the munitions ?
I do not believe that any of us want war
We want peace , but we want a peace that is free from the threat of terrorism
It seems to me that most of the comments in the media are designed to appeal to the emotions rather than to provide an objective analysis of the situation
Ladies and gentlemen , this is a question of peace or of war , of the life or the death of many human beings
That is what is at stake here , and it leaves little room for taking up positions which are demagogic , precipit@@ ate or tactical
Let us all , together , show our s@@ ang@@ -@@ fro@@ id and our capacity for reflection , and we shall overcome our differences
Mr President , with war looming , the European Union is displaying discord that is viewed with dis@@ belief and bewil@@ der@@ ment by our citizens
is war inevitable ?
This is a man who , out of self-interest , has attacked a peaceful neighbouring country
This is a man who has used poison gas on rebel Kurdish villages , thereby killing thousands of men , women and children
This is a man who permanently terror@@ ises the south of his country , with its Shi@@ -@@ ite population
This is a man who has amassed enormous wealth at the expense of his people and is also still proud of having personally carried out executions
To my mind , it is naive to go looking for weapons in that large country with 200 inspectors
Do you know that , in recent years , 6 000 inspectors have gone looking for weapons ?
Is it not very easy , given that the country has so many inaccessible mountainous regions , to hide weapons of this kind in ca@@ ves ?
I am in favour of a second Security Council resolution provided that the solution to the problem is not delayed further
But the position of France , Germany and Belgium in this as dissidents in the European camp is terribly worrying
Why have you not made the greatest efforts to agree on a single line ?
S@@ it yourselves down together , as the Ministers for Agriculture did earlier , until the white smoke comes out
Mr President , we all know that the European population is clear about what it wants
It wants a peaceful solution to the conflict in Iraq
I assume that our Heads of Government also have that in view , all of them
The question to which the European population would like to hear an answer from its leaders goes without saying
we must also have the courage to do some soul-searching ourselves
They are all serious questions
We should encourage them not only to deliberate but also to reach clear , unanimous conclusions
firstly , Europe does not have strategic defence capacity against the new forms of international terrorism that are bound up with the States that support them;
secondly , the only strategic defence body of which Europeans countries are members is NATO
The crisis in NATO will make any common defence policy for the European Union im@@ possible;
thirdly , for the enlargement countries , with their recent experience of totalitarian regimes , security concerns are vital
Lastly , the effect of a crisis in NATO will isolate the Europeans , and will reinforce the United States ' tendency to act unilaterally
Mr President , I have nothing much to add to what I said at the start of the debate
I should like to thank the groups and speakers who supported the Greek Presidency 's initiative to convene the Council next Monday
I have taken very careful note of the positions , thoughts , concerns and various points raised
This is a major issue and every proposal has merit
Also , irrespective of the outcome or the decisions taken , we also need to look at what problems will arise in the humanitarian and economic sectors
There may be serious ramifications and we need to be prepared for that
The debate is closed
The majority of the members of the Security Council seem to want to give peace another chance
They prefer to disarm Iraq by peaceful means , using the weapons inspectors
More pressure must be put on Iraq to cooperate
Parliament has contributed to this through its resolution and by a number of MEPs travelling to Baghdad to explain our position
A majority in Parliament is on the same wavelength , therefore , as the majority of the public
It is remarkable that the governments of some Member States would rather take the side of the United States than that of their own citizens
Even Turkey , traditionally a staunch supporter of the United States , considers war to be very risky
And then people say that France , Germany and Belgium are isolated
Would it not be the US , rather , that was isolated if they could not bring to bear a whole arsenal of means of coercion ?
It is not enough to make every effort to stave off a military invasion of Iraq
It now seems to be an established fact that the Government of the United States is determined to go to war against Iraq , whatever the Security Council decides
With or without the authorisation of the Security Council , this war is unjustifiable
Of course we must hope that reason will prevail within the Security Council and that , if there is a war , it will be formally contrary to international legality
The Iraqi army is merely a shadow of its former self , and is formidable only in the hall@@ uc@@ inations of the American President
This war will be another cr@@ ushing blow for people who are already suffering greatly , particularly the Kurdish population
Among those people it will give rise to lasting and justified hatred of the West , and will cause innumerable tragedies
This crisis shows how far Europe still has to go before it becomes anything other than an integrated economic area
I welcome very much this opportunity to take stock of progress and achievement in the area of Freedom , Security and Justice in 2002 , as we do every year
Stric@@ tly , according to the Treaty we are supposed to do so only on Third Pillar matters of criminal law , police and judicial cooperation
That does not make any sense , so we allow ourselves to range a little wider , and bring in asylum and immigration as well
It is not very satisfactory , and our two committees ought to work together on this annual report
Our first concern is whether there is sufficient coherence in the work being done@@ ; whether the strategies , plans and sco@@ re@@ boards are being followed
We feel that the use by Member States of their right of initiative has been unhelpful to consistent progress through the work programme
We are only now on the brink of getting proposals for strengthening rights to a fair trial and legal enforcement of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
We are still lacking measures to protect data privacy against s@@ no@@ oping on e-mails , telephone calls and Internet usage
We still have no agreement on matters like the definition of a refugee or the procedures for deciding asylum claims
Our second concern is the related issue of lack of balance
Our last concern is the absence of sufficient democratic accountability
We welcome the report of Working Group X of the Convention
We support their conclusions , seeking to remove the impediments to the achievement of democratic accountability and coherent decision-making
We would also like a political dialogue with national parliaments
Some progress was made , there was some activity in 2002 , but the conclusion has to be ' could do better '
I should like at this point to thank Baroness Ludford , whose oral question has provided the basis for today 's debate
Within that framework , the Council adopted a set of acts on police and judicial cooperation on criminal and civil matters
In all , over 100 acts were adopted , including regulations , framework decisions , decisions and joint positions , resolutions , recommendations and other acts
Parliament itself made a telling contribution to this work through the consultation procedure and with its excellent resolutions
That brings me to the questions , not that this list is by any means complete
The Presidency attends Parliament in order to present its programme of work at the beginning of each term of office and the results of the Justice and Home Affairs Councils
I would also remind you that the Council replies to all written and oral questions put to it by the honourable Members
At the same time , informal contacts are constantly being strengthened , especially at the meetings of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms or at informal ministerial meetings
In reply to the second question , the Council does not believe that adopting Community acts on sensitive justice and home affairs issues is taking an inordin@@ ate amount of time
That is why opinions are indeed sometimes requested by fairly tight deadlines , so that acts can be adopted at Council level as quickly as possible
In reply to the third question , the Council would point out that its work is carried out within the framework of the rules laid down in the Treaties
Because the issue is so complex , a certain procedural speed is required , but that derives from the Treaty itself and is not of the Council 's making
As you know , the Council has no authority to amend the Treaty
Until then , I can assure you that all of us in the Council are endeavouring to promote cohesive , rational policy , and are demonstrating the necessary political will
The initiatives taken by the Member States within this framework , either alone or jointly , prove exactly how useful that right is
Similarly , the Council 's framework decision on the status of victims during criminal proceedings was initiated by one Member State
The regulation on insolvency proceedings initiated by two Member States finally brought about a result after a full thirty years of discussion within the Community framework
The regulation on obtaining evidence is another such success story
In reply to the fifth question , under the Treaty of Amsterdam , the Council will be required five years after the Treaty enters into force , i
The Council has not yet been asked to decide on the specific issue raised in the question
Consequently , this is a question the Council will have an opportunity to decide on in the future , taking account of the opinion of the European Parliament
The European Council in Seville , on 21 and 22 June 2002 , took an important step towards implementing the Tampere programme
However , this last question gives me the opportunity to conclude with a number of the Greek Presidency 's thoughts on the question of human rights in the judicial sector
At the same time , we need balanced , global policies
These two principles are inextricably linked
I believe that , if the importance of fundamental freedoms is overlooked , there will be a visible risk of our policy becoming fragmented , unilateral and irrational
It would be a mistake to assume that these two virtues are mutually exclusive
I have pointed out on numerous occasions , and I do so again now , that more security does not mean and must not mean less freedom
With these thoughts in mind , the Greek Presidency has introduced a new framework decision on the mutual recognition by Member States of final judgments in criminal cases
We cannot take a unilateral approach to judicial assistance
We also have to make sure that defendants cannot be prosecuted for the same offence in more than one Member State
The same principle governs the question of minimum guarantees for suspects and defendants
This debate must also be seen in the context of the forthcoming enlargement and of the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe
Giving the right of legislative initiative to a Member State or to some Member States will always cause problems and confusion in implementing common codecision rules
the European arrest warrant and the framework decision on combating terrorism
New priority has been given to measures intended to combat illegal immigration and to establish the common management of our external borders
This progress must of course be assessed in light of the timetable and programmes for measures established at Tampere
The Commission emphasised once again in the last scoreboard , of 16 December 2002 , that there are still delays in adopting asylum and immigration issues
We will consequently have the basic legislative framework in the field of immigration policy that is being discussed in Council
I would also add the initiative that the Commission will be adopting next month to present a communication focusing on the issue of integrating third-country nationals into European reception societies
I also welcome the fact that this conclusion has been reached by the Convention 's working group with a broad majority
Nevertheless , we must emphasise that not all networks present the same added value and that the Council should be more particular in selecting its priorities for establishing these networks
Our view is that priority should now be given to the framework decision on combating terrorism , which should be transposed by all Member States by the end of 2002
We are gathering information from the Member States on this transposal and we hope to be able to present the corresponding report by the end of 2003
To this end , following a recommendation of the European Parliament , the Commission has created a network of experts in fundamental rights
For our part , before this Council we will be adopting a Green Paper on common rules for procedural guarantees for persons standing trial anywhere in the Union
The Commission is consequently committed to establishing minimum common rules in this field , as stated in its presentation of the annual work programme for 2003
In short , the progress that has been made is unequivocal and undeniable
I cannot do other than endorse the rapporteur 's constitutional thinking on the subject of asylum and immigration policy
She is also right in her conclusion that the EU is a long way from implementing what was decided at Tampere
It so happens , Baroness Ludford , that minimum standards are often the lowest common denominator
Let us turn to counter-terrorism , an area in which 2002 has seen great progress made
The common definition of terrorism , the European arrest warrant , and the reinforcement of Europol were important milestones on the road towards terrorism being effectively combated in Europe
Your disputes about competence will not , at any rate , meet with much public sympathy
Baroness Ludford has diagnosed an imbalance between the methods of counter-terrorism on the one hand and guaranteed fundamental rights on the other
I do not see that such is the case
As well as that , though , the Schengen Agreement and its associated information system have to be brought within the Community sphere
I might add that the EU has wasted years of valuable time when it comes to these matters , which are closely connected with its own enlargement
For far too long , Commissioner Verheugen has been l@@ ul@@ ling the EU to sleep and reassuring it that no reforms are needed
The second generation SIS has now been delayed , and frameworks for common border control are also only in their early stages - all this with enlargement one year away
These are issues where we have to work , even now , much more closely with the candidate countries than we have done before
And I would also like to thank the Council and the European Commission for their comprehensive replies
I believe that the citizens expect us to deal with this issue from a Community point of view
With regard to asylum and immigration , the truth is that I have been perplexed all day
Now it seems that , on the contrary , we are only calling for certain minimal things in the field of immigration
Mr President , 1999 already seems ages ago
What I say is not entirely true , of course , because actually a lot has happened , only not in the du@@ sty chambers of the Council
Since 1999 , roughly 700 000 legal migrants a year have come to the European Union to work
And in those same four years around two million il@@ leg@@ als have entered Europe
That is one of the reasons for adopting a European approach
At the moment there are 40 for every 100
It is not hard to imagine the effects this will have on the welfare state and pensions
It strikes me that the Council has been ignoring the long view
Recent years tell the story of how it has continued to look anxiously at how things are going and taken decisions on an ad hoc basis
We need to get real@@ ; now is the time to act
Immigration , of whatever kind , and the ageing of the population pay no attention to the passing of time@@ ; they just carry on unabated
There is no solution to be found in either a Fortress Europe or a rejuven@@ ating eli@@ x@@ ir
My proposal to the Council is that we take a decision on European immigration policy during the Greek Presidency and stop pussy@@ footing around
Today Parliament voted on a directive on the entry and residence of citizens of third countries who want to enter the European Union to work
If you , the Council , really want to mean something to the citizens of Europe , vote for this directive
In other words , what we have here is simply a bill which lumps together immigration , poverty and insecurity
The most vulnerable people and ethnic minorities are the ones most severely affected by this repressive policy
I am thinking of the Rom@@ any people , whom the European Union is threatening with expulsion and rejecting in practice
What Europe needs , therefore , is a new immigration policy
Mr President , I too would like to thank Baroness Ludford
I think that her pertinent oral questions have enabled us to have a debate which is obviously very interesting
I agree essentially with her analysis of the situation
I believe that we cannot really accuse the Council of any lack of activity this year
When it comes to the general interests of Europe , the sum of national ego@@ isms does not constitute the law
I should like to draw your attention to work which is currently in progress
The analyses that have been made , on a country by country basis , show that there have been considerable developments which are quite alarming
I believe that these obvious deni@@ als of people 's right , for example to seek asylum in Europe , are extremely worrying
For example , we discovered at the seminar that readmission agreements were actually an incitement to Member States to create such camps
We cannot forget , however , that these matters are of enormous political sensitivity
We are inv@@ ading the traditional sovereign borders of the Member States , a fact that cannot be ignored or played down
Recent international events are a clear reminder that the European Union is still made up of sovereign States
In fact , the way in which we approach terrorism these days is completely different to the approach pursued in the 1970s and 1980s
We know that the terrorist threat today is hard to see and is underpinned by motives other than political ones
We also know that it is extremely mobile and that it uses , as we all do , modern means of communication
We know that its sources of funding are diverse and that this funding is often obtained under the guise of promoting respectable aims
No less importantly , we know that it certainly has access to arms of mass destruction , especially chemical and biological weapons
The presence of these new terrorist threats undeniably requires action at European level
Unilateral national action is no longer sufficient to ensure that our populations are protected
These new concerns do not mean , however , that we should indefinitely extend the rules of Community initiative and of qualified majority in this entire area
We believe that these developments do not necessarily mean that the Union 's procedures must all be produced or implemented in the same way
Mr President , the annual debate on the area of freedom , security and justice seems to be in large measure directed at the future and not the year 2002
This would make decision-making in the Council more democratic and more structured , because there has been a jum@@ ble of initiatives from the Member States recently
The criticism is justified
Part of the solution lies in a better treaty structure and the implementation of different decision-making procedures in certain areas
But I am still convinced that fus@@ sing about the powers at European level will not by definition improve the situation very much
Nor does a European constitution offer any added value
Following on from this , it remains for the Council to concern itself less with prestige and to spend more time on working to achieve results
You should be allocating up to 80 % of the funds required , but this requires that you take the necessary precautions right now
The Member States are to be urged to take the necessary precautions by appointing authorities to which the Commission may have recourse
I would very much like to know how , and to what extent , you envisage acting upon these proposals
That is something I can only endorse
So what is the situation today ?
Commissioner Vitorino is thinking up something good
By making proposals , he is discharging the obligations laid on him by the scoreboard that he announced after Tampere
What he proposes goes too far for the Council , on the assumption that they actually read the stuff
The proposals then end up in Parliament , and Parliament adds to them and forwards them to the Council
What does the Council do ?
It throws them in the waste-@@ paper basket
Such is the reality of the situation today
Now , I do not want to tread on the Council 's toes
I am quite convinced that the Greek Presidency of the Council will read everything
What we need in future , though , is a different way of making laws , one in which the balance between the three institutions involved is safeguarded
This will involve all three bodies being willing to compromise
And thirdly , it is one of our institution 's failings
It is at this point that Members of the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats should pr@@ ick up their ears and listen
Let us talk together , so that we are not always coming up with the minimum of consensus , but can get the legislative work done
What are your demands , and what are ours ?
Where are you prepared to give some ground on your position , and where are we prepared to give some ground on our own ?
Where , then , can we achieve real compromises that make real law-making possible ?
If we want to do real legislative work , then I invite you to discuss compromise , but you will then have to demonstrate your capacity for it
This will involve you putting some of the hard@@ liners in your ranks on the lead
But , Mr von Boetticher and Mr Pirker , being made of the stuff you are , I am sure you will manage that
On top of that , there is increased monitoring of personal data and of free communication
Bi@@ ome@@ tric means are being used to evacu@@ ate privacy of any meaning
Such , though , is not the case
What we are building here is a Union of state security , control and monitoring
Baroness Ludford 's Liber@@ alism , does not , unfortunately , extend to addressing any of these points in her question
That was 20 years ago tomorrow
In 2002 , 6@@ 34 politically motivated people were arrested
127 of them subsequently claimed in court that they had suffered ill treatment or torture
Have the Council and the Commission received clear information about this issue from the Spanish Government ?
Do the Council and the Commission consider that the transparency principle has been respected by the Spanish Government ?
Last year the Spanish Government proposed the banning of several social organisations - media and cultural associations - that had denounced the political repression suffered by Basque dissidents
Through a Spanish initiative , the European Union has drawn up a black list of associations and individuals accused of specific or tacit support for terrorism
The accused have neither the legal means of defence nor effective access to the courts
Do the Council and the Commission consider there to have been real enforcement of the democratic control principle with regard to Spain ?
Will the Council and the Commission put forward a judicial instrument in the new texts being prepared for those included on the European Union 's black list ?
I would like to thank Baroness Ludford and express my recognition of the effort she has made in this important area
They are the enemies of freedom , security and justice in Europe
Furthermore , we must not forget this Parliament 's constant appeals in favour of protection and support for the victims of terrorism
In the field of immigration and asylum , the progress made is not entirely satisfactory
Parliament will do everything it can to ensure that the time limits established at the Seville European Council are respected
How can we resolve amongst 25 something which we have not able to decide amongst 15 ?
Parliament reflected this situation , in which decisions were adapted within the first or the third pillar , in a resolution in 1999
Today we are glad to discover that these same arguments have found consensus within the Convention charged with reforming the Treaties
Important Commission initiatives , both before and after 11 September 2001 , remain deadlocked in Council or are still waiting to be transposed or ratified by the Member States
As a rule , these proposals make a min@@ uscule , if not counterproductive , contribution to the objectives that these States themselves have imposed on successive European summits
We are seeing a pro@@ c@@ ession of out@@ lan@@ dish proposals , by which I mean proposals that are not part of any plan or form part of the Commission scoreboard
2002 was more positive than previous years and we saw a considerable number of initiatives in the field of justice and home affairs
On the other , much still remains to be done in order to achieve a practical and effective system for safeguarding citizens ' rights
In other words , there can be no security without freedom and justice
Furthermore , the imposition of matters pertaining to the first pillar and of means that fall under the third pillar has been an ongoing source of difficulties
Decisions need to be taken , especially in areas such as data protection
With regard to Europol and Eurojust , it is regrettable that there is still only an indirect democratic division of responsibility , which is fragmented and insufficiently limited
To conclude , Mr President , the reduced level of democratic legitimacy that we are still seeing is also a matter of regret
Parliament is rarely consulted and often on political agreements that have already been concluded in Council , which means that our contribution is an irrelevant and useless document
I imagine that this is what concerns the citizens of Europe
The points made basically reflect what the citizens of Europe expect of us in the old and the new Europe
In the Europe we are all now building together
The points made by the honourable Members reinforced my own view that greater security must not mean cutting back and compromising on freedoms
Besides , individual freedoms and human rights are elements of our European legal culture
I was also particularly interested in the honourable Members ' comments that measures must be taken to guard borders at European level
We all want to find a way of protecting , guarding and controlling Europe 's borders , by which I mean the external borders of the European Union
What I mean is we have a certain amount of experience here
One of the topics being discussed , and which will continue to be discussed , is how to apportion the burden
We need to find a way of apportioning the burden fairly at European level so that we can strengthen our border controls
It even exacerbates the position of immigrants already in the European Union
I shall close with a brief reply to a question about whether there is a risk of a mass influx of refugees in the wake of possible events in Iraq
There is , I think , a daily risk of a mass influx of refugees from countries outside the European Union and this is being discussed in the relevant committees
I think that we need Community financial support and we need to spread the burden fairly , irrespective of what happens in Iraq
Of course we all hope that developments will not result in situations which give rise to another mass influx of refugees arriving in the European Union
Mr President , I wish to begin by thanking all those who have contributed to this debate and , above all , Baroness Ludford for her excellent contribution
I shall just address a few of the questions raised during the debate , starting with a remark by Mr Schulz
We should all resist the temptation to reduce the debate on asylum and migration to a purely ideological debate
It is indeed tempting and very easy to do this by using slogans to manipulate emotions
It might even be tempting to make the Commission the bad gu@@ y
I am used to performing several roles , but this would be a new one for me
This is not for ideological reasons
If I appear too generous , I would like to recall that the Commission put forward a proposal for a framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings
The Commission presented the action plan on illegal migration that was taken on board by the Council
The Commission presented the action plan on external border controls that was taken on board by the Council
The Commission presented the proposal on the return action plan
The Commission made the proposal on a new Schengen information system
The Commission proposed the creation of a visa database
If this is being too generous , I admit that I have some differences with some Members regarding the notion of generosity
When it comes to the new terrorist threat , as Mr Queiró has emphasised , we recognise that we are confronted with a phenomenon we know little about
Therefore I hope that during 2003 , Member States will be able to make effective progress in achieving concrete results and adopt legislation to combat the financing of terrorism
I now turn to the issue raised by Mr Co@@ e@@ h@@ lo
Finally , on the very important issue raised by Mr Pirker , I can guarantee that we are preparing for the possibility of a mass influx
I do not want to anticipate the evolution of international events , but we have learned much from the experience in Kosovo
We have the directive on temporary protection
Therefore , to deal with the most urgent situations we can mobilise , in the very short term , the reserve of the fund for European refugees
My colleague , Commissioner Nielson , together with ECHO , and in close coordination with UNHCR , is looking at the possibility of supporting refugees in the region
I hope that this time things will work much better , thanks to the progress that has been achieved as far as temporary protection is concerned
I would like to pay my sincere respects to Parliament
If we have problems in terms of progress during this year Parliament cannot be blamed for any kind of delay
It has always given its opinions on time
The debate is closed
The vote will be held on 11 March
They suffer from memory loss , chronic pain and fati@@ gue , symptoms of paralysis and have an increased risk of cancer
United Nations statistics , published in the renowned ' British Medical Journal ' , indicate that the incidence of cancer in southern Iraq increased seven@@ fold between 1989 and 1994
Even the US Army Environmental Policy Institute has acknowledged the potentially very serious medical consequences of the use of depleted uranium
Weapons and ammunition that harm the civilian population are in contravention of the Geneva Convention and the Convention on Con@@ ven@@ tional Weapons
The second Convention is very explicit
It imposes a prohibition or restriction on the use of certain conventional weapons that are deemed to cause excessive injury or that do not discriminate between military and civilian targets
According to information leaked from the Pentag@@ on , about 3 000 guided bombs were fired in the first wave of attacks in Iraq
It seems very likely that the US will use ammunition with depleted uranium again
Parliament must continue to warn of the potential dangers of the use of this type of ammunition
There is an urgent need for an independent , scientific study of the effects of its use , not only on health but also on the environment
We must have a moratorium on the use of depleted uranium while we wait for the results of such a study
You will understand that I would really like to hear from the current President-in-Office of the Council why Greece is actually waiting before signing this important Convention
Mr President , I just wish to make a point of order
There was no simultaneous interpretation into Portuguese during the last speech
I would therefore ask you to have someone look into this matter
These particles emit al@@ pha@@ -@@ radioactivity , which is particularly aggressive towards living tissue
De@@ ple@@ ted uranium particles , once lodged inside an organism , may cause severe damage to the health not only of military personnel but of civilians as well
Scientific uncertainty about their measurable effects on health is thus being used as an argument for doing nothing
The precautionary principle , however , would seem to argue in favour of an additional protocol to the 1980 Convention , explicitly prohibiting these depleted uranium weapons
This is what my group is seeking
Last week we were in Iraq , and at the hospital in Bas@@ ra we were shocked and saddened to see children suffering from cancer and con@@ genital mal@@ formations
The figures published by the University of Bas@@ ra for the region are shocking
Between 1990 and 2001 , the rate of con@@ genital mal@@ formations has been constantly rising , and has now increased seven@@ fold
Scientists are quite logically blaming this on the fact that parents are contaminated with depleted uranium
We do not have the right to allow such situations , which are the consequences of real war crimes , to prolifer@@ ate
Yet in Afghanistan , contrary to the official deni@@ als , even more powerful weapons were used , weapons equipped with a covering of depleted uranium or even natural uranium
These were guided bombs or cruise missiles
These are weapons that are contrary to the provisions of the Geneva Convention on how we are to treat one another in the course of war
I therefore think the Council and the Commission should understand that , firstly , we must prevent these types of war crime from being committed
We must prevent these weapons being used in possible future conflicts and , clearly , we are all nowadays thinking of Iraq in this connection
There are , however , other places too in which this could be relevant
That was the first aspect
The second is to follow up those crimes that have already been committed
We must also be prepared to apply them , and we must be prepared to apply the sanctions available to us at present
It is the EU that must take this task upon itself
I eagerly await the Council 's and the Commission 's answers
Mr President , as we are all aware , dormant explosive devices , landmines and cluster bombs are among the weapons that can cause especially cruel injuries and mutil@@ ations
Those of us who have been to countries in conflict will know the mutil@@ ations and wounds with which one is confronted there
I myself became familiar with these sights in Central America
Parliament has , in various resolutions , insisted on the implementation of the 1997 Ottawa Convention , which banned the use of landmines
I look forward to hearing what the President-in-Office of the Council will have to say in response to this question
I think he might well be about to bring Parliament good news from Greece
The worldwide campaign against landmines has already made great progress
Considerable efforts are currently being made to get belli@@ ge@@ rent parties other than states to sign up to the Ottawa Convention
In Somalia , for example , 15 organisations and belli@@ ge@@ rent parties , none of them part of any state apparatus , have signed the Convention
Previous speakers have described this , and I wish to touch on it only very briefly
You are all familiar with the descriptions of the horrendous injuries resulting from the deployment of cluster bombs
The particularly dreadful thing about it is that the spl@@ inters from the cluster bombs that remain in the human body are almost never capable of being removed
This makes the precision bombing of military targets impossible , so that there is an increased risk of innocent people being injured
Finally , these bombs also vary in their effect over time , since , if they do not explode , they can remain live for years to come
It was in December 2001 that Parliament last recalled the 1980 UN agreement on certain conventional weapons and demanded an immediate moratorium on the use of cluster bombs
It is here that the European Union could , by its actions , give a very good example
Mr President , I have nothing much to say about landmines
We have all seen the television foot@@ age of maimed children , including recently in various areas of former Yugoslavia
Most of what I have to say has to do with depleted uranium
Natural uranium contains over 99 % uranium 2@@ 38 and very little uranium 2@@ 35
U@@ ran@@ ium 2@@ 35 is excellent as a fuel in nuclear reactors and is used in nuclear weapons
Consequently , the material is enriched with uranium 2@@ 35 and what is left , the residue , which is mainly uranium 2@@ 38 , is what we know as depleted uranium
This depleted uranium is used in bombs because it is very dense and highly penetr@@ at@@ ing; it can b@@ last through flo@@ ors , tank arm@@ ouring and so on
However , the drawback is that it va@@ por@@ ises when it explo@@ des
These oxides end up as soluble uranium sal@@ ts over an area of 10-@@ 15 kilometres , although they are often carried several hundred kilometres on the wind
They can be inhaled , enter the water supply and so on
Also , depleted uranium takes several thousand years to decay
If an area is contaminated , it remains contaminated for thousands of years
I think that the European Parliament should vote for it and that the Commission should take up and monitor this issue
It will therefore be easier to assess all the consequences underlying this debate
Mr President , war is always war and its effects are always appalling
The fact is , however , that sometimes we cannot escape the need for military intervention or its inev@@ itability
There is growing concern amongst interested communities and also amongst the general public in this field
Incidentally , and to conclude , Mr President , I wish to say a few words about the people that this debate is seeking to protect
This would not be the first such action
Portugal , for example , has been doing just this
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is particularly concerned about the deaths and injury caused every year by explosive rem@@ n@@ ants of war
Allow me to quote a few examples of Union activities in this sector
The Union also submitted a paper on explosive rem@@ n@@ ants of war to the team of government experts set up by the second review congress
The congress agreed with the recommendation of the team of government experts that negotiations should start on an instrument for these explo@@ sives
The Council 's competent working party will be discussing future Union action in this sector
The Council has not received reports of any NATO members using cluster bombs
The common action authorised the Presidency to take suitable measures
These demar@@ ches are carried out by the Presidency at the time
The Union has also been promoting the universality of the Convention at all the appropriate fora , especially the United Nations
The resolutions of the General Assembly on the application of the Convention have been unanimously supported by the Member States of the European Union
Exceptions may only be made for humanitarian reasons
This stand by the Union has created an important incentive for countries to sign up to the convention banning landmines
Nor has the Council discussed ongoing work on this question at the United Nations
Finally , the Council does not have a catalogue of depleted uranium ammunition in current use
Decisions on the use of various types of ammunition are taken by Member States exercising their national sovereignty
All the Member States are party to the Geneva Conventions
Again I refer Parliament to the conclusions of its own STOA report of May 2001 , when it came to much the same conclusion in relation to this issue
On 6 March 2001 , the opinion of the Article 31 Exper@@ t Group was released to the press
W@@ id@@ es@@ pread intervention in the concerned regions was not required
Other reports issued by UN@@ EP on 13 March 2001 , the WHO on 1 May 2002 and the UK Royal Society on 12 March 2002 present similar conclusions
No single health effect related to depleted uranium has been observed
At European Union level the European Community efforts and the Member States ' activities combined total EUR 143 million
The European Union is , therefore , with the US , the top contributor in the fight against AP@@ L@@ s , including stockpile destruction and creation of local capac@@ ity-@@ building
In order to ensure sustainability over the years , the Commission approved in December 2002 the European Commission mine action strategy and multiannual indicative programming for the period 2002-@@ 2004
This document was prepared on the basis of strong coordination with the Member States , the United Nations , the US , and the wider mine action community
The Commission closely follows the debates of both groups
Currently , the opportunity to prepare a further common position on the suggestions tabled is being explored
Min@@ e-@@ clearance encompasses de jure and de facto clearance of other unexploded ord@@ n@@ ance , although this is not a specific sub@@ munitions instrument
We are already engaged in such broader clearance activities in countries such as Laos , Kosovo and Afghanistan , where the AP@@ L problem is inextricably connected to unexploded ord@@ n@@ ance pollution
For once , a technical expert is about to address the House on the subject , in particular , of depleted uranium weapons
On this point you have given us vital information and I simply want to add my own personal testimony
De@@ ple@@ ted uranium weapons are weapons which were developed in order to enable new types of arm@@ our-@@ plating to be pi@@ er@@ ced
The arm@@ our-@@ plating used in the Second World War was pi@@ er@@ ced by shells with a hollow charge , powered by chemical energy
New types of arm@@ our-@@ plating , however , can only be pi@@ er@@ ced by weapons powered by kin@@ e@@ tic energy
These are known as ar@@ row shells
It is important to be able to give them a high initial speed
They must also have heavy co@@ res
This is why depleted uranium is used
Here I must stress that the confusion which I am talking about is not innocent
Mr President , I can well imagine that the Commissioner is right about depleted uranium
However , as we know nothing about what long-term effects the dispersed material may have , there may be some surprises in store for us
I would like to say something about landmines
What we have to know about landmines that some 230 million of them are currently stored in a number of countries
Between 70 and 100 million of them have been laid around the world
I would like to encourage the Commission to make the right use of the funds that we have inserted in the Budget for research purposes
For my final comment , I turn to disarmament
There are other things - weapons of mass destruction , for example - that have to be disposed of
Every year , our Budget allocates some EUR 100 million to the disposal of chemical , biological and atomic weapons in the countries that formerly made up the Soviet Union
I would like you to submit a report on this , and for us to have a debate on it or produce a statement on the subject
After all , a great deal of money is involved and this is , above all , very much a live issue
Weapons such as landmines and cluster bombs are a veritable nightmare
Not only do they not discriminate between the military and innocent civilians , but after years of war they are still claiming victims among the population
These weapons must be taken out of the arsen@@ als for good
Unlike cluster bombs , there is an international ban on landmines
However , as long as non-@@ state actors are excluded from the banning process , there cannot be a world free of landmines
Based on its experiences with landmines , it is good that the European Commission is now also developing strategies and programmes for unexploded ammunition from wars
These new activities must not , however , be carried out at the expense of the campaign against land@@ min@@ es; extra money must be made available for this
Many people also think that weapons containing depleted uranium also pose a risk to public health
I am not reassured on that point yet
No matter , it is high time that we opened our eyes to the cluster bombs and that we finally woke up from our nightmare
Mr President , people throughout Europe will react with dis@@ belief and anger to the statement that there is no reason for anxiety in relation to depleted uranium weapons
It is tendentious to quote the Euratom Commission which exists explicitly to promote nuclear technology and whose radiation safety levels were originally set to allow atmospheric testing in the 1950s
Their anger is justified and is rising at the moment , because even low levels of al@@ pha radiation can have a severe effect on children
We know from testing that there are molec@@ ules of plutonium in these weapons that are isolated but can have an extremely severe effect when ingested
Sam@@ ples from six civilians near bombing targets in Afghanistan tested 100 times the normal level of uranium - contamination that stemmed from depleted uranium
Afghan doctors have cited deaths from internal ail@@ ments such as haem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ging , pul@@ mon@@ ary con@@ stric@@ tion and v@@ om@@ iting , which are all effects of radiation contamination
During the Gulf War , allied troops admitted using over 300 tonnes of depleted uranium
These are suspected to be a prime factor in the epidemic of birth defects , le@@ uka@@ emi@@ as and can@@ cers in Iraq
There is a difference between wet ground such as in Bosnia and desert conditions such as in Iraq and Afghanistan
I beg you not to have these children 's deaths on your conscience , Commissioner , but to react more humanly and more seriously to this really dreadful situation
These truths must not undermine our support for the application of humanitarian law to warfare and its development
That is why I welcome the negotiations on the question of unexploded ammunition left over from warfare
In particular , there is a need for clarification of the responsibility for unexploded bombs that are left behind
After all , unexploded bombs and shells continue to inj@@ ure many people long after the end of an armed conflict
The main role that I see for the European Commission is that of coordinating , informing and where necessary supporting Member States
Acc@@ um@@ ulation of powers tends to lead to confusion rather than to practical help for the victims
On the other hand the tension between justice and reality should make us cautious
Our respect for international treaties must not be allowed to degenerate into misuse of this field of the law for political purposes
After all , fac@@ ile censure ultimately undermines the support for the principles of combat
That is why I do not support the amendments of the Greens
They confine themselves to one-sided criticism of one single nation while the conduct of many countries is extremely dubious in the light of international humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts
Mr President , I refer to the motion for a resolution
anti-@@ tank mines , cluster bombs and depleted uranium munitions
I congratulate the Commission in its continuing work in this area
Our armed forces agreed that they could operate without anti-personnel landmines
Anti-@@ vehicle or anti-@@ tank mines are a different matter
Their humanitarian consequences are altogether less significant , and they are an indispensable military weapon as long as there are tanks on the battle field
Un@@ exploded ord@@ n@@ ance is a problem in post-conflict situations and more work needs to be done on self-@@ destruction and detection of munitions
The very words ' depleted uranium ' conjure up all sorts of fears and ideas related to radiation which seem to be wholly misplaced
It is recognised that there could be a small risk from toxic dust for those working unprotected in close proximity to a vehicle hit by depleted uranium ammunition
While I keep an open mind , there is currently no reliable medical evidence to link depleted uranium with ill health , either of troops or of local people
This resolution is not really about any of these things
It calls for an immediate moratorium on munitions which are key weapons for use by coalition air@@ forces and arm@@ oured forces currently deploying to the Gulf
It is no coincidence perhaps that it follows an Iraqi proposition in the UN last October which sought to designate depleted uranium as a weapon of mass destruction
This r@@ use was heavily defeated in the United Nations , only to re@@ appear now in the European Parliament
I hope that Members of this House will be very discriminating when they come to vote on the resolution tomorrow
Mr President , I have to confess that I am rather concerned and astonished after hearing the Commissioner 's statements
the suspicion that there may be chemical weapons
I will mention just three facts
Secondly , a statement by the US Secretary of State for Defence in January last year referred to an increase in radiation emissions from depleted uranium weapons in Afghanistan
Mr President , exactly this time last week I was in Bas@@ ra , in the south of Iraq , with my fellow colleagues on the Parliamentary delegation
I wish Tony Blair and George Bush had been at that hospital
The people of Iraq are still paying the price of the last war in can@@ cers , le@@ uka@@ emi@@ as and deaths
I wish Commissioner Byrne had been at that hospital too
The facts are there
If the methodologies cited by him cannot explain them , then I would suggest that his methodologies are wrong
Indeed , increasing numbers of scientists are demonstrating that the impact of low-@@ level radiation has been consistently underestimated
There are weaknesses in those methodologies
They are not right methodologies
By denying that , we do the people of Iraq a double disservice and the deaths go on
I have just one comment to make because a question was asked about Greece and the anti-personnel landmine convention
I should like to point out that the Greek Government has signed this convention
The convention was ratified by the Greek parliament and I did not understand the insin@@ uations or what exactly the two speakers were trying to say
Mr President , perhaps I might deal with a few of the issues that were addressed , particularly in relation to health matters
This issue , as I indicated earlier , has been considered not just by the Commission , and not just by the Council of Ministers , but also by Parliament
No association between the health problems of many Gulf War veterans , that is Gulf War Syn@@ dro@@ me , and suspected depleted uranium exposure could be found
In the case of German K@@ for soldiers in Kosovo potentially exposed to depleted uranium , it could be demonstrated that no significant intake had occurred
P@@ reli@@ min@@ ary results of a medical expertise show that the incidence of leukaemia among the Italian K@@ for troops is not significantly higher than the incidence in a reference population
The Commission came to exactly the same view when it considered these issues and studies , as did the Council
Having in mind the results provided by the medical observation over decades of workers in the uranium industry , as well as by the experiments with animals
The debate is closed
I should like to inform the House that I have received 6 motions for resolutions on this subject under Rule 42 of the Rules of Procedure
The proposal aims to contribute to the protection of the Community 's forests by means of monitoring
However , the proposal broadens the scope to include new environmental issues such as biodiversity , climate change , carbon sequ@@ e@@ stration and so@@ ils
The protection of forests and the enhancement of their multifunctional role are matters of particular importance and urgency in the Union
The Community and the Member States are committed to implementing internationally agreed activities and to set up monitoring and reporting systems
Sound political decisions have to be based on reliable information
We need harmonised and comprehensive long-term monitoring of forests at Community level
It is essential in order to provide information on the tempor@@ al and s@@ patial variation in the condition of forests
Experience from the previous forest monitoring scheme shows that the harmonisation of data collection is of major importance
There are two key issues which deserve special attention
Experience from the previous Community scheme shows that close cooperation between the Commission and the Member States is indeed needed to set up an efficient monitoring scheme
That is why the Commission proposed strengthening the comitology arrangements by incorporating a Management Committee
Our view is that the characteristics of the scheme proposed closely fit the criteria for management committees set out in the Council decision on comitology
Secondly , I would like to address the important aspect of forest fire prevention measures
Fi@@ res have affected forests in many parts of the Community , but in particular in the southern parts of the Community
The Commission fully understands Parliament 's concerns , which are reflected in those amendments concerning forest fire prevention measures
However , the Commission regrets that the incorporation of forest fire prevention measures within the ' F@@ orest F@@ oc@@ us ' proposal cannot be accepted
I should like to reassure Members that the approach proposed by the Commission will allow the continuity of the forest fire prevention measures
The Commission has already urged Member States to incorporate any necessary amendments to their national or regional rural development plans
The question of the budget increase is linked to the issue of fire prevention measures
It follows that just as the Commission does not support additional fire prevention measures within the proposal , nor does it support the proposed budget increase
In other words , it became subject to approval by co-decision
Actions in the sixth framework action programme in the field of the environment which the European Commission and the Community are obliged to implement
However , the proposal replaces the majority of the measures on fire prevention in the former Regulation No 2@@ 15@@ 8/@@ 92
Now , the Commissioner has just told us that these measures are included in the rural and regional development programmes which he mentioned
It will therefore have to appear in order to balance the 2002 budget
That is , EUR 18 million per year
Now , Commissioner , we are spending EUR 18 million
The Commission proposes EUR 13 million
It appears that it has not been possible for the Commission to reach this agreement
I believe that we all have to make a move , not just Parliament
Of the amendments presented by the Group of the European Socialist Party , this rapporteur accepts Amendment No 48
However , Amendment No 47 is not acceptable since it would go against the spirit of the report
I would say , to use rather un@@ orthodox terms for a plenary session , that this would be like leaving a sweet at the gates of a school
Commissioner , we have time to clarify both the budget and the harmony of these regulations
Mr President , Mrs Redondo Jiménez has drawn up an excellent and comprehensive report on the monitoring of forests and environmental inter@@ actions , for which I thank her sincerely
The Commission proposal combines two former regulations , one of which concerns the protection of the forests from air pollution and the other forest fire prevention
The Committee on Budgets has delivered an opinion on this matter
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy , however , raised this financial framework of EUR 52 million to EUR 67 million
This is meant as a guiding principle for the plenary debate , which of course is free to take its own decision
This week Rule 6@@ 3@@ a is being applied not only to this report but also to that by U@@ lla Sandbæk , for example
It should be noted that if the committee responsible increases the financial framework in question it must once again request an opinion from the Committee on Budgets
Ver@@ ification of compatibility does on no account constitute a position on whether the proposal by the committee responsible regarding a larger financial framework is appropriate or reasonable
This procedure will hopefully become automatic and natural
The plenary session must have knowledge regarding the compatibility of the financial framework with the financial perspective so that it can take its decision
The procedure increases the responsibility of the committees responsible for the legislative proposal being debated at the time
Ac@@ ti@@ vit@@ y-based budgeting , which is already established , also has the same objective
You took account of the substance of our opinion at the preparatory stage when you were doing your own preparatory work
This unrealistic attitude was particularly apparent in the targets for measuring biodiversity , calculating the frequency of occurrence of species
It would be wise to investigate the situation first and then see
I would in this connection like to point out that forests vary greatly in different parts of the EU and forests and timber mean very different things in different countries
It is owing to these differences that I have strong reservations about any forestry policy being managed from Brussels
Mr President , Commissioner , I should like first of all to express my support for the report by Mrs Redondo Jiménez
They are essential to us , amongst other things in order to prevent climate change
However , we should not regard forest areas solely as the lungs of Europe
They are not just green sp@@ ac@@ es; they are also a not in@@ considerable source of economic , social and tourism activity
This is why the monitoring of forests should not be the sole responsibility of the European Union
and the Union and local operators represented within the European Advisory Committee on Fore@@ stry and Cork and the Standing Fore@@ stry Committee
The Council has a responsibility to take on here
The Commission is proposing that repair measures following forest fires should be reinforced
I totally agree with this important step , but I would also ask that research into the causes of such fires should be reinforced
Re@@ pair should not be the sole objective of long-term management
That is why I believe that forests should definitely come within the scope of the codecision procedure
Mr President , it is important for us to look after the forests in Europe
There are tasks in this area that we can deal with jointly at European Union level
As we develop the measures to be taken we nevertheless have to remember that the importance of forests varies greatly in different parts of Europe
The forests themselves are also different
For this reason any questions relating to forestry must be regarded as being based on the principle of subsidiarity
Neither should we develop new institutions
The tasks contained in the EU 's forestry action plan must be dealt with within the context of present systems , making use of existing monitoring methods
At Union level responsibility must lie with the Commission and the European Environment Agency
The Commission must also work in close cooperation with the Standing Fore@@ stry Committee
I do , however , think it problematic that the rapporteur has included measures relating to forest fire prevention in this regulation
The Group of the Party of European Socialists agrees that forest fire prevention is an important part of European collaboration and a matter that requires solidarity among us
The difference of opinion is connected , however , with how this should be financed
The PSE Group has tabled Amendment No 47 which aims to guarantee that all operational sectors are taken into account equally in this regulation
It is not until we have discovered this that we can decide what sort of increase the budget needs
At this stage we shall oppose the increase in the budget referred to above
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to begin with a timely and relevant saying
In view of all of this , we must recognise the importance today of the report by Mrs Redondo Jiménez for nature in the European Union
I believe there are various reasons for this
But all of this could come to n@@ ought if the Commission does not allocate the funding needed to adopt the measures necessary to achieve an appropriate European policy on forests
I congratulate the rapporteur on her sensitivity to the problem of forests and on her courage in defending the Community forests
6 million , which demonstrates the importance of this Regulation
I therefore agree with the amendments tabled by the rapporteur , seeking to uphold fire prevention actions
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to thank Mrs Redondo Jiménez for this report
Our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance can support this report in its entirety and without reservation
We therefore give the report our full support and hope that the Member States will be able to get down to work as soon as possible
My thanks again to all those who have given their assistance
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , year after year Portuguese forests are the silent victims of fires , which are becoming increasingly frequent , intense and devastating
Our forest heritage is gradually burning down and disappearing
Sustainable forest management is becoming increasingly complex and technical
Apart from fires , forests are exposed to other , more recent threats , caused by atmospheric pollution and climate change
It is always worth reminding fellow Members and making them aware of the importance of forests and their resources
I therefore warmly welcome the F@@ orest F@@ oc@@ us Programme , a Community initiative that will help to protect and value forests in Portugal and throughout the Community
European Union policy dove@@ tails perfectly with cooperation in gathering data and in sharing experience and information amongst the various Member States
For this programme 's financial support , it has been decided to allocate it a multiannual financial framework , covering the period 2003-@@ 2008 , totalling EUR 67 million
Monitoring is actually the key word in this proposal
I therefore heartily support Mrs Redondo Jiménez 's idea that it makes perfect sense to maintain specific measures for fire protection and rural development
I also agree that this proposal must cover the commitments given in the Convention on Climate Change , which portrays forests as sinks full of greenhouse gases
Even more serious is the fact that the Commission proposal does not cover the measures to prevent forest fires previously funded under Regulation No 2@@ 15@@ 8/@@ 92
I therefore support all the amendments to the proposal that are intended to give the Member States greater involvement
Consequently , the best formula is no doubt the one referred to by Mrs Grossetête , in other words codecision , or development towards codecision , in matters concerning forests
I live in a region in the south of France , in which great efforts are being made , in terms of investment , to prevent forest fires
I am sorry that a policy which works is being changed
Moreover , it was a safety policy
I believe that this is a deplorable step backwards
I am afraid that if , one day , we have disasters in the south of our continent , the public will blame us
We are always saying that we want to be closer to the people , that Europe should have solidarity , that Europe should be on the side of Europeans
Yet in this extremely sensitive area , for which there was a procedure which worked well and was particularly well appreciated , Europe is now becoming invisible
It is removing this procedure from its policies and is renationalising it under the heading of a particularly risky policy of rural development
I hope , Commissioner , that you will reconsider your initial proposals , explaining that they will not be supported by the Commission
Mr President , I wish to thank our fellow MEP , Mrs Redondo Jiménez , for the sterling work she has done
We cannot , however , support the third part relating to common monitoring of biodiversity
What is more , no one can now say what is meant by biodiversity in a European perspective
If the Commission is asked what there is by way of a common forestry policy in Europe , the answer is that no such policy exists
If the Commission then repeatedly introduces new monitoring tools into this area , a policy is created in secrecy , and that is unacceptable
This is also an issue of ownership
The issue of compensation is at present an issue for each Member State
Where is the logic in this whole decision ?
Mr President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Redondo on the magnificent work she has done on her report
In view of the obvious deterioration of the forests , I believe you should be sensitive to Mrs Redondo 's proposals
With regard to these regions we must continue to develop and expand a specific policy and we must combat forest fires
Prevention and safety are very important in terms of maintaining all the European forests , above all in view of the characteristics of the southern forests
It is essential that the Commission take note and that it be sensitive to this report and our speeches defending the forests
It is therefore hard to understand why this Commission proposal excludes the cofinancing of measures to prevent forest fires , measures that were previously funded under Regulation 2@@ 15@@ 8/@@ 92
Therefore , if we wish seriously to preserve the forests of southern Europe , we will have to provide for the funding of fire prevention measures
Unless forests are protected from fires , there is no point in talking about biodiversity , because when fires occur , they burn down everything
Neither plants nor animals survive
Tens of thousands of hectares burn down every year in Portugal and in other Mediterranean countries
Parliament has been sensitive to this scourge and has therefore proposed - and I hope will adopt - the amendments presented to us by Mrs Redondo Jiménez
Unless the Council is able to understand this , doubts will remain as to its ability to understand the reality of the situation of Europe 's forests
I thank and congratulate Mrs Redondo Jiménez , who has guided us through this matter extremely ably , with great skill and tenacity
Mr President , Commissioner , I , too , am sincerely grateful to the rapporteur , Mrs Redondo
The way that this new proposal F@@ orest F@@ oc@@ us combines two old demands , that wood@@ land be protected against environmental pollution and against fires , meets with my fundamental approval
Two years ago , we ran a conference on this subject in Brussels
In my homeland , Commissioner , young farmers no longer have any interest in wood@@ lands or in forestry
The property rights of wood@@ land farmers are constantly being eroded
Why should a fore@@ ster give his all without getting financial compensation , often without his efforts even being recognised by society ?
If we say yes to it , F@@ orest F@@ oc@@ us will have to cover the social , economic and ecological fields in Europe
Bi@@ o-@@ diversity and monitoring have a nice sound to them , but they do not give wood@@ land farmers any financial entitlements in respect of the work they do
Let me say in conclusion that it is not those who are constantly discussing wood@@ lands who are engaged in caring for nature and protecting it
Even now , they are no longer prepared to clear up storm damage , for they take the line that this is a luxury they cannot afford
Let us not start imposing more and more new demands on them
Let us help to clean up the air
Let us help provide compensatory measures as well , so that they can do such things as fertil@@ ising the soil with manure and lime
Mr President , firstly I should like to finalise my remarks concerning the amendments
I am pleased to say that there are 31 amendments which the Commission can fully support in part or in principle
Concerning the discussion about the financial issue of the EUR 5 million , the budget line available for the regulations on atmospheric pollution and forest fires also covered the EF@@ IC@@ S
This amount has been reallocated between F@@ orest F@@ oc@@ us - EUR 13 million - and EF@@ IC@@ S - EUR 3 million - to cover the monitoring needs related to forests
As the rural development budget and provisions cover the measures on forest fire prevention , it was not deemed necessary to transfer additional resources to the rural development regulation
This type of transfer cannot guarantee that the available resources are not reat@@ tribu@@ ted only to the Member States that have been recipients under the fire prevention regulation in the past
I have taken careful note of the views expressed in the debate , but I must stand by my previous remarks about the Commission 's views on these issues
That is far away , Commissioner , and I believe that it is now the Commission which is obliged to make an effort
It has just told us that the prevention of fires is already included
I would ask , ' where ? ' , Commissioner
We have discussed it many tim@@ es; and as for the E@@ FI@@ S , this is an issue which is still being considered and which does not have so many arguments
We have just seen the Commission run out of arguments
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
I therefore consider that the Commission 's proposed ' F@@ orest F@@ oc@@ us ' places the emphasis on the right direction
If you cannot stop the fires , what is the point in monitoring the forests ?
I therefore suggest that attention should be given to continuing and increasing funding for preventive measures
N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ ing countries need to cooperate , so that they can prevent and fight fires efficiently , because fires do not recognise and more often than not cut across borders
I thank the rapporteur , Mrs Sandbæk , for her efforts to secure adoption at first reading
In some countries , for example Mal@@ awi , maternal mortality is increasing
I find this unacceptable and we , as Europeans , need to show our commitment to improving this situation
It will serve to develop local partnerships with the different actors and , where appropriate , contribute to regional or global initiatives
First of all , I would like to thank the two shadow rapporteurs , Mrs Martens and Mrs Sauquillo , for their great cooperation
I would also like to thank the Commission , the Council and the secretariat
This regulation replaces a former one that expired in December last year
It was necessary to try to get this regulation adopted at first reading
Without the cooperation of all these actors this would not have been possible
For the same reason , it is only necessary to adopt those amendments that have been agreed upon among these actors
This is , as Commissioner Nielson mentioned , a very important regulation
Every minute of every day , 380 women become pregnant
Of them , one woman dies
One hundred and ninety women have unwanted pregn@@ anci@@ es; 110 women face a pregn@@ anc@@ y-@@ related problem; 40 women have unsafe abortions
It is a fact that pregnancy and child@@ birth are the leading cause of death and disability for women in the developing countries
Every year 600 000 women die as a direct result of getting pregnant
An estimated 30 % to 40 % more are left with serious complications
This is appalling , especially since at least 75 % of all deaths and injuries could be prevented through basic and affordable reproductive health care measures
This is what reproductive health care and rights are all about - saving women 's lives
The regulation specifically underlines that abortion should never be used as a means of contraception
The regulation also emphasises that everything possible should be done to avoid abortions
In fact , it has been proved that in those countries where reproductive health care was introduced , the abortion rate dropped by 25 % immediately
This has , for instance , been the case in Russia
A lot of allegations have been made against this report
It has been implied that this regulation could leave the door open to use abortion as a means of contraception or even birth control
It has even been implied that this regulation would be used to keep down the number of the poor
The use of condoms has been compared to playing Russian roulette
Those are just a few examples of what this regulation has been accused of
The Commissioner has already mentioned that this is a follow-up to the Cairo programme which was signed by all of our Member States , and that is exactly so
Moreover , it has become a very balanced report
It puts a lot of emphasis on education
It puts a lot of emphasis on coun@@ selling
Nobody who reads this report can doubt that it never recommends abortion
We cannot leave a woman in the Third World to die because she has an unwanted pregnancy
I have been travelling extensively in Africa
Wherever I have travelled I have visited small clinics for reproductive health and rights
These clinics are the only place people can go to be tested for HIV-@@ AIDS
if they have malaria , then the malaria is treated
It is extremely important to have centres for reproductive health and rights
The HIV-@@ AIDS issue is one of the reasons why we have asked to have the amount of money raised compared to the last regulation
It is very important that a woman can be tested to see whether she is HIV positive
It is very important that a woman can have coun@@ selling as to how she can protect herself against HIV-@@ AIDS
You cannot fight poverty without sexual and reproductive health care
I am very happy that we have raised the amount , in comparison with the last regulation
I am very pleased that we have now secured the consensus reached so pain@@ st@@ ak@@ ingly at the UN Conference in Cairo and which is soon to have its 10@@ th anniversary
It will not be possible to increase the amount proposed without reducing other policies in the same heading , because the financial ceiling has already been reached
The Committee on Development , for its part , has increased the amount without requesting the opinion of the Committee on Budgets
And I have already said that I am not going to get into assessing the fundamental aspects of the report
Mr President , we too , the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities , have been able to discuss this regulation
Moreover , we have had plenty of time to do so , for the opinion was , I believe , expressed last September
Indeed , we were aware of the importance of not leaving a gap between the adoption of a new regulation and the expiry of the previous one
We are convinced that reproductive health problems are also closely linked to issues of poverty and underdevelopment
We therefore believe that it is only by pursuing this line that they can be resolved
Mr President , we are discussing an important matter
Every year 100 000 women die of complications during or following pregnancy , the overwhelming majority of them in developing countries
Very much larger numbers are involved when you include people suffering from sexu@@ ally-@@ transmitted diseases such as HIV and AIDS
This programme is about the whole range of problems
The EU wants to do something about this urgent state of affairs
The programme is geared , therefore , to the treatment and prevention of disease and infection , the reduction of maternal mortality and the prevention of abortion
Commissioner Nielson guaranteed to the Commission once again in a letter that these are not included in the policy of the Commission
Some fear misuse of the scheme but I cannot read the report as promoting abortion
It is a sensitive issue , with opinions divided even in our group , and the text that has been produced is a compromise
Exam@@ ination of the problem clearly shows that it cannot be solved solely by emphasising rights , provisions and resources
The text clearly states that there will be no support for the promotion of sterilisation and abortion
We have negotiated to reach a solution quickly so as not to have to stop programmes unnecessarily
It is unfortunate that the Commission was rather late with its proposal , which meant that we had to complete the whole process so quickly
I assume that we can count on the full support of the Council and the Commission after this long process of negotiation
I would like to thank all those who cooperated with us in such a constructive way
Mr President , I would , first , like to congratulate Mrs Sandbæk on her report , which has achieved a broad consensus on a controversial issue
Re@@ productive health is one of the fundamental aspects of development and principally , but not solely , affects the developing countries
In those countries , pregnancies and bir@@ ths are the main cause of death and illness amongst women , as has been said previously
That conference represented great progress , by correcting the political view of population which traditionally focussed on demographic objectives , and since then it has focussed on women 's rights
No less than 179 countries agreed to an action plan on this new basis
The European Union must be generous
We will vote tomorrow in favour of the amendments relating to funding and against any other amendment that may affect the content of this report
I would like to raise two points
My first point is of a financial nature
The main problem is that the financing is lagging behind the IC@@ P@@ D objectives , with , in addition to President Bush 's decrease , the fact that 0
7 % ODA has not been reached
Taking all those things together , this means that many programmes cannot be implemented
That is why , Commissioner , the financial section in this proposal is immensely important
does the Council agree with this proposal ?
We consider it very important that agreement is reached at first reading , and this amendment may put that in jeopardy
A second point concerns the anti-@@ abortion actions being conducted in relation to this issue
There is a lobby group in America screaming blue murder because they say this European regulation promotes abortion
They say it supports the Chinese policy of forced abortion as a means of stemming population growth
It is all nonsense
Of course we are against the Chinese practice , just as we were against the forced sterilisation of men in India in the time of Mrs G@@ and@@ hi
The decision to have an abortion must be taken freely by women but not seen as an alternative to proper methods of contraception
The proposal as it now lies before us is also entirely in keeping with the principles adopted in 1994 in Cairo
I eagerly await your response
Mr President , no one can now continue to deny the link between poverty and the lack of any rights with regard to reproduction and sexuality
Nor can anyone continue to plead ignorance regarding the ways in which , in certain countries , women 's rights on these matters are abused
The undertakings given at the International Conference on Pop@@ ulation and Development held in Cairo should be maintained and honoured
This debate , and I would like to thank our rapporteur for her work on the subject , has to remain serious
The emancipation of women and the full development of everyone requires rights and actions
As for the right to abortion , it still has to be defended , and for some women , including some in Europe , it still has to be acquired
Finally , I think the time has finally come to make more funding available for that proportion of development aid which is spent on health and education
That is why I support the amount of funding proposed by Mrs Sandbæk in her report
This has to do with the fact that the right to autonomous control over your body , your fertil@@ ity and reproduction has never been completely accepted
In some circles people evidently still do not understand that women cannot be denied this right
Nor men either , but there has always been more sympathy for that in the past
When we consider the situation today , we see big differences in theory and in practice
Up to now we have not seen this as a collective problem
But in any case we know that very many women would like more children than the average 1
4 per family that , for example , is reached in Belgium
In the third world it tends to be the other way round
The situation is very grave
Of course the children have different fathers who do not care about the women or the children
But I was talking about the social implications
But your regulation is absolutely not targeting those large-scale societal phenomena
I heard of a case of Roma women who are steril@@ ised against their will at the moment they give birth
All this results from ignorance , of course , but it mainly due to gr@@ inding poverty
We will make every effort to get these financial resources increased in the future and to see that they are used well
In view of the spread of AIDS , it has to be said that all our resources are insufficient at the moment
Now fortunately we have the means to prevent this dreadful disease being passed from mother to child
Mr President , I should like to say a few brief words to present the amendments tabled by my group and to ask for the support of the House
is the European Union going to fund abortion worldwide or not ?
This is a key aspect of the text on which we will vote
I know that in substance our views are different and that laws differ from one Member State to another
I do not want to open a debate that is not in the competence of the Union
We cannot accept , however , that European Union funds would be applied in abor@@ tion-@@ oriented policies
The matter still requires clarification
The official policy of the EU must be open and clear to everyone , not disguised or covered up
Am@@ bi@@ gu@@ ity is very wrong here
Our Amendments 49 and 53 are in the direction of clarification
I would be even happier if I could be reassured tonight
The EU should not promote abortion
There are details that raise concern
This raises concerns
Who adopted such a biased and tw@@ isted definition in the Commission and what are the implications ?
It is not a secret that an NGO , Marie St@@ opes International , actively worked with Parliament to prepare this legislation
Once out and in the open this , though a bit awkward , might not be such a big problem
This raises huge concerns
The apparent active involvement of Marie St@@ opes in the preparation of this legislation reinforces the need for crystal clear clarification in our debate and in the text of the regulation
That is what we are asking for in Amendments 49 and 53
First , abortion is not a Community competence , being too far away from the aims of development cooperation ever to become a Community competence via that route
The second reason why abortion may not be a Community policy concerns the supplementary nature of the policy
The report also lacks clarity because it fails to define reproductive health
Does the definition of the World Health Organisation apply ?
This includes termination of pregnancy and therefore abortion
Amendments Nos 49 and 53 deserve strong support because they clearly rule out abortion
Moreover the organisations implementing the Community policy are not unequivocal in their efforts to reduce abortion
They actually have so-called ' safe abortion ' as one of their objectives
However , the greatest potential for improving health is not in abortion but in a different area
The report states that 13 % of maternal mortality is caused by so-called ' unsafe abortion ' , as if there was such a thing a safe abortion
This means that 87 % has a different cause
Better care during pregnancy and better health care in general would therefore reduce maternal mortality considerably
The 13 % caused by so-called ' unsafe abortion ' can also be brought down , through more compassionate coun@@ selling of women with unwanted pregnancies
Next the share of the budget taken by the report is unbalanced
The annual budget of EUR 20 million represents a doubling of what was spent last year
That will be at the expense of other budget headings
Figu@@ res from the UN population fund show that people worldwide have better access to contrac@@ ep@@ tives than to clean water
In short , we are setting the wrong priorities
Finally , hopeful developments can be seen in several African countries in reducing sexu@@ ally-@@ transmitted diseases , due to education that emphasises fi@@ de@@ lity in marriage and ab@@ stin@@ ence
Is the Commission aware of these positive results ?
I ask this question again because the Commission did not answer it during the debate on hunger , trade and the role of HIV/AIDS in that
I refer to Uganda and Zambia
In South Africa beneficial effects have also been acknowledged
Fide@@ lity in marriage and ab@@ stin@@ ence produce better results than the present secular European morality
I eagerly await Commissioner Nielson 's response
We European women are lucky in that we are able to complete a pregnancy , have access to information and reconcile family life with professional life
How can we accept the fact that so many women experience difficulties which we in Europe are spared ?
However , we must not allow ourselves to make our aid conditional upon family planning
It would be absurd to impose our model on these women
It is vital to help these women to organise their society , their lives as women and mothers , in accordance with their traditions , their values and their culture
Moreover , we cannot reduce issues involving women 's rights merely to those issues involving reproduction and sexuality
These women are pillars of their society
Mrs Sandbæk , you tell us that abortion will never be a form of contraception
In order to convince us , your report should have been more precise
In this way I hope that these women will be able to exercise their responsibilities in complete freedom and without any pressure from our Western model
In any such sensitive issue , no one will be completely happy with the outcome
It would be a tragedy for sick women in developing countries if this report were delayed in any way because of budget technicalities
The facts speak for themselves
At least 75 % of all maternal deaths and injuries could and should be prevented through reproductive health care
Re@@ productive health in the context of this report covers all areas related to reproduction and associated diseases such as HIV-@@ AIDS
I sincerely hope that honourable Members of this House will support this report
In order to explain the true significance and importance of approving this report it is necessary to highlight certain crucial aspects
It is not possible to be in favour of life and then deny women in developing countries their right to information and to controlling their sexuality and reproductive capacity
In the developing countries female mortality relating to pregnancy and child@@ birth is 33 times greater than that in the industrialised countries
Re@@ productive health services are included amongst the indicators selected for evaluating the millennium development objectives
B@@ ad health leads to higher pregnancy rates and condemns families to poverty
In 2015 there will be 7@@ 42 million people requiring sexual and reproductive health services or supplies
Control of their sexuality is a woman 's right , but this is only recognised in the rich countries
The illnesses and consequences which women in the poor countries suffer principally originate from their reproductive role
F@@ emin@@ ine health is an essential element if the poor countries are to make progress
Mr President , this is indeed an issue of the utmost importance
These efforts are all the more noteworthy because of the vague suspicions and frustrated attempts to include groundless justifications in the guidelines in question
Nor should it be swept under the carpet in this context that pregnancy and child@@ birth are the main causes of death and disability of women in less-@@ developed countries
Nor should it be forgotten that a major proportion of mater@@ nit@@ y-@@ linked deaths in those countries are closely linked to abortions carried out in unsafe conditions
These are undeniable and enormously serious occurrences that must be ended by means of appropriate measures , such as those now being responsibly proposed
This is also why means are also necessary and these have been clearly insufficient
This is why it is essential to make an effort , with the European Union leading the way
I fully support efforts by the European Union to improve health and sanitary conditions for women in these countries
This is why it is so important that the European Union helps to improve the health facilities in these countries
The Cairo agreement states that abortion cannot be promoted as a family planning method , and that regulations regarding abortion are solely for individual countries to decide upon
I am fully satisfied that this draft regulation on sexual and reproductive rights fully complies with the requirements laid down by the Cairo agreement
I am aware that the Irish Government is very vigilant in monitoring the terms of this proposal
I also want to state , in the clearest possible language , my strong commitment to defending the rights of children and the unborn
The European Union has no power whatsoever to deal with the issue of abortion , which rightly remains the sole preserve of individual Member States
There is nothing this report can do to propose a change in this legal position
The WHO estimates that 8@@ 8-@@ 98 % of all maternal deaths are avoidable if women have access to proper reproductive and ob@@ ste@@ tric health services
Recently on a visit to Rwanda I learned that 2 000 women die per 100 000 live bir@@ ths
In my own country , the United Kingdom , that figure is seven
M@@ ater@@ nal mortality continues to rise in developing countries
Women die from haem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ging , from infections , from high blood pressure , from obstructed labour
They also die from unsafe abortions
The last speaker talked about the rights of governments to choose
I would emphasise that women in these situations also have the right to choose
Providing for reproductive health is not a euphemism for abortion services
Women have the right to reliable information and to compassionate coun@@ selling
We must at all costs avoid being drawn into debates which are only about us reflecting United States domestic policy
The reality is that if we do not receive a positive vote tomorrow , there will be no budget line
We will be guilty of turning our backs on a maternal car@@ n@@ age such as we see in developing countries
Is that the signal we want to send from this Parliament to the suffering women of the developing world ?
North and south need to work together on everything from the country strategy papers which we produce with developing countries to prioritising gender issues and reproductive health and rights
Finally , I should like to say that it is very important that we have an understanding of gender and reproductive rights as a cross-cutting issue
It is revol@@ ting , in fact , that pregnancy and giving birth should be among the principal causes of death and injury among women living in developing countries
It is also revol@@ ting to find that AIDS and , more generally , sexu@@ ally-@@ transmitted diseases , affect poor countries much more than developed countries
Consequently , the proposals which have been put forward seem quite derisory as a means of dealing with this situation
Moreover , the failings noted in these proposals are not merely connected with the in@@ sufficiency of the funding proposed for the implementation of a health policy for poor countries
Therefore , within the framework of a global policy to combat poverty , the aspects relating to sexual and reproductive health demand special attention
And I would hope , Commissioner , that you also share this approach
Mr President , I congratulate Mrs Sandbæk and also Commissioner Nielson for his clear political direction on this issue
His very significant decision to substitute the funding through UN@@ F@@ PA that the Bush Administration wrongly withdrew is a hallmark of his distinguished record as Commissioner for Development
The European Union and Parliament , this week , have been subject to fundamentally misleading lobbying and publicity concerning the purpose of this regulation
As colleagues across the House have made clear , the regulation clearly incorporates the Cairo Agreement that specifically prohibits abortion as a method of family planning
This is also absolutely essential to halt the spread of HIV-@@ AIDS , which currently kills 8 000 people every day
This is about saving lives , not about losing them
Men as well as women must take responsibility for sexual health
One has to recall that 160 Members denied us the qualified majority , and EUR 6 million was lost
That money would have helped over 2 million women around the world to have safe pregnancy and birth
I hope that tomorrow we will be able to reinstate this funding , subject to the agreement of our budget colleagues
In April my own partner is expecting our second baby
I do not see why any mother , anywhere in the world , should not have the right to the same protection
That is why I will support this vote and call on others to do so
I myself spent some time working as a doctor in Guatemala , an impoverished developing country , where I could see how necessary such aid is
I believe that we are under an obligation to bring to these women 's attention what options are available by way of contraception
We are also , for example , under an obligation to increase the availability of condoms
I would ask the Commissioner to reconsider that
It is also my belief that ' contraception and birth control ' is not just an issue of concern to women alone
I do believe that we have to give more support to science in its search for contrac@@ ep@@ tives for men
An international consortium has submitted an application in this area to the 6th research framework programme , but the Commission has , unfortunately , not considered it yet
Abortion is a sensitive subject , and rightly so
When I was , for five years , a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation , I constantly heard the Commission saying that there was not enough money
That was why they rejected many projects put before us by NGOs - projects that were not in the least controversial , and which everyone said we should support
I think Amendment No 53 expresses this very appropriately
I am glad that this report has been successfully focussed on the prevention of unwanted pregnancy and on the provision of real help for women
Above all , I wish to thank Mrs Martens for her great commitment
Mr President , I am glad that Mrs S@@ call@@ on is in the House tonight and that she is listed to speak
They are s@@ cur@@ r@@ il@@ ous lies that should be re@@ tracted
We should have an apology here tonight from Mrs S@@ call@@ on for promoting these fal@@ se@@ hoods
I believe it is the responsibility of every man and woman to choose the number of children and the sp@@ ac@@ ing of their children , as and when they choose
It is not for me to decide or for Mrs S@@ call@@ on to decide
It is for each individual to decide
There are 600 000 women this year who will die , who probably have other children , certainly parents and certainly lovers or hus@@ bands who want them to live
We are being asked to deny them the right to life
The attitude of Mrs S@@ call@@ on and President Bush is based on hear@@ tless , theological hair@@ -@@ splitting which has nothing to do with life
Mr President , I would like to thank all those who have worked so hard to try to reach a good compromise
some definitions within this regulation are not clear enough
In order to do this to the best of our ability , we should support , in particular , Amendment 53
There is no conflict presented by the wording of this amendment
It is in keeping with the compromise reached and the expressed opinion of the Commission and Council
The European Parliament has very often decided in favour of this very same wording
As we are all aware , the European Union has no legal competence to decide on or to fund abortion in Member States
There is no conflict presented by the wording of this amendment
It will clarify beyond doubt the intentions of this Parliament , the Commission and Council
For these reasons , I would respectfully ask for support for Amendment 53
The amendments voted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation have received wide support and strengthen and clarify the text of the regulation , without altering its main objectives
The Commission welcomes them
However , I do not see this as something that should lead to a second reading
I am confident that we will find a solution
We are on very firm ground in what is happening here
We are not discussing abortion policy in European Member States
We are discussing development policy and we are proposing to do what is clearly in line with what has been internationally agreed
This is the purpose of all this
I warn against changing this discussion into something totally different
Mr Ribeiro e Castro said that Amendment 49 is about clarification
It is a change of the substance
We may not have this meeting taking place in full day@@ light , but I find it light enough in here to make the following remark
In the existing text , no support is to be given under this regulation to incentives to encourage sterilisation or abortion
' no support is to be given under this regulation to sterilisation or abortion , nor to ? '
This is not a clarification
This is a change of the substance
A spade should be called a spade and a text should be called a text
In reply to some of the other remarks made by Mr Ribeiro e Castro , I warn against throwing around quotes which are very difficult to verify
This debate has already had an overdose of that sort of input
To Mr Ó Ne@@ ach@@ tain I say that I can subscribe to his observations
They are a precise account of the reality and the formalities of the issue , as stated
Anything other than what is now emerging here as the consensus from the Committee on Development and Cooperation represents an unacceptable deviation from Cairo
I advise that we stay on track
That is another good reason for the European Parliament and the European Union to stay on track
I hope that we will be able to stay on track on this issue
Mr President , I would like to defend my honour
I do not believe that the Commissioner insul@@ ted me , nor that he intended to insult me
I should like to say on record that I will be happy to send the Commissioner the papers from which I quoted during my speech
The Commission would then have an opportunity to read them in their entirety , something which , of course , I was unable to do in plenary
I find that absolutely acceptable , but the point is not whether Mr Ribeiro e Castro was quoting correctly
The problem is whether what is being quoted is correct
I just gave the warning that we have seen quite a lot of input to this debate which calls for great scepticism
That was my well-intentioned warning
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
We feel Mrs Sand@@ ba@@ ek , Mrs Martens and Mrs Ferrer 's work is satisfactory , considering the different starting points
We should always be mindful of our ability to produce texts which require respect for human rights , inviolability , self-determination and responsib@@ il@@ isation of the individual as a priority
The violent practice of abortion should therefore be excluded as a general means of family planning
A regulation whose objective is to protect health cannot contradict itself and attack life , the supreme good of the individual from the moment of conception
Another general consideration is countries ' approach to these instruments , which reflect the responsibility that every State , every community and every individual should feel to protect life
The culture of the hierarchy of force must be eliminated once and for all during the Third Millennium
The Third Millennium is characterised by the culture of information and knowledge and , therefore , must provide the conditions for free exchange between minds
Women must be able to dialogue with men without being affected by any form of sex@@ ism
On behalf of all my colleagues on the committee , I hope that we can request the services to give the internal market a rather more prominent place in future
As you said in your introduction , my report is about the Commission 's strategy paper , De@@ li@@ vering the Pro@@ m@@ ise
That will be very much the theme of my speech
She has now gone on to higher things as the Foreign Minister of Spain
I have had the pleasure of working on this report by a happy coincidence during the time when the 10@@ th anniversary of the internal market was marked
We were very pleased to welcome Commissioner Bolkestein and Mr Ben@@ son , the chairman of the Competitiveness Council , to Parliament back in November 2002
I would like to thank them both for enthusiastically promoting the cause of the internal market during that time
In his speech then Mr Bolkestein asked us to produce an ambitious and hard-@@ hitting report
I think I have managed that , but I could not have done it without a lot of support from my colleagues
You will see tomorrow that I am confident this report will get the overwhelming support of the House
We have incorporated a number of his points
I hope he feels that we have done justice to his work as well
I am slightly disappointed that the Liberal benches tonight are empty
I hope that their absence means that they are content with the work we have done
However , since they are of your political family , Commissioner , I hope you will draw that to their attention tomorrow
I will highlight some of the points in this report
It is no coincidence that we have timed it now , in the run-up to the economic summit and following on the debate we had this morning
We want the ' delivery gap ' - a phrase that you appropriately used , Commissioner - to be closed
We want the new Competitiveness Council to address the issues seriously and make a difference
Naturally , we want the deficit revealed on your sco@@ re@@ boards in Member States ' transposition to be closed
We also want to see quicker and more effective action taken where the Rules are being flouted
As part of the Better Regulation Initiative , we want to deal with the problems of over-@@ complex , gold plating of internal market regulations
We also want internal market compatibility to be introduced as part of the assessment process
We urge you to move forward quickly with the Internal Market for Services strategy
It is clear that will be a difficult measure , but it is a vital one
It will include important elements of mutual recognition , alongside harmonisation
We want the Member States to take a much more mature attitude to using mutual recognition alongside other weapons as a measure to create the single market
In our committee , we are absolutely dismayed that the sales promotion regulation , an ideal single market mutual recognition measure is still blocked in Council
We hope you will take that message back as well
I want to conclude with two important points
That is something in which we want to involve consumers , businesses , Member governments and Commissioners in the quest to make the internal market work better
We have been ambitious and hard hitting
We invite the Council to take the same approach
Mr President , this is a very important topic , one of the bases on which the European Union rests
Last November , I challenged Parliament to come up with bold new ideas for improving the internal market
The Harbour report more than meets that challenge
Ten years of the internal market have given us 2
Too many barriers are still holding us back
Enlargement makes it all the more urgent to clear the dec@@ ks
The emphasis in that medium-term Internal Market Strategy - a document that the Commission will present in April - is on going ' back to basics '
Fore@@ most among this move ' back to basics ' is the matter of implementation and enforcement
I welcome Parliament 's support for strengthening the Commission 's enforcement powers in the future IGC
The Harbour report also calls on the Commission to calculate the economic costs of transposition delays
I can see the attraction of that idea , but the transposition deficit is a moving target which reflects different directives with different economic impacts over time
However , I have asked my staff to look into the feasibility of making such a calculation and I will report back to you as soon as possible
It is not yet as easy to trade within the internal market as it is to trade within a Member State
We may need to put some disciplines in place to get a change in behaviour
We are also considering ways of making trade in goods easier
EU citizens and businesses deserve more and better information about their internal market rights
Mr Harbour 's report calls for a second Internal Market Forum as a means of connecting with citizens
I welcome the idea of a second forum and I shall be honoured to take part - if you invite me , of course
Remo@@ ving tax obstacles is another key priority
I respect his energy in pursuing that subject
The Commission will bring forward proposals this year to modernise and simplify VAT rules so as to reduce the burden on businesses , particularly on SMEs
This list is not exhaustive
We all know that the internal market covers a multitude of subjects
I should like to work closely with Parliament in the coming months as our strategy takes shape
I will end by endorsing the opening paragraph of the Harbour report which states that the internal market should be the top priority for this year 's Spring Summit
I wholeheartedly agree with Mr Harbour on that and call on Parliament to do everything it can to ensure that this comes about
The Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee broadly shares the view of the state of the internal market set out by the Commission in its third annual report
Like the Commission , we regret that in the period covered by the report only about 50 % of the target actions have been met
However , we reject the Commission 's claim that the Council and Parliament are equally to blame for this failure
The list set out by the Commission itself in the report contains eight examples of where we have failed to meet targets
Six of these clearly lie at the door of the Council , and only two can loo@@ sely be blamed on the European Parliament
As far as the modernisation of markets is concerned , we particularly welcome the call to improve the pace of the delivery of the financial services action plan
Financial services are the oil in Europe 's economic engine , and we share the Commission 's view that a truly integrated financial sector could add between 0
We believe that the Commission has set out a practical roadmap for the next 18 months
The Commission will have the support of my committee , and I am sure the whole of the Parliament , in meeting the objectives it has set out
On Monday , we discussed the fallout from the World Economic Summit in Davos , and today we have already had a debate on the Spring Summit
C@@ ir@@ cling around the future of the internal market and the Lisbon targets , both debates made clear how important the internal market is to us
Yet , despite these manifest advantages , the internal market is not yet complete and still has a large number of weaknesses
1 % of all the directives on the internal market have still not yet been transposed
The Lisbon targets are ambitious , and we will not achieve them without a successful internal market and without adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact
The internal market and the Stability and Growth Pact are the essential instruments for achieving the Lisbon targets by 2010
Their importance lies in the credibility they give to long-term objectives
They have an essential contribution to make in building confidence in Europe 's goals on the part of the public , of enterprises and employees
We demand that coordination of this process be taken charge of by the Commission , and that its right to initiate legislation be extended
This is no longer a matter of apportioning guilt , but of specifying short-term targets - and responsibilities - on the way to the overall objective
This has to do with fiscal policy , with the various competences involved , which still lead to distortions of competition and to new obstacles
It has to do with studying the effects on small and medium-sized enterprises as we progress towards this great internal market
Of course , it also affects the internal market in financial services , which would alone account for 1
1 % - or EUR 130 billion worth - of growth , and it has to do with the creation of the internal services market
So I thank the rapporteur for having made us aware of these things in such an impressive way and also for defining new objectives
Mr President , I should like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur for the work he has done on this report
It is just over ten years now since the internal market came into operation
In that time , vast strides have been made towards the completion of the market
That said , however , there is still a long way to go
There are still a number of barriers - barriers to trade
We look at the different tax regimes in the Member States , whether it be indirect taxation or direct taxation - all are used as barriers to trade
We look at different employment legislation in Member States - this too is used as a barrier to trade
We look at our own failure to decide upon a Community patent - again that is a barrier to trade , but the solution there is in our own hands
However , it is not only the free movement of goods that we should be concerned about
It is also about the free movement of workers , the free movement of labour
At the moment within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market we are discussing the mutual recognition of professional qualifications
The sooner that is sorted out , the sooner another barrier will be removed
In today 's climate , however , there is another barrier
It is a barrier of fear and suspicion which has developed since 11 September , but was probably there beforehand
That is a barrier restricting the free movement of workers
We cannot allow ourselves to become a fortress Europe by setting up internal walls
I was interested to hear what the Commissioner had to say
Most of the time this is for short-term political gain
We have an opportunity to bring about the completion of the internal market
Commissioner , you challenged this Parliament to come up with a hard-@@ hitting report which you have now got
We challenge you to finish the job - and you have our support
Mr President , the report wants Parliament to give its support to the Commission 's Internal Market Strategy , which seeks to homogen@@ ise the various national markets
What concerns the rapporteur is the gap between the intention of completing the unification of the market at European level and the reluctance of the national States
However , what concerns the working classes of the European Union is certainly not that , but rather the avalanche of collective dismis@@ sals
The big companies who are responsible for those dismis@@ sals did not need any vote in the European Parliament to homogen@@ ise their attitude in this area
It is the shareholders who should pay , and not the workers
The profits of the companies and the capital of their shareholders should be used , as a matter of priority , to guarantee the jobs and wages of the workers
I hope the Greek Presidency and the Commission can take up this initiative
Rather , they would receive the comment ' could do better '
In fact , they could do much better
The November scoreboard illustrates our failure to deliver
The Commission should undertake a rigorous evaluation of why Member States are failing to implement , and it must identify the root cause
Is it simply a case of national protectionism ?
Is it due to concern for consumer protection , or to a lack of administrative capacity in Member States ?
I agree that there should be strong sanctions for non-implementation , swift action , tight deadlines and effective deter@@ rents to non-implementation
Otherwise I fear , Commissioner , that we will be here in ten years ' time talking about the need to complete the internal market
Achieving a single market in financial services in one fell swoop could boost EU growth by 1
It would add EUR 130 billion to Europe 's wealth and reduce the cost of raising capital for business by 0
The takeover directive , as I know you agree , Commissioner , is a key component of financial services in single markets
I agree that we in this Parliament should get it onto the statute book as soon as possible
As we say in our country , ' every cand@@ les@@ tick should support its can@@ dle ' and we should not all be judged equally in relation to responsibilities that are different
For those whose political doctrine consists of a social market economy , this involvement by all social elements seems to us to be significant
If on the other hand society is mobilised , this objective will be achieved much more easily
The rapporteur has also accepted my request that greater attention be paid to the existing obstacles to the creation of small businesses and the necessary initiatives to overcome them
And we must ensure that they can be incorporated into the internal market without obstacles , as Mr Karas has said
Mr President , thank you for allowing me to take the floor yet again
I will confine my reply to a few main points
Without the support of Parliament the Commission would be at a loss as to what to do with regard to furthering the internal market
I can assure Mr Harbour that I will speak to my Liberal friends and tell them what they missed tonight
Mr Harbour will recall that the Liberal complement of this Parliament is somewhat smaller than the group to which he himself belongs
Both Mr Harbour and Mr Martin have made references to the European Council
Sometimes the European Council rather ai@@ ri@@ ly asks ministers concerned to deal with that issue and then move on to more ra@@ re@@ fied subjects
Nothing has happened
It is not much use for the European Council to issue gener@@ alities
I wish it would deal more with the subjects at hand
Mr Harbour also mentioned the subject of sales promotion
The Commission will certainly do its best to help the Greek Presidency reach a conclusion on that important file
I shall discuss the matter with those Member States that have outstanding concerns
Mr Martin spoke about a European health card
He may be interested to know that the Commission is engaged in activities in the area of health
The issue concerns citizens who cannot get quick treatment in their own country and so want to go abroad to get treatment
The issue is now whether or not that patient should get authorisation from the authorities in his own country before going abroad for treatment
There was a meeting on that important subject in the so-called ' High Level Ref@@ lection Group ' last week
Therefore it is an aspect of the internal market and one that is very close to the citizen
After all , what is more important to a person than his health ?
Mr Martin may be interested to hear about this
He can rest assured that my colleagues and I are determined to pursue that subject , although some Member States do not agree with this approach
That is an obstacle
Turning to Mr Karas ' point about different tax barriers which exist , again , the Commission is not sitting on its hands
That is a clear case of discrimination against the second Member State
Recently the Commission has started infringement proceedings
Already , in one particular case , the European Court of Justice ruled that this is not admissible
As Members will realise , the area of taxation requires unanimity
To get unanimity among 15 Member States is extremely difficult
To get unanimity in 25 Member States would be well nigh impossible
Regarding Mrs McCarthy 's point on the scoreboard , it is perhaps an unpleasant , but very necessary matter to keep Member States focused on what they have to do
The scoreboard is a form of ' soft law ' , peer pressure or best practice
It is not a legal instrument but it goes together with the matter of infringement proceedings
Therefore we are determined to continue issuing those sco@@ re@@ boards
We must , as Mrs McCarthy said , do our best to do what we decided at Lisbon
Lisbon said that we should have a micro@@ economic structural adjustment programme
There is a delivery gap and we are not doing as well as we ought to
Indeed it is in the Council , most often , where there are obstacles
I tell them with great regularity that they should be quicker
That also applies to the Ta@@ ke@@ over Directive mentioned by Mrs McCarthy and others
Lastly , I entirely agree with Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado that we should see to it that there are no obstacles to the setting-up of small - and medium-sized enterprises
The time needed to set up such a company is much longer than it is in the United States
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
( The sitting was closed at 11
I would first give the floor to Mr Hernández Mollar , Chairman of the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs
In any case , this matter will be dealt with next Monday in our committee 's ordinary session
If no one else wishes to take the floor , we shall vote on this request for urgent procedure
We shall now proceed to the vote on the request for urgent procedure
( The decision was made not to apply urgent procedure
The reported number of deaths related to drug overdose in the European Union is approximately 7 000 per year
De@@ a@@ ths indirectly related to drug use , such as AIDS , traffic accidents , violence or suicide , bring this figure to approximately 20 000 a year
Preven@@ ting the use of illegal drugs is a top priority
This can be achieved by reducing both the supply and the demand for drugs
This proposed recommendation particularly covers the demand side and takes over where law enforcement fails to stop the supply of drugs
Clearly , we should try to persuade people not to use illegal drugs in the first place
The addic@@ ted individual needs to be actively involved in these efforts
This is called risk reduction - or sometimes harm reduction or harm minim@@ isation
This is what the main part of the recommendation is about
The risk reduction methods that feature in the recommendation are well established
They have been used in most or all of the Member States , but to varying degrees
O@@ pi@@ ates , such as heroin , are the root cause of most drug@@ s-related deaths
One of the oldest of the risk reduction methods is controlled use of meth@@ ad@@ one tablets as a substitute for injected heroin
M@@ eth@@ ad@@ one first appeared in the EU in the late 1960s in response to emerging op@@ i@@ ate use
The emergence of HIV in the 1980s led to the introduction of need@@ le - and syr@@ in@@ ge@@ -@@ exchange programmes
In recent years , the number of acute drug@@ s-related deaths at EU level as a whole has stabilised , in spite of increasing drug use
Many factors may have contributed to this development
In@@ jec@@ ting drugs has decreased in some countries and medical treatment of over@@ doses has improved
However , the risk reduction methods covered by this recommendation are likely to have made a large contribution to this favourable development
Drug services need to be easily accessible , reaching out to the place where the drug user happens to be , not where we want him or her to be
These are termed ' ou@@ tre@@ ach services '
Such services should also be offered without unrealistic demands - sometimes called ' low threshold services '
The aim is to prevent further deterioration in the health and social circumstances of users and motivate them to seek treatment
The more controversial risk reduction methods are not mentioned in the present recommendation , although they are being used in some of the Member States
M@@ eth@@ ods such as heroin injec@@ tions under supervision , injection rooms , open-@@ drug scenes and on-the-spot anonymous testing of substances require more research and evaluation before they can be generally recommended
The recommendation emphasises evaluation as a key tool for improving drug@@ s-related measures
It also assists in providing guidelines for the evaluation of drug@@ s-related projects and evaluates different programmes and policies
Madam President , Commissioner , unfortunately , drug abuse is one of today 's major social problems , meaning that the measures and policies applied so far have been inadequate
Drug use is increasing along with the other problems facing modern society
Our proposed amendments mainly specify the action needed at local level if we are to achieve maximum possible results in this difficult and sensitive sector
In other words , when we talk of measures to reduce the harm done by drug use , the main objective is still to cure the user
We can only stop dangerous diseases such as he@@ pati@@ tis , AIDS and tuberculosis from spreading if we educate this group on the health risks
This should also encourage users to be more careful when taking drugs and adopt a healthier lifestyle
It is also vital to include measures targeting high-risk environments , such as prisons
The proportion of in@@ mates in the EU reporting having used drugs varies according to prisons and countries from between 29 and 86 %
Pris@@ on@@ ers are highly exposed to illnesses through the use of common syr@@ inges and need@@ les and sexual contact
Inevitably , the prison staff also face an immediate danger and a number of amendments have been proposed in order to reflect this
Madam President , I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report and the Commissioner for bringing forward this proposal
I think the Commissioner is right at this stage that it should be a recommendation
There are different cultures in different Member States and we need to respect that , and so recommendations on good practice are probably the way forward at this stage
There is no safe drug abuse , it is a question of how we reduce and prevent the harm that arises from such abuse
In my country we have 3 million people on illegal drugs , 28 % of them are 16@@ -@@ 29 year olds , 14 % of them are 14-@@ 15 year olds
We have 12 000 new notified addicts , 70 000 drug offences and 1 200 drug related deaths per year
A@@ cu@@ te drug related deaths have doubled since 1985
However , we must not abandon people who are hoo@@ ked
Many of them , as those figures show , are children
We are losing the battle but we must not give up the fight
This recommendation does exactly that
No Member State is forced to do anything
This sits alongside measures on prevention
It is only if they replace the proposals that I am less happy
This is not the occasion for a debate on legalisation and I know there are some amendments on that
That is why I would reject the legalisation and dec@@ rimin@@ alisation arguments on this occasion
The report does not replace harm reduction with other measures , least of all ' J@@ US@@ T SA@@ Y N@@ O ' , which does not work
I know that from having been Minister responsible for drug addiction in my own country
You have to tell young people in particular the truth
They have to know the upside as well as the downside
We had the case of Le@@ ah B@@ et@@ ts , a young girl who died taking ecstasy , an amp@@ he@@ tamin@@ e
Afterwards , her parents very bravely allowed a video of her body to be shown , so that young people would understand the effect of taking ecstasy
They also joined us in making sure that we issued guidance to night clubs on how to avoid this catastrophe affecting other people
There are so many young people who need and deserve our support
There are need@@ le exchanges , which protect not just the addicts , but also the people with whom they are in contact
I welcome this report
I give the floor to Mrs Sand@@ ber@@ g-@@ F@@ ries , whom I would take the opportunity to welcome back to the European Parliament
Madam President , this report concerns the prevention and reduction of risks associated with drug dependence
From the beginning , we Swedish Social Democrats have held the view that the recommendation focuses to an unduly high degree upon harm reduction
Our point of departure is that the most important measure for reducing harm is that of preventing dependence itself
That does not mean that we deny the need for efforts to reduce harm
Such efforts must , however , form part of a coherent strategy aimed at bringing about lasting change and lives not dependent upon illegal and other drugs
On this point , the committee has complied with quite a few of the proposals we have tabled
It is therefore very odd that the same committee in the same report should also have accepted a number of amendments in quite the opposite vein
I mean the proposals concerning so-called ch@@ ill-@@ out rooms , drug classification , special injecting rooms and positive information about drugs
These are proposals that we cannot under any circumstances support
Such measures would imply social acceptance of drug abuse
Nor , obviously , do we accept proposals that are basically contrary to the UN Convention on Drugs
This survey shows that 92 out of every 100 pupils in Swedish schools have not even tried drugs
This is a result that , in an international context , is extremely encouraging
Dru@@ g@@ -related deaths are on the up , and that seems to be the case in most of the Member States
For all these reasons , the Liberal Group welcomes the amendments that add value to this recommendation in terms of public health
Our governments must indeed give priority to high-risk environments
Stre@@ ets , the penal system , night@@ clubs , ra@@ ves , are all places where hard drugs circulate freely and without regard to the minimum standards of health and safety
I wish to say that I go along with Mr Bowis ' arguments and that I am unable to accept those put forward by Mrs Sand@@ ber@@ g-@@ F@@ ries
Every Member will express his or her opinion in this Chamber on how risks are to be prevented and reduced
Mrs Mal@@ li@@ ori 's report clearly refers to reducing supply and demand , to integrated policies , to the exchange of good practice and to a concern for social re-@@ integration
These are the bases of the report
I know that , on this subject , there are differences , including in my own group , where my Swedish fellow MEPs do not share this position of mine
An assessment will be carried out in due course
One hundred and thirty people chron@@ ically addic@@ ted to the drug have been selected to see if the programme produces results
I , for my part , Commissioner , think that this programme is very worthwhile because it may help us all in the future
I shall conclude by pointing out that the report also deals with the situation in prisons
Madam President , a report like this , on how to deal with drug abuse , will always be controversial in this House
This is because it touches on our inability to control reality , and that is difficult for us as politicians
I therefore think that it is courageous and commendable that the rapporteur has managed to keep both feet on the ground
' In an ideal world there would be no drug abuse
In the real world , drugs have always been a fact of life
' and that is the way things are
Zero tolerance or simpler still , closing your eyes , is not a solution
The question to our politicians is therefore how can we bring about an improvement to a reality that we do not like
One such possibility is described in Amendment No 24 , which encourages Member States to facilitate the testing of synthetic drugs
These are drugs that are mainly used by young people at disco@@ s , concer@@ ts and parties
I am in fact talking about ecstasy , the consequences of which have also just been set out by Mr Bowis
Testing can reduce the health risks
It puts social workers in touch with users , and it also helps assess the dangerous substances that are available on the market
Testing can take place in testing centres throughout the country or in situ at parties or concer@@ ts
Drug abuse is also a threat to young people
It is well known that there are differences between different kinds of drugs
In@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous drug use inevitably results in social exclusion , as it soon excludes the essential elements of normal life - work , family , personal relationships and a permanent home
That is not to say , however , that there is nothing wrong with other drugs
It was wrongly stated in the discussions that so-called soft drugs are harmless
It is partly on account of this belief that the use of cannabis has increased enormously
It has furthermore been scientifically proven that there is a relationship between the use of these drugs and mental health
For example , the chance of developing schizophrenia is 30 % to 50 % higher for cannabis users
I am quoting the British Medical Journal of 23 November 2002
What is more , the policy of tolerance of soft drugs - as in the Netherlands - has resulted in an increase in use , particularly among young people
In practice the switch to hard drugs has also been shown to be much easi@@ er; after all , the use of drugs is already accepted
The recommendation before us is about the health risks associated with drug addiction
The European Commission mainly places the emphasis on limiting the risks instead of prevention
The rapporteur is arguing for additional measures , particularly for the care of drug users at local level , for example by helping drug users achieve a healthier life
The rapporteur cites the provision of a number of elementary health services such as clean hypo@@ der@@ m@@ ic syr@@ inges and blood tests
This may perhaps go a little way towards achieving better hygiene , but does not contribute to solving the problems
I am firmly convinced that kicking the habit is the best way of achieving a healthier life
The negative effect of a liberal drugs policy has the effect of drawing people into certain other areas
Crime , decay and the lack of safety in certain parts of towns and cities have taken on serious proportions
To dismiss these arguments with the argument that this recommendation is only about the effects on health is misplaced
The effects on health can best be reduced by means of a restrictive policy
In addition , I am also in favour of proper help for addicts
We do not help drug addicts by only treating symptoms
If we want to get drug addicts out of the downward spiral , kicking the habit - either voluntarily or otherwise - is the best option
In the Netherlands there are fortunately examples of so-called hopeless cases who , with the right motivation , have been helped to achieve a drug@@ -free existence
This approach does most to benefit health
I cannot accept Mr Bowis ' suggestion for Amendments Nos 60 , 61 and 64 to be regarded as additional ones
Madam President , Commissioner , it is a matter of concern that the use of drugs is everywhere being treated as unimportant and commonplace
This phenomenon goes hand in hand with the social acceptance of the marketing of them for recreational purposes , sometimes on a daily basis
Drugs are not , though , an accident of fate to which one must resign oneself
They involve serious risk of infection and lead to people being socially excluded in a very real sense
You have to call a spade a spade
This report speaks of risks , for the danger is indeed there
How do you combat evil if you start from the premise that it is inevitable or even necessary ?
To do so demonstrates a sad det@@ ach@@ ment from reality
The risk will be no less if we sink into politically correct indifference
Drug addiction is not tolerable
It is a scourge that must be fought against
There are no soft drugs
There certainly needs to be information , but the trivi@@ alisation of drug use is a sn@@ are and must be combated
As for a policy of risk-@@ reduction , it could not do other than appear like fat@@ alistic acceptance of the dangers
I therefore welcome this proposal for a recommendation and the excellent report by Mrs Mal@@ li@@ ori
Faced with such problems , it is impossible to be absolutely sure of what approach to take
We must , however , move in a new direction
Our second priority is to develop a risk-@@ reduction policy
For those infected for whom free drug treatments have not achieved positive results , meth@@ ad@@ one substitution programmes must be pursued
We must also be able to undertake an evaluation of these results
Madam President , drug addiction is a complicated problem with significant social consequences for the user and for his or her environment , with risks to health and ongoing crime
There are , however , not only social consequences , but also social causes
Our rapporteur , Min@@ er@@ va Mal@@ li@@ ori , deserves our firm support for her approach
A tailor-made appro@@ ach@@ ; as drug users are not all the same , the prevention of drug use and drug addiction must be based on respect for the drug user
There has been a great deal of disagreement over the years about the approach to the drugs problem , all of which involve firm stances
The Commission has opted for a policy of risk reduction or damage limitation
Righ@@ tly so , as risk reduction can limit the impact on health
A policy of monitoring substances and clean hypo@@ der@@ m@@ ic syr@@ inges can save lives
Naturally risk reduction must not lead to complacency , however
We cannot relax about the addiction problem
Conversely , the policy of damage limitation is precisely what makes a convincing approach to drugs crime possible
There thus does not need to be a huge contrast between the policy of damage limitation and the policy of drug prevention
We should be receptive to the benefits of each approach
Mrs Mal@@ li@@ ori 's local approach can achieve a great deal , and the establishment of mobile low threshold help services is a good idea
We do not , however , have to strive towards a uniform approach , although we must be willing to learn from one another
We must compare the approaches to see which is effective in countering addiction
This report is a good opportunity for us to familiarise ourselves with the approach in various countries
I warmly invite my fellow Members to come and see how it is done in the Netherlands
Madam President , hundreds of thousands of people die each year from the use of perfectly legal drugs
Yet we subsidise the growing of tobacco plants while we cut down cannabis plants
It is all complete nonsense
The truth is that prohibition lies at the very heart of many of our problems
Pro@@ hibi@@ tion creates huge profits for criminals , who seek to extend their market
Pro@@ hibi@@ tion denies drug users the information about content that is available to everyone who enjoys an alcohol drink in the evening
If health messages are to work and society is to be protected we must replace prohibition with government regulation
The criminals must be denied their profits if we are to bring these problems under control
This paper is an excellent step forward
It ignores the moral outrage which has been expressed so often in the past
It concentrates on pragmatic and sensible steps to inform people and reduce harm
It is in complete contrast to the Swedish approach , which I find utterly appalling
As Mr Bowis said , just saying ' no ' does not work - it certainly does not work in most of the societies in which we live
The idea that we should try and prevent need@@ le exchanges , for example , will simply mean more deaths , more blood poisoning , more AIDS
It is a vicious and cruel approach
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the Italian Radicals do not support this report either
This is why , together with other Members and the International Anti@@ prohibitionist League , we have launched a large-scale campaign condemning the UN Conventions
Madam President , when we talk about drugs , we clearly mean out@@ -and-@@ out war
We cannot just be content with a few short battles
It must be pointed out that we need to start by addressing a human condition , the condition of drug addicts
We do not endorse the use of substances such as meth@@ ad@@ one , except in extreme clinical cases
In addition to medical and pharmaceutical care , we need to provide drug addicts with psychological help too
First and foremost , we need to step up the fight against the network of traffickers who continue , I regret to say , to be on the scene
these kinds of approach must be abandoned
They are amendments which relate , above all , to prevention
Amendment No 60 proposes some ideas for freeing addicts from their dependence , striking at the root of the evil
Amendment No 61 relates to treatments which are not based on drugs but which include a great deal of psychological help for the ill drug addic@@ t
Amendment No 62 recommends great caution in providing access to need@@ les , condoms and syr@@ inges
Amendments Nos 63 and 64 are on the subject of preventive and preparatory measures , first and foremost , for the people responsible for implementing these measures
Madam President , I am deeply concerned , Commissioner
Listening to our fellow MEP , Mr Davies is extremely depressing
More and more young people in Europe are ending up in the type of s@@ qual@@ or brought about by drugs
The trend is in the wrong direction
Mr Davies thinks so too , but more and more EU countries appear to have given up
In this Chamber too , voices in favour of legalising and liberalising drugs and classifying them as dangerous and less dangerous are being heard more and more often
Here in Parliament , there is a desire to tear up the UN conventions on drugs
These are what we have to hold onto , Commissioner
I am afraid that European drugs policy is on the decline
That being said , it is quite unreasonable to begin talking about the ' upside ' of drugs and about ch@@ ill-@@ out rooms and injecting rooms
Drug policy must free addicts from dependence , not san@@ iti@@ se dependence
The only way to achieve that goal is through a combination of bans , care , preventive work and international cooperation
The objective , which has to remain in place , must be a drug@@ s-@@ free society
We Swedish Liberals will vote against the report because it lacks this overall combination
At this moment nobody in my country knows what is actually legally permitted and what is not legally or socially permitted , with all the extremely serious consequences this entails
Young people and children in my country currently do not know where they stand
I regret the fact that the present recommendations do not contain these two necessary components , and so I am unfortunately not able approve the report
Madam President , Mrs Mal@@ li@@ ori 's report is mainly acceptable in itself
The main basis of the report is health grounds , but its general tone could be interpreted as permissive with respect to drugs
It does Mrs Mal@@ li@@ ori 's report credit that it should mention that problems with alcohol are on a par with drug problems
This is the way we should be going
The EU must agree to raise taxes on alcohol , hence reducing consumption and the harm it does
Social welfare and healthcare costs will then come down , so allowing us to cut other forms of taxation
The Member States must also be able to maintain a protection from imports system that would make possible a national , health-@@ promoting policy on alcohol
Madam President , initially we denied that the problem existed
Then gradually we moved from denying that the problem existed to playing down its import@@ an@@ ce; it varied depending on the country and the society concerned
I think that this report now presents us with a more holistic approach
I find the report positive overall , although it could certainly be improved
The analysis is very comprehensive and good
Because if we are not in a position to share of our own free will now , then we will certainly have to do so in the future
Although this is not directly our responsibility , I do believe - indeed I am convinced - that this issue needs to be raised
Consum@@ ption is generally presented as an individual problem
The consequences , as it states in detail in the analysis contained in the report , are also a public health problem
Let me first make it clear that prevention will always be our priority
The scope of the recommendation is , however , focused on risk reduction
This is not an alternative , but an important other element in the fight against drugs
Most of the suggested amendments strengthen the recommendation
I am pleased to say that the Commission agrees with 41 out of the 66 proposed amendments
A number of those amendments overlap and redrafting may be necessary for other reasons
Those involving financial commitments should be dealt with according to normal procedures
I particularly welcome Amendments 12 and 24 suggesting the addition of risk reduction methods related to the use of new synthetic drugs such as ecstasy
Stric@@ tly speaking , this might be regarded as on the periphery of the scope of this recommendation , as most users of these drugs are not actually addic@@ ted
But the use of these drugs is on the increase
Some users show a compul@@ sive use pattern and they are frequently part of a network where drug use is very common
As I have said , many of the suggested amendments can be supported , but time does not allow me to mention all of them
I have arranged for a list to be handed over to Parliament 's secretariat for inclusion in the Minutes of this debate for greater clarity and precision
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at midday
Madam President , I wish to thank everyone who has contributed to this debate
Throughout this process there has been a lot of consensus and , for a change , most colleagues agree that action needs to be taken
That is why I accept all three amendments which have been tabled to this report
How did we get to this stage ?
Over eight years ago a woman called Margot Cam@@ er@@ on attended a sur@@ gery held by my colleague , Mr Miller
She said that nobody would listen to her
Her story so inspired my colleague that a petition was lodged with the European Parliament which showed that Margot was not alone
There are many Mar@@ go@@ ts in the UK and across the EU with similar stories concerning problems with silicone
The petition has led to the Commission reclassi@@ fying breast implants as a C@@ lass III product under the Medical Dev@@ ices Directive 93/@@ 4@@ 2/@@ EEC
Member States are to adopt and publish laws , regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this directive no later than 1 August 2003
If I am not mistaken , this is the first time that such a petition has led to direct action by the Commission
I hope that more and more EU citizens will find solutions to their problems through this route
However , much as Parliament welcomes the Commission 's actions , we would like to take this matter still further
My report aims to answer both the legitimate concerns of thousands of women and the need to put patient safety first
Therefore , the report recommends Member States to take measures to increase and improve information for patients through tracking and surveillance , quality control and assurance
In this perspective , I particularly want to emphasise three main points
This includes all forms of direct advertising , such as in magazines and the use of ' before and after ' pictures
We must clamp down on this misleading advertising that is fuelling demand and which many women pin so much hope on
Perhaps ' before and after ' photographs of women who have suffered from rup@@ tured implants would tell a very different side of the story to the read@@ ers of glos@@ sy magazines
I would like to see the 18@@ -year age limit applied - apart from where there is medical need - in order to protect young women from making ill-@@ informed beauty choices
Secondly , the need for information requires proper labelling and marketing , including health warnings explaining the health risks involved
For instance , women should be aware that breast implants will have to be replaced after a time period
It is a grave state of affairs that for too long cosmetic cow@@ boys have got away with not explaining these simple facts
It is for this reason that we require the creation of an international register of accredited plastic surgeons
Finally , there must be responsible research
Before breast implants are placed on the market , manufacturers must collect clinical data on the characteristics and performance of their product
It also means that bre@@ ast-@@ im@@ plant producers need to trace their products
Therefore , the creation of a national breast im@@ plant registration to keep women informed in the event of a product fault is vital
This issue will not go away
The same applies to the members of the Committees on Petitions and Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities who also played a part in the process
The report reflects the policy consensus between the European Parliament and the Commission
I am pleased to inform Parliament that , last week , the Commission adopted a directive reclassi@@ fying breast implants in the context of the legislation on medical devices
B@@ reast implants are now subject to the most stringent assessment procedures
More precisely , breast implants have been reclassi@@ fied from class I@@ I@@ B to class III
It requires , in addition , clinical data and design attribu@@ tes , namely on bio@@ compatibility , physical and mechanical properties
This will increase the level of safety of breast implants
The Commission received encouraging information from Member States regarding national measures taken , or further developed , under the recommendations set out in our communication of November 2001
This paper will be finalised in the coming weeks
The Commission believes that its communication and the production of the forthcoming working document have produced a significant effect
All Member States have acted by verifying existing national policies and by starting to introduce measures as recommended by the communication
Both documents will continue to be a useful element that interest groups and national authorities may use , at national level , to promote best practice and inspire further actions
The excellent cooperation between Parliament and the Commission on this subject should be highlighted , since the overall result has been extremely positive
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , thousands of women have peti@@ tioned Parliament to take a stand on the dangers inherent in the use of silicone breast implants
B@@ reast implants are subject to the standard quality and safety requirements for medical devices , being covered - as you also mentioned , Commissioner - by Directive 93/@@ 4@@ 2/@@ EEC
It was lobbying from self-@@ help groups of women suffering adverse effects from sili@@ con@@ -@@ gel breast implants that prompted the Commission Communication
Si@@ lic@@ on implants were used for years before there was regulation or surveillance of their use
Public health and healthcare issues are for the most part the competence of the Member States
Pers@@ onal privacy must be protected
Access to the registers will therefore have to be restricted and their contents treated as confidential
B@@ est practice will have to be publicised and then applied Europe-wide
We need research and further development work to be carried out on safety and im@@ plant toler@@ ation
Here the introduction of a passport for im@@ plant recipients and compulsory after@@ care examinations might also be helpful for gathering data
Ac@@ cur@@ ate information must not be given in the form of advertising
Advertising will increase demand for implants
What is needed , however , is balanced information
I should like to thank Mrs Stihler for her balanced report
Ladies and gentlemen , in my view , breast implants are also an integral part of health
They are needed to reconstruct bre@@ asts
A@@ esthetic reasons do often play a role , but if someone thinks that they are inferior then it is their general health that suffers
With the help of implants their sense of well-being can be restored
The Committee on Petitions , with its ear open to the public , reacted at that time by asking STOA to carry out an independent and intensive study of implants
Although some may object that this is just one more piece of paper , I consider it an effective way to replen@@ ish the future European database
Moreover , such a system would , above all , allow the patient to have real knowledge of the im@@ plant 's specific characteristics
It is also a way in which we can show the petitioners that we do indeed honour our commitments
She sends her apologies
B@@ reast implants are covered by the directive on medical devices
Broadly speaking , the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats can support the Commission Communication and the report tabled by Mrs Stihler
every year 160 000 women in the European Union suffer from breast cancer
It affects one in eight women
In Germany alone , that means over 50 000 women every year
Parliament is acutely aware of how topical and sensitive this issue is
In the post-@@ operative care of breast cancer patients , breast implants are often a decisive factor in increasing their quality of life
Where breast ab@@ normalities and sur@@ g@@ ical beauty treatments are concerned , the options available must also be explained and safety guaranteed
We are therefore calling for a number of decisive measures to be taken , above and beyond the Commission 's proposals
It is essential for a minimum age to be set for cosmetic breast operations
These should not be carried out on young women under the age of 18
Oper@@ ations for medical reasons would be exempt
In addition , advertising for such implants that is directed at the general public should be banned along the lines of the French model
It would then only be permitted to publish objective information in a non-commercial context
It must be guaranteed that advice and information will be provided prior to the operation by a doctor specialising in plastic sur@@ gery
As in other areas , more emphasis needs to be given to providing patients with information
Before the operation date is agreed , the women concerned should therefore also be given an information sheet
It is important for this to be based on the content already developed by E@@ Q@@ U@@ A@@ M
It should contain both a warning about the potential health risks and also a clear appeal only to agree an operation date once all remaining questions are fully resolved
This is also the point made in the amendment that I have tabled to paragraph 9 of the report
Where si@@ lic@@ on implants are concerned , we need high standards of safety and quality at international level
For this reason , we need cross-border registration of breast implants to be made compulsory at international level
In this context , the EU Member States should be advised to become members of the international breast im@@ plant register
The scientific research carried out over the last few years has yielded some decisive findings in this field
We therefore also think it is important to support this research and guarantee that the scientific work continues across Europe
Overall the Commission Communication , together with the amendments proposed by Parliament , constitutes an important step in the right direction
It is not a question of making it more difficult to use breast implants , for either medical or cosmetic reasons
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too should like to thank Mrs Stihler very much for her excellent and , above all , important report
Time and again , women complain about the damage suffered to their health following the use of breast implants or about operations that have had undesirable cosmetic results
Incidentally , 80 % of breast im@@ plant operations are carried out for purely cosmetic reasons
The constant physical and emotional suffering caused by the im@@ plant operations is often immense
As a rule this ought to be avoidable , as the cause is not the implants per se
This has been confirmed in studies , and particularly impressively by the STOA study from the year 2000
I am thinking of the recent decision to reclassi@@ fy breast implants as class 3 medical devices
The passport should be signed by the doctor and the patient before the operation as a clear declaration of consent
I am thinking , for example , of heart sur@@ gery , the requirements imposed on which by the Commission are sufficiently restrictive
The Liberals therefore give their active support to Amendment No 2 tabled by the Group of the Party of European Socialists
This gave rise to the STOA report , according to which there was apparently no evidence of a relationship between silicone implants and , for example , cancer
There was , however , a clear indication of the various kinds of inconvenience caused to women who wanted , or felt obliged , to undergo im@@ plant operations
The problem became public knowledge because one of the women who had been given implants had to have both her bre@@ asts removed
Mr President , I should like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on an excellent report
One of the key issues is the ban on the direct advertising of breast implants to the public
The provision of non-commercial information through national public health services is the way forward
France has already introduced a ban
All Member States should do the same in relation to breast implants because they always involve certain risks
The promotion of cosmetic sur@@ gery in general is a major problem
Action should be taken to prevent situations whereby women and indeed men are coerced into unnecessary sur@@ gery which may involve particular risks
It is true that there are , in many cases , health and psychological reasons for breast implants , but we need to be careful in that regard
I agree with the rapporteur concerning the age limit
Im@@ plants in women under the age of 18 should be authorised only on medical grounds
Anyone under 18 years of age is extremely vulnerable and could be coerced into something they may regret in later years
Advertising for cosmetic sur@@ gery should carry clear health warnings
This applies not only to women but also to men
The advertising industry has a huge amount to answer for
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate Mrs Stihler on her report
As an on@@ co@@ logical surgeon and university research scientist , I read the report very carefully and support many of the proposals it contains
I feel , however , that the tone is excessively alarmist and I will tell you why
In 1986 , the University of L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es examined 3000 women who had had implants for at least six years and found no risk of increasing ne@@ op@@ la@@ sia or to mobility
In 1992 , the University of Cal@@ g@@ ary , examining 11 000 women , reached the same conclusions
The American Association of R@@ he@@ um@@ ato@@ logists also promoted two studies on the risk of auto@@ immune path@@ ology in women with silicone implants , which recorded good tolerance in all cases
It was discovered that the average life of implants is between 15 and 25 years and spontaneous rup@@ ture is often as@@ ym@@ p@@ tom@@ atic
There are therefore no sufficiently serious grounds for preventing the use of implants , except in young women less than 18 years old
As regards paragraph 10@@ a , I would like to point out that patient consent forms are already in use in all the States of the Union
It is compulsory for the patient to sign a form after receiving all the necessary information , before any treatment is applied , including implants
I therefore feel it superfluous to mention a passport
I also feel it would be useful to set up European and national registers containing data collected on both a@@ esthetic and therapeutic breast implants
It is for good reason that it is mainly women who are speaking here
The question came from grass roots level and on this basis we have already spent a long time working on creating a good Community framework
I hope that he will also work hard on following up what we recommend today
Without wanting to repeat what has already been said , I would just briefly like to ask what is particularly important , and what our starting points are
Our main aim is to see patients protected
We do not want a ban@@ ; a woman must be able to decide for herself in good faith whether she wants breast implants or not
What we do want is to ensure that she is properly informed and that she knows what the disadvantages and potential dangers of a breast im@@ plant are
That is why we have such a problem with advertising
This is not the same as selling a coffee mach@@ ine@@ ; this is about a medical intervention
We do not want women to be persuaded to change their bre@@ asts on the basis of misleading advertising
Why is compulsory registration so important ?
That is why proper registration is essential
Finally , protecting the patient
Yes , protecting young people , yes , making sure that they are given time to think things over
In cases in which they cannot be restored , they at least want to make sure that the external damage caused is made as invisible as possible
This naturally also applies to women who have had an operation as a result of breast cancer
They thought it was a good solution to replace the lost part of their bodies with an artificial substitute that has the same sup@@ plen@@ ess as the original living material
These days there are disappointed women who find that they have been poisoned after such treatment
These are the people who are warning against this happening again and are pleading for a ban
The new material generally lasts only a few years; after that the silicone may leak or escape into the body
Those affected by this may have been beautiful for a short time but are ill for a long time afterwards
A positive point in the rapporteur 's proposal is to prohibit advertising for this solution and to improve advice on the negative consequences and on alternatives
It may be possible to live with silicone bre@@ asts if they are periodically replaced with new material
I agree with Mrs McKenna that if it is not possible to severely restrict these practices , a ban may soon be unavoidable
Mr President , I also wish to thank the Commission for this proposal and to congratulate Mrs Stihler on an excellent report on a very important subject
It is an area that touches upon many aspects of health and consumer policy
Thousands of women who have had problems have contacted the European Parliament and want us to express an opinion on the dangers associated with silicone breast implants
This shows that those who carry out these operations are not always reliable and that there is an extreme lack of information
The weekly magazines fuel this trend by showing ' before and after ' pictures
It is therefore high time that , as responsible politicians , we protected patients by beginning to bring some order to this very confused area
I completely agree with Mrs Stihler that this is only a step in that direction
I believe that many more binding commitments are required on the part of those who carry out these implants
The proposal that surgeons and clinics must issue guarantees is also important
Unlike my colleagues , I think that registration at both national and EU levels is justified
When there is insufficient research , a register is needed
I am very satisfied with the report
We , the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , fully support the report and the amendments tabled
Mr President , I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur and all colleagues who have worked on this report for keeping this issue in the spotlight
The rapporteur told you a story about a woman called Margot Cam@@ er@@ on who came to see me eight years ago
She wan@@ dered in , nobody would listen to her , and we sat down and looked at the problem she had and started campaigning
It is a success story , because here we are today looking at legislation that we are putting through this Parliament , which is great
I would like to tell you another story , which does not have such a happy ending
As I have said , this all happened eight years ago when Margot Cam@@ er@@ on came to see me
We started campaigning and raised the issue at national level and finally took it to European level
I remember going to that Committee and arguing , along with the women , for that petition
' sorry gu@@ v , nothing to do with us - it is a Member State issue '
That delay set us back years
It was 2001 before we got any satisfaction out of the Commission
In that period 28 000 further operations were carried out in the UK alone
It is estimated that 20 000 of those implants have either leaked or rup@@ tured during that period
What happened as a result of that delay ?
We let down not only the women who had signed that petition , but also a lot of women who had gone down the road of getting implants
This shows that we have to address these issues and problems more speedily when they arise and not let women suffer in the way they have in the past
Many Member States have banned tril@@ uc@@ ent implants and have banned sal@@ ine implants
We have got to look in the future at a ban on silicone implants
Because they affect people 's health
If it were men getting the implants , there would be a ban tomorrow , but that is not happening because men are not getting them
I would like to make one final point
I think it is a real scandal that people like my colleague Mrs Van Brempt have had to take reproaches from those who are earning big money from this
A number take the plunge and have recourse to cosmetic sur@@ gery
For others , such sur@@ gery takes on a re@@ constructive role and helps them heal their wounds and rebuild their bodies
In the former case , however , it is material external to themselves that their bodies are having to incorporate
I would note , for my part , a number of areas on which our activity must be focused
Although silicone implants are highly dispar@@ aged and have been subject to many studies , silicone is not the only component of the pros@@ theses
It is also important that they be warned of the risks , the costs , the advantages and the disadvantages connected with the insertion and wearing of breast implants
Mr President , firstly I would like to thank Ms Stihler for drawing up this report and indeed the Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Protection
I first came into contact with this as a political issue in the Committee on Petitions when the long and hard work done by Mr Miller came before us
We finally got some movement from the Commission on the matter
I therefore welcome the announcement today by the Commissioner that implants have been reclassi@@ fied as medical devices , and the effects that will have on how they may be controlled
B@@ reast im@@ plant advertising specifically - indeed im@@ plant advertising of any kind - should be regulated
It is not acceptable that these implants should be advertised as simple and straightforward , with no indication that there are medical risks involved
There are question marks relating to si@@ lic@@ on implants which have not been answered by studies to date , and I would urge further research on that
I do not think it is necessary to draw attention to the gender of Members who speak on issues in this Parliament
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken at noon
( The sitting was suspended at 11
and resumed at noon )
I would ask for this change to be made , noted and taken into account
We must vote against this amendment , or else our own amendment will fail
I do not understand why the majority has rejected the second part of Amendment No 49 , but this is in fact what they have done
Mr Ribeiro e Castro , the competent services will look into it
However , the House has voted and we cannot go back on that vote
Single market though there may have been since 1986 , no actual common market has been achieved
Enlargement to include ten new countries will take us further away from that objective , and the 2013 deadline will be put back again
Given the number and significance of the details , there are ever more conflicts of interpretation and procedures to deal with violations
The strategy must be to reduce such conflicts , not to resolve them by legal force
Con@@ fron@@ ted by the economic and social realities , all that matters is the will and the capacity to apply the wordings
With the standardisation of health services as its objective , the report explains that a safeguard clause might undermine uniformity
We are , in practice , opposed to this report
These factors have undermined internal demand and increase risks of def@@ lation in the Euro@@ zone , particularly in Germany
I abstained from voting on this report on the Commission report on the Internal Market Strategy
A fully operational internal market for goods and services is an integral part of the Lisbon objectives for economic reform
Furthermore , the rapporteur even claims that the use of safeguard clauses by Member States is likely to damage the uniformity of Community legislation
Member States ' sovereignty must be respected when considering the need to establish or improve safeguard mechanisms in certain areas of their economies
Otherwise , things will be totally regulated by the Community , which would damage the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality
We are opposed to the F@@ orest F@@ oc@@ us regulation , as we are to the Redondo report , and for the following reasons
Secondly , the change of legal basis causes us concern
Fore@@ sts will no longer come under the heading of agriculture but will become a new component of environmental policy
Are we heading towards a C@@ EP - Common Environmental Policy - in order better to destroy the CAP ?
Prac@@ tically every gro@@ ve of trees would fall within the scope of the regulation
This is of considerable importance to Portugal which , having the highest density of forest in Europe , is every year the victim of the scourge of forest fires
It is extremely disturbing that 1 % of Mediterranean forest is lost every year as a result of fires
We must adopt fire prevention action , bearing in mind especially that these must be in
I want to see the fight taken to poverty and the prevention of appalling human and social situations
Nevertheless , I deplore the fact that the majority should have prevented a consensus from being achieved and rejected special provisions for mothers in difficulty
I regret the fact that there was an insistence on not clarifying the language used and that confusion could allow international sponsorship of abortion policies with European Union funds
The speeches given in plenary yesterday by supporters of the report and by opponents of my amendments speak for themselves
That concludes voting time
( The sitting was suspended at 12
and resumed at 3 p
In the context of aid to the poorest countries , the US cannot impose a development model by implementing measures related to sexual and reproductive health rights
I am referring specifically to sterilisation and abortion
The content of this report is ambivalent and could lead to abuses as a result of its implicit promotion of abortion
Any options or measures decided on in this field , in the context of health , can only be determined by States in accordance with their national laws
We can only vote in favour of a report that safeguards the incontrovertible principle of the right to life and of respect for the sovereignty of States
This resolution proposes to create a new budget to be used for combating mortality during pregnancy and child@@ birth in the poor countries of the world
We have supported this initiative in spite of its limitations
Indeed , this new budget item is not accompanied by new funding
The necessary money would be taken from the existing budget
The European Parliament has , in fact , succeeded in resisting the reactionary pressure exercised by the fundamentalist Right
Once such a measure is provided for , it becomes legitimate , whereas stances on this subject are very diverse and , above all , irreconcilable
It is in fact very clear to me that one of the results of development is a lasting improvement in the health and well-being of populations
Each year , a third of pregnancies are in fact unwanted or un@@ planned
This situation leads women to have recourse to abortions carried out in dangerous conditions , and it causes as many as 78 000 deaths each year
It is a good thing that the European Union should help the developing countries take care of their populations ' health
Aid does not , however , mean imposing our European models on countries with different cultures and traditions
It is morally unacceptable to make our aid conditional upon denying nations ' identity and upon their having to adopt our conception of family planning
Moreover , setting abortion up as a new method of contraception is out of the question
That , however , is what this report is leading up to , even if Mrs Sand@@ ba@@ ek says it is not
Abortion is a crime that kills the child and destroys the mother
By offering women abortion as their only option , rather than helping them , a further trauma is added to their difficulties
That is how it will be possible to provide them with the psychological and material aid that they need
That is also why I shall vote against this report which , far from helping populations in difficulty , will succeed only in adding to their feelings of helplessness
We have acknowledged the right which all people have to care and services , and to choose how many children to have and when to have them
We have voted to renew and increase funding to EUR 74
We rejected new amendments designed to distort the focus and substance of the Regulation
My colleague 's , Mrs Sand@@ ba@@ ek 's , report has given rise to much debate and triggered some passionate feeling
The report contains only sensible amendments , however
In many developing countries , women fight for their reproductive rights and for control of their sexuality
A number of colleagues have , however , chosen to deny women these basic rights by proposing another route , that of supporting them in choosing to have their babies
This is a covert way of denying women 's inalienable right to abortion
For all these reasons , I have , in all conscience , supported Mrs Sand@@ ba@@ ek 's report
Because Amendment No 53 was not carried I cannot support this important compulsory regulation in the area of development aid
We Moder@@ ates believe that drug dependence needs to be combated vigorously
Politicians and authorities must therefore emphasise clearly that every form of drug dependence is unacceptable
We do not accept measures proposed in the report that may make it easier to use certain drugs
So-called harm reduction is in danger of becoming a gateway to drug dependence on the part of young people , rather than a safety measure
We are also against syr@@ inge exchange programmes , because they may be interpreted in terms of authorities ' and care institutions ' consent to the misuse of injec@@ tions
The report does not comply with the guidelines in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity
It is the Member States whose task it is themselves to develop forms of treatment within the health care services that deal with addiction
We Moder@@ ates are therefore voting against the above report
This good report , which is going in the right direction , towards realism rather than a reactionary ideology , has been widely approved
That is a good thing
That is why I also voted in favour of the report
During the 1990s , the use of cannabis considerably increased in most EU countries
However , users of hard drugs by injection are a more elusive group that is therefore bound to be condemned to social exclusion , as the report indicates
First of all , it is now essential that we advocate prevention through information channels
We need to inform over and over again in order to prevent current standards from becoming blurred in the eyes of the young people of Europe
That is why we should welcome the recommendation inviting local groups to help drug addicts to opt for a healthier life
The report is broadly to be welcomed , and so we voted in favour of it
It is a good thing that MEPs are at last receptive to the way we treat drug addicts in the Netherlands
The Netherlands has been treated as a pariah for years , but now we are being praised for the way we are dealing with these matters
The results of this vote are an endorsement of Dutch drugs policy
I am pleased with the members ' decision to call on Member States in this report to place prevention and risk limitation at centre stage in our drugs policy
In this context , we should be offering facilities to help drug addicts kick their habit
We should also be making better use of the experiences of former drug users in the information we provide in places like schools and community centres
By providing better information we should be able to give young people a better idea of the consequences of taking drugs
We will have to pay specific attention to prisoners
I believe that it is a good thing for Member States to get prisons completely free from drugs
I have therefore voted in favour of this proposal
Both points of view get in the way of proper information and the achievement of good health
In this regard we can learn from the struggle against alcohol and tobacco addiction
I support the Mal@@ li@@ ori report with some minor exceptions
I abstained from voting on this report
The rapporteur could have gone further in combating the ambivalent discourse on the use of drugs
So common amongst some parts of the European Left , which refuses to see drug consumption as the breaking of each citizen 's responsibility towards their fellow citizens
The truth is that , unfortunately , mistaken policies always result in human disasters on the ground
I have voted against the report , which was approved by 3@@ 75 votes , with 46 against and 35 abstentions
The term ' risk reduction ' is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the UN conventions on drugs
It is therefore deeply regrettable that , in four of its twelve recommendations under item 2 , the Council specifically proposes ' risk reduction ' as a method
In other words , the Council recommendation represents a capitulation on the issue of fully rehabil@@ itating and curing drug addicts
The rapporteur emphasises the presence of drugs in institutions and proposes that dis@@ infection facilities for syr@@ inges and need@@ les should be made available in prisons
I am critical of this attitude of resignation
Drug abuse in institutions would then be legitimised
Instead , efforts must be directed at making institutions drug@@ -free
One of Mrs Mal@@ li@@ ori 's initiatives is aimed at sof@@ tening the legislation on drug crime through the very dubious proposal of introducing alternatives to prison sentences
This whole discussion about the best way to kill neatly or to fight a war without killing any civilians is in itself surreal
For our part , we are using this opportunity to protest against the imperialist war against Iraq
We voted in favour of the few passages that propose banning anti-personnel mines , while being aware that the proposals are quite ir@@ resolute and will not become a reality
These texts distort the problems and damage the credibility of our parliamentary institution
The danger of chemical contamination , especially during combustion , is indeed high and hence the justification for the protection advised by western military man@@ u@@ als available on the Internet
In any event , when dormant in nature , depleted uranium is no more dangerous than the lead in hunting car@@ tri@@ dges or in water pipes
The use of pl@@ uton@@ i@@ um@@ /@@ mo@@ x ' or other nuclear waste to replace depleted uranium , should indeed be subject to careful scrutiny
The presence of uranium 2@@ 36 in blood tests of soldiers who served in Kosovo - as one newspaper has claimed - could indicate that this is the case
Lastly , I would highlight the political significance of the parliamentary group of the PPE-DE having withdrawn from the joint resolution and having voted against
Greece too has soldiers who have been affected and are now suffering from various forms of cancer and being treated in secret
These weapons are scattered all over Greece
The government , having initially lied and denied that the armed forces had any such weapons , has since tried to play down the problem
The good old international community , despite its meddling in terrorist laws and rapid reaction forces , has done nothing to ban depleted uranium weapons
The European Parliament resolution makes some good points but fails to come down in favour of a complete ban , merely calling for a moratorium pending further study
Over recent years cosmetic sur@@ gery has made considerable progress and the techniques used have reached a more than satisfactory level of safety
However , if the danger warnings are increased and consumers are over@@ protected , doctors could become dis@@ heartened
Let us take the example of Ca@@ es@@ are@@ ans
They have dramatically increased , because women are gri@@ pped by the idea of a lower risk
Therefore it is their trust in the medical profession that is called into question
While we need to protect patients , we also need to preserve the service providers by placing a degree of trust in them
It is , however , going too far for Europe to say that women should protect themselves
We should not regulate ' self-@@ esteem and other conceptual alternatives to breast implants ' in Europe
Nor should Parliament urge Member States to ' concentrate on promoting and securing acceptance of the image of women as they actually are '
Europe must not prescribe a ' national bre@@ ast-@@ im@@ plant register ' or annual ' compulsory after@@ care examinations '
This reinforces the patronising image that the European Union already has
It would be much better for Member States to issue their own legislation in this regard
We are always getting bogged down in details
Is this Europe 's business ?
Sometimes you wonder which bureaucr@@ at sitting behind his desk thought this one up
I have therefore voted against the resolution
This report concerns a private and sensitive subject for many women who , either for a@@ esthetic or medical reasons , have had breast im@@ plant operations carried out
We support the idea that all patients involved should be provided with information about risks , alternative options and post-@@ operative investigations
What is more , certain parts of the report concern patient issues , which do not come within the EU 's area of competence
In our view , breast implants are therefore an issue , important though it is , that is better dealt with at national level
We have therefore chosen to vote against the report as such
Public health is a national area , involving national legislative competence
It is essential to foster the values of self-@@ esteem and tolerance as alternatives to breast implants , something that is done in items 15 and 16
The next item is the Commission statement on the crisis in the steel sector and the measures to be taken at Community level
Commissioner Byrne has the floor
Mr President , the European steel industry has been through a difficult period over the last 20 years
There was a need for an overall restructuring of the sector
Nowadays the European steel industry is very competitive
In order to maintain their global position , however , companies need to engage in a continuous process of adapting their structures
The Commission is acutely aware of the need for citizens and workers to feel secure in tax@@ ing times
We have observed again in recent weeks extremely different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large-scale operations of corporate restructuring
In other cases these operations were launched and implemented with no care or concern at all for those affected
On every occasion in the past , the Commission has always highlighted the following basic principles
Firstly , decisions on corporate restructuring remain a prerogative , as well as a responsibility , of management
This means that when contemplating actions likely to have serious social consequences , companies should always actively search and choose the less damaging solutions
Secondly , when dismis@@ sals prove to be inevitable , the utmost must be done to improve the employability of those concerned
This requires anticipation and adequate management of those processes
Thirdly , nothing can justify the absence of timely and effective information and consultation with workers ' representatives
These basic assertions attract a wide consensus in Europe
It is , thankfully , increasingly rare to see companies embarking on damaging restructuring operations , ignoring these fundamental concerns , but it does sometimes happen
Ar@@ cel@@ or took a number of positive and productive steps , well before the recent announcement measures had already commenced , to anticipate the problems
Again recently , the management reaffirmed its intention to enter into effective consultations with workers ' representatives at all levels
This extensive programme is serious and is considered to be so by all stakeholders
The three seats on the board for workers ' representatives , although there is currently no legal obligation for this , also illustrate that same positive approach
This in fact anticipates the European Company Statute
We have built over recent years in the European Union a wide range of instruments that meet these concerns
The directives on collective redundancies , transfers of undertakings , information and consultation and the European Works Councils directive are some examples
The most recent texts clearly promote upstream worker involvement , notably on strategic issues and on the foreseeable evolution of employment within companies
The two cases I mentioned before can only confirm those assertions , one positively and one negatively
It is up to national courts and other authorities to ensure compliance with Community directives
The Commission will , of course , fulfil its ultimate role of control of the application of Community law if breaches are not effectively sanctioned
Those aspects will constitute some of the main elements of the forthcoming revision of the European Works Councils Directive
Those good practices go well beyond the information and consultation of workers
It is also useful to recall in this context other initiatives of the Commission relating to corporate social responsibility , social dialogue and the European Monitoring Centre on Change
Besides those policy aspects , our immediate concern today is the recent cases of restructuring
The Commission would like to state clearly that , above all , we share your regret and concern on the possible social consequences for those who may be affected
I sincerely hope that every effort is made to prevent or atten@@ u@@ ate them through dialogue between all parties concerned
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I must admit to the Commissioner that I found his speech extraordinarily disappointing
He gave a series of general considerations on a situation that we are well aware of
The decision taken by Ar@@ cel@@ or to gradually close its ho@@ t-@@ working steel facilities on its continental sites was , of course , received with concern in the regions concerned
Along with this commitment there was a commitment in return from workers to make efforts towards productivity to ensure that the site was competitive
The workers ' commitments were kept but U@@ sin@@ or 's have now been betra@@ yed and the workers feel they have been du@@ ped
This is why all of the movements in the region and also the Wal@@ lo@@ on Government and the Belgian Federal Government are now asking Ar@@ cel@@ or to explain itself
I think it is important that the European Commission also takes this stance
The resolution that we have all put forward together has the prime objective of ensuring that Ar@@ cel@@ or keeps its commitments
We should not therefore envisage first of all restructuring processes with Coc@@ ker@@ ill-@@ S@@ amb@@ re , and then with U@@ sin@@ or
The Liège region has already experienced and paid heavily for the steel crisis
What is needed now to ensure restructuring is time
That raises a number of questions at European level
I will not say any more , Mr President , in order to allow my colleagues to speak
It should also be pointed out that the Commission should not be a spectator , but play an active public role in managing steel at European Union level
The resolution put forward contains some themes that we see as essential
I hope that the Commission is able to answer four quite specific questions on these four themes
In other words , is the Commission aware that it still has a responsibility under Article 3 of the ECSC Treaty , or has it forgotten that article ?
In particular this involves respecting a number of collective agreements
Finally , the Commission needs to play its role as a public power , to make European employment law and company law a reality
Many sectors are affected by this , particularly the steel industry
People say that the context of a slowdown in growth is not favourable
It is true that the majority of companies wear out this argument that restructuring and closures of sites are necessary in order to deal with international competition
However , let us state the fact that company management take a fundamentally financial approach and not always an industrial one , far from it , when defining their strategy
Their aim is to achieve maximum profitability , without worrying about the social or environmental consequences
That often leads to relocations to third countries where rules on such matters are practically non-existent
Commissioner , you referred to Me@@ tal@@ euro@@ p
I think , however , that the situation raises the broader question of what ambitions Europe intends to have in terms of drawing up a new Treaty ?
Is the European Union going to accept such behaviour from companies which , we should remember , have greatly benefited from European political aid
You of course referred to existing legislation that needs to be applied
Nevertheless , I think that new measures need to be taken to inform unions and works committees about the aid received
Measures also need to be adopted forcing those companies to account for how they have used loans granted and to reimburse them if they do not respect the commitments made
If that is not done , Commissioner , we will not move towards a Union of solidarity but towards a Union of terrible opposition between employees and between citizens
With regard to social governance , we need to legislate even more
I think that new European legislative texts need to be more effective in forcing companies established in the Union to take on their responsibilities
The Commission and the Member States need to adopt a more pro-active strategy in response to industrial restructuring and its social impact
I think that this is also a question of ethics
It is precisely the opposite approach that we need to promote in order to have a fresh impetus for industry in Europe
Employees should have new rights in companies at all levels
I am of course referring to the legislation on European committees
I therefore think that the Union should force the companies concerned to do more to take into account the alternative proposals from unions before making any decisions
Commissioner , you said that the restructuring of companies in the steel sector , but also in the metal sector , went back a long way
It goes back 25 years
What I would like to highlight is the difference that there is now in the nature of those restructuring processes
You are aware that , 20 years ago , entire regions were abandoned and employees stripped of their jobs in the name of modernisation and productivity
These stories no longer make sense , which makes them depressing
In other words , people are either revol@@ ted or completely depressed by them
They particularly despair of Europe , because all of the restructuring processes are taking place at European level
closing something here , buying something else here , in Poland in the case of that company
So everyone feels like they are competing with everyone else , which is a point that I would like to stress
Should we talk about G@@ len@@ c@@ or , the corrupt shareholder , as there are people in this House who do not like names to be mentioned ?
I think that we should also mention the terrible pollution of sites and serious threats to the health of employees , their children and their families
Are companies pre@@ d@@ ators taking advantage as the shareholders dictate and then leaving all the damage in the hands of the public authorities ?
Or will Europe equip itself to regulate that and impose some restrictions ?
There are some very simple things that can be done
It is essential that we increase the power of employees on a European scale
Employees need to be able to discuss and take part in company strategies , coordinate and fight their battles together
Everyone here has condemned the Commission 's declaration as lacking in ambition
It is true that it is lacking in ambition , I am not going to say otherwise
I would ask that this be considered in the debate on the social Europe within the Convention
' the Convention is pushing aside the social Europe '
Do we want citizens to have lost all hope in Europe ?
I want the Commission to be able to say no to restructuring that is violating European legislation
And in my opinion , that comes under the Convention
Otherwise that Europe will be depressing , and believe me , the people will not support it when they are consulted by referendum
That is not the only thing , however , that demonstrates that the type of problem being raised here is not only regional but also European
The problem is not only confined to the steel industry
The action that we can take today involves enforcing the right to control the use of public funds , far beyond promises and declarations
However , currently it appears that the resources that we have are , in my opinion , insufficient
what is our ambition for the Europe of tomorrow ?
This debate is , therefore indeed about the social future , but also about the economic future of Europe
National governments and parliaments , but also the Commission , therefore urgently need to equip themselves with effective tools to manage both an economic Europe and a social Europe
En@@ forcing the right to legislate in order to better manage the future is not a question of ability but a question of political will
A resolution on the steel industry will be adopted soon
I am aware that this phrase might make people laugh , but I stand by it
There is no end to this arbitrary phenomenon
Commissioner , you presented Ar@@ cel@@ or as the good student of Europe
In my opinion , this international steel company is doing a dreadful thing , which is both heinous and ridiculous
Not content with abandoning its commitments to Coc@@ ker@@ ill - developing technological innovation , renewing tools , promoting employment - Ar@@ cel@@ or is making threats
Its directors are announcing that rationalisation must continue , otherwise they could close earlier , or even straight away
And the loc@@ k-@@ out of nineteenth century capitalism is suddenly re-@@ emerging out of the mouths of its directors
That it what is heinous , Commissioner
Unfortunately we are not talking about sponsorship , art or sport today , but the future of a region
And on this subject , Ar@@ cel@@ or sees itself as being reassuring
It is promising a restructuring plan and early retirement
Commissioner , finally give us the means to support coherent , integrated European policies , bearing the stamp of the economy , no doubt , but also socially convincing
Mrs Bo@@ o@@ ger@@ d-@@ Qu@@ a@@ ak has the floor , and I would like to welcome her back to this House
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it might appear somewhat strange that someone who does not live in the area concerned should be taking an interest in this problem
I was therefore a little disappointed with your input with regard to what the European Union could do
In particular , the World Trade Organisation and the OECD still offer great opportunities
We have funds in Europe that we can work with
It is not as if the Commission is incapable of doing anything at all
Finally I would like to draw your attention to the European social funds
I am very much in favour of a liberal Europe , but it must be a social liberal Europe
I also find that your speech gives too little indication of the incentives there could be both at European and at national level
Mr President , the factory closures planned by Ar@@ cel@@ or are scandalous
I know that the problem is not only with the steel industry
At the moment in France the airline Air Li@@ b is also shutting up shop and making 3 200 people redundant
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I also found the Commissioner 's response distressing
We should not , however , bury our heads in the sand , because here we are facing a perfect example of deregulated globalisation
Commissioner Lamy therefore told us , before this House , that the European Union intended to defend its industries and jobs by taking all available measures
Mr Lamy also stipulated that these defence measures should take place within the strict framework of the Union 's international commitments , namely within the World Trade Organisation
We are now facing a dis@@ organised world trade system , where Ar@@ cel@@ or did not wait for market regulation because in fact that is what this is about
At European Union level , we are therefore becoming a real Wil@@ d West in social terms
They force national social systems to compete with each other and drive countries to restrict workers ' rights
Furthermore , these companies receive subsidies and sometimes even privileges
They do not respect their commitments , and find every possible loophole , even those that can still be found in the enlargement system
In any case , we certainly cannot continue to infringe workers ' rights as we are doing
It is essential to ensure that companies shoulder their social responsibilities on a purely voluntary basis
In order to do so , we need a number of commitments
What is happening in the steel sector could have been anticipated
The Commission seems to be realising it for the first time , and we could be surprised
Mr President , I have listened with great care and attention and interest to this crucial debate
One cannot but be moved by the strength and passion with which Members of Parliament have expressed their views on this unfortunate issue
A number of interesting ideas were developed throughout the debate and the Commission will study all of them with great care
Most of the points raised were dealt with in my introductory remarks and I will not go into detail on them now
Let me underline again the basic principle according to which decisions on corporate restructuring are a prerogative of management , but also its responsibility
A wide consensus seems to exist in Europe on the way to address crises resulting from the need for companies to adapt , from industrial change and from corporate restructuring
Let me reaffirm again the importance of effective , timely and comprehensive information and consultation of workers ' representatives
You have nevertheless expressed other types of concerns to which I would like to give you the Commission 's preliminary view
Before I do that I would like to pick up one or two points that were made
There were references , for instance , to the European Coal and Steel Community , and I was asked whether Articles 3 and 5 have any application in these circumstances
It appears to be the case that Articles 3 and 5 no longer have application because the ECSC is no longer operational
Nor indeed are state aids possible
There is no competence at EU level to deal with many of the issues that have been raised by honourable Members in this debate this afternoon
I can only quote what Mrs Z@@ rihen said in her contribution just a moment ago , when she said the legislative arsenal is insufficient
That is indeed the case
I shall now deal with some of the issues you raised
Those defensive measures include , besides intensive bilateral contacts with a view to solving the conflict , retaliation measures and using the WTO disputes settlement mechanism
My colleague , Commissioner Lamy , is forcefully pursuing that particular issue
Another issue that was raised in the debate was the issue surrounding the issue of enlargement
There are issues related to compliance with standards in the new Member States , notably in the social and environmental fields
I should like to make a few points on that
After the expiry of the ECSC Treaty , the only possibility lies in the European Social Fund and in interventions from the Structural Funds
The main goal in the long term must be the re@@ conversion of local industrial activities
This will have a much greater impact on the regions than direct social aid to the employees , although some transitional measures can be considered
The same rules apply to the countries applying for accession and with regard to new aid
There were also references to making public aid dependent upon the maintenance of employment
Generally speaking , public aid to companies is already subject to those kinds of conditions
A number of the existing instruments specifically link the obtaining of state aid funds to the obligation to keep people employed during a minimum period
Contin@@ uous employment should also be granted to workers in the case of aid for the recruitment of disadvantaged and disabled workers
Some reference was made to the alleged ambitions of one of the companies involved to make acquisitions in Poland
The Commission underlines that it only permits concentrations which are compatible with the common market
In its evaluation the Commission comes to a conclusion only about the competitive aspects without intervening in the industrial policy of a private company
I should also say that the Commission has no information to the effect that any such plans for acquisition by that company have been successful
Finally , industrial change has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion
However , it also provides opportunities when anticipated , prepared for and managed
Dialogue , transparency , proper worker involvement , anticipation , risk prevention and the development of employability are the key elements of our European response to this phenomenon
Let us do our best to build the instruments of a legislative or other nature which can promote these principles
To conclude this debate , I have received four motions for resolutions
The next item is the debates on cases of breaches of human rights , democracy and the rule of law
Mr Ribeiro e Castro has the floor for a point of order
The parliamentary delegation was surprised that this motion was not submitted for its consideration
The situation in the region is apparently quite delicate
The delegation has followed it closely and the members , particularly the delegation 's chairman , would have preferred to have the opportunity to study the motion
Mr Ribeiro e Castro , I fully understand the request made by the chair of your delegation
Please be aware that I understand your request , but I am obliged to apply the rules of our institution
B5-0@@ 13@@ 5/@@ 2003 , by Mr Van den Berg and others , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the situation in Kaz@@ ak@@ h@@ stan@@ ;
Mr President , both Kazakhstan and Tajikistan are authoritarian regimes or dictatorships where fundamental freedoms are flouted , political activity suppressed and where torture still takes place
We naturally support the calls to respect democratic rights and freedoms in these two countries and we condemn the executions that continue to take place in Tajikistan
These trusts are fighting it out with billions of dollars - 13 million , more than in Russia - for the Kaz@@ akh energy reserves , which are considerable
Nor does it bother the building groups , including Bou@@ y@@ gues , which have made considerable amounts of money thanks to the construction of the new capital , A@@ stan@@ a
Our point of concern is about the development of democracy and the further cur@@ tail@@ ment of the freedom of the press
There are therefore quite a few examples of intimidation
This does not promote the development of a democratic constitutional state
In view of the cooperation agreements we have signed , we , the European Union , are partly responsible for our relations with Kazakhstan
That point in particular causes us concern , but it also makes us more responsible for the implementation of the agreements and for Kazakhstan 's continued development
True friends tell each other the truth@@ ; we must be able to do this in this relationship
I hope that the Commission and the Council do in fact intend to play this role on the basis of the treaties we have signed
These countries are far from the eyes of the Union , and therefore far from its control
How else can we interpret these cases of intimidation and persecution of journalists and the opposition ?
What is the historical precedent for these fixed or arbitrary trials suffered recently by people such as Mrs Pe@@ tr@@ us@@ ho@@ va , Mr Ab@@ by@@ az@@ ov and Mr Z@@ ha@@ ki@@ y@@ an@@ ov ?
More than a decade after the collapse of the USSR , these kinds of mis@@ adven@@ tures and ali@@ bis cannot be tolerated
Tomorrow , certain former Soviet republics will join our Union
Today , already , the Union is concentrating a key economic and industrial force in Europe and the world
It must use this as a political lever to demol@@ ish the non-democratic regimes of these third countries that are so eager to obtain Community investment
I would like the European Union to assess political and human rights developments in Kazakhstan
This is entirely justified , as the S@@ tic@@ h@@ ting Fried@@ en@@ s@@ sti@@ m@@ me N@@ eder@@ land even mentions an unfortunate trend that has been ongoing for the past eighteen months
Two non-@@ registered B@@ ap@@ tist communities were attacked at the beginning of this month
On Saturday 1 February police brutally ra@@ ided a prayer centre in the municipality of Y@@ ev@@ gen@@ y@@ ev@@ ka in the north-east of Kazakhstan
Mr President , I apologise to my colleagues in this debate for not anticipating that the debate was going to be brought forward
I had the opportunity to visit Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan briefly with the Central Asian Delegation at the end of September and the beginning of October 2002
I have to say that all the signs are that there is a danger of Kazakhstan slipping into authoritarianism
There is increasing intimidation and persecution of the press
The case of Mr Du@@ vanov , sentenced to three and a half years in jail is well known and has been mentioned
The case of Ir@@ ina Pe@@ tr@@ us@@ ho@@ va with Res@@ publi@@ ka weekly , sentenced to one and a half years in jail is another example
And there is a series of new criminal cases
A new law on the creation of opposition parties requires 50 000 citizens ' signatures before they can be registered
Many of our parties in the European Union would not be able to register that level of support
Of course , there is the increasing pressure on the opposition
Clearly , we want a dialogue in Kazakhstan between the government and the op@@ position; we want them to respect international law
In the meantime , we ask the Council and Commission to raise these questions firmly at the next meeting between the Council , the Commission and the government of Kazakhstan
Mr President , can I reassure you that we have not changed offices for the delegation to Central Asia
I am still vice-president , Mr Di Pietro is still president and Mr Koukiadis is still vice-president as well
Mr Mus@@ sa very kindly stood in for us at a meeting yesterday
We welcome the genuine dialogue that we have with the Kaz@@ akh Government , parliament , the opposition and the wider community
Kazakhstan is travelling the road from a Soviet republic to an independent and democratic state
Our task is to help keep them firmly on that road
pollutants , locu@@ sts and AIDS , to name but three
We understand how far Kazakhstan has already travelled towards democracy and human rights
They understand our need to air concerns when they arise and when they are brought to us
To some extent , the tabling of this motion has already brought some answers
The ombudsman system , for example , could be expanded
Perhaps the European Union could help them do just that
But at least it is the first ombudsman system in a C@@ IS country
Religious minorities were targeted by the government , but I am pleased to hear now that has been vetoed by the president
Mr Du@@ vanov 's trial was closed to the public
The US and Dutch embassies may have been represented but why were not the Kaz@@ akh human rights groups ?
The Council of Opposition Parties has now been established , although one of the main opposition parties is not represented on it
We need to know more about the 19 January presidential law that was brought in on political parties
It inhi@@ bits the ability of some opposition movements to operate legally in the country
Kazakhstan must not slip on its road
The concerns that we have in this motion for a resolution need to be tabled
Mr President , over the past years , democratic conditions in most of the countries of Central Asia have deteriorated
However , the Commission understands why the focus of Parliament 's attention in this debate is on Kazakhstan
Once considered one of the ' hope@@ ful@@ s ' in the region , the past two years have seen a crack@@ down on political opposition and critical media
Especially hard hit were those who had the courage to criticise corruption at the highest level , involving the President and his family
The Commission has furthermore viewed with great concern the campaign of intimidation that has been going on against a great number of critical media in Kazakhstan
The perpetrators of these crimes have never been apprehen@@ ded , and many cases have simply been closed
The Commission also agrees that the recent court case against Mr Du@@ vanov on rape charges was marred by grave irregularities
We therefore strongly believe that the trial should be reviewed
President Prodi underlined our deep concern over Kazakhstan 's recent democratic record during the President 's visit to Brussels on 29 November 2002
On the other hand , it is important to take a number of positive developments in Kazakhstan into consideration as well
Pris@@ ons have been transferred from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Justice , and we hope that pre-@@ trial detention facilities will soon follow
A law on the hum@@ anisation of prison conditions has been passed and a serious effort seems to be being made to implement prison reform
A ' Standing Council ' for further democratisation and development in civil society was approved by Presidential Decree on 29 December 2002
It is to be hoped that its recommendations , for example those on the Law on Political Parties , will be followed up
The Commission notes that Parliament 's resolution focuses on Kazakhstan only
The Commission believes , however , that the matter of human rights in Kazakhstan is to be viewed in its regional context
It cannot be denied that there has been a crack@@ down on non-governmental media and opposition in Kazakhstan
We believe that the EU can continue to have an impact on democratic conditions in these countries through critical but constructive dialogue under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements
We have deeper concerns regarding Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan , on which Parliament 's resolution remains silent
Uzbekistan has no independent press , whereas Turkmenistan has no press at all worthy of the name
Opposition parties do not exist in these two countries
Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have been under the close scrutiny of human rights watch@@ dogs for some time now because of the deterioration in democratic conditions
This scrutiny has certainly been justified
But let us not forget that in Uzbekistan , and certainly in Turkmenistan , for years there has been no democracy at all left to deteriorate
Through constructive dialogue and targeted support , the EU can still make a difference in these countries
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at the end of the debate
B5-0@@ 14@@ 1/@@ 2003 , by Mr Van den Berg and others , on behalf of the PSE Group , on the situation in Venezuel@@ a;
Mr President , for some time now , the European Parliament has been monitoring the situation in Venezuela with interest
I should like very specifically to draw attention to the delegation of MEPs that visited the country to assess the damage produced by the floods in the state of Var@@ gas
When it returned , this delegation drew up a resolution and mobilised considerable financial resources in order to express the EU 's solidarity with those affected
Moreover , this is actually contrary to Venezuela 's peaceful traditions
I believe that this Parliament must respond and lose no time in setting out its priorities for helping these countries , which are subject to many threats
In the case of Venezuela , moreover , we have to obtain a peaceful , negotiated and democratic solution , given the grave situation being experienced by that country
My group condemns the instigators of the coup of 11 April who irresponsibly attempted to over@@ throw the country 's democratic , legitimate constitutional institutions
Most of all , we condemn the Council of the European Union 's complicity with the instigators of the coup at the time
We have not yet forgotten that the Presidency of the Union immediately sent a message of support to the instigators of the coup , a black day for European diplomacy
It is important to respect the Venezuelan Constitution , which was drawn up by a democratically elected assembly and equally democratically ratified by a huge majority by the Venezuelan citizens
This does not , of course , mean that we blindly support all the actions of the legitimate Venezuelan Government
Res@@ pec@@ ting the political experiment in Venezuela means respecting the dignity of a people that has decided to take its fate into its own hands
That is another reason why our group calls for the motion for a resolution we have drawn up together to be adopted without amendments
Firstly , there was a mini coup d' état on 11 April to ou@@ st President Cha@@ ve@@ z , who had been elected in 1998 in accordance with the Venezuelan constitution
Secondly , there was a civil strike , initiated at the beginning of December , which constituted a significant breach of the social fabric
Nor ought the issue of oil to be forgotten
Given this scenario of socio-political confrontation and crisis , government and opposition have turned to the international community in search of support in finding a negotiated democratic solution
To that extent , I should be grateful if we were all to support the motion for a resolution
The ties that bind us to the Venezuelan people and State run very deep
It dist@@ resses us to see the destruction of what was one of the most solid democracies and one of the most prosperous , stable and peaceful societies in Latin America
The unfortunate mandate of President Cha@@ ve@@ z , who it is true , was elected , bears enormous responsibility
We believe that our role is to encourage moderation , dialogue , the progress of democracy and respect for human rights
Our expression of respect for the Constitution , as included in the text , could be used improperly in Venezuela by one of the parties involved
Consequently , if we use the argument improperly in this context , we could be sending out the wrong signal
This is why we have requested a split vote for which we would also ask the Chamber 's support
Mr President , the crisis in Venezuela 's two-@@ party regime led to a solution 's being sought in terms of what we might call the populist panacea
In actual fact , this is not a phenomenon exclusive to Latin America
It is not , however , for us to tell the Venezuel@@ ans what to do
The motion for a resolution is not designed to recommend one course rather than another to the Venezuel@@ ans
What would be required would be for the European Parliament , together with other Community institutions , to intervene to help create a climate of understanding between the Venezuel@@ ans themselves
We hoped never again to have to discuss attempted cou@@ ps d' E@@ tat or situations in which the democratic institutions might be overturned
It is clear , therefore , that these types of methods have , in any case , not yet been completely eradicated from the continent
In our opinion , the worst is now passed
We welcome this fact and we therefore support the resolution to this effect
I wonder what the European Union can do in this regard and I fully endorse what Mr Salafranca has just said
Mr President , if I am not mistaken all of those who have drafted motions or spoken in this debate so far are from the Rom@@ ance part of Europe
Venezuela is a country that plays a significant role , and not only in economic terms thanks to its raw materials , oil and many other natural resources
It is a country that has made a very considerable contribution to the political stability of the Andean region over a very long period of time
That is why I welcome the efforts that Europe is making to help this country to recover its internal stability by intervening here
Firstly , emphasis is placed on the role of the Fri@@ ends of Venezuela , this group of countries that is making a particular effort to offer mediation here
Two countries in the European Union , namely Spain and Portugal , belong to this group and have a special responsibility here , which they are responding to magnific@@ ently
Secondly , the motion stresses how important it is for the European Parliament itself to have a presence on the spot
As I said , I would therefore appeal for the European Parliament 's offer to act as a mediator to be accepted
I do not mean that we want to go around telling other nations what to do
We do not have the right to do that , but we do have the duty to make our good offices available and to act as mediators
Mr President , the worst thing about this situation in Venezuela is that the two sides have stopped talking to each other
I hope that it will eventually be possible for us to build this bridge
The man in the street in the countries of Latin America is the one who will pay
Apart from getting the two sides talking , what else is to be done ?
I think that sooner or later we will have no alternative but to let the people decide
Latin America 's reputation for not respecting constitutions goes before it
This is all the more reason for us to ensure that where a constitution is actually recognised at international level , we do stick to it
If it is to be amended then it should be with the agreement of both sides to perhaps enable elections to be held at an early stage
But as I see it the only way out seems to be for the people to decide , and no one else
However , all the striking businessmen managed to do was to crip@@ ple the country 's economy before re@@ treating in disarray
The days of imperialists setting up dictators everywhere are over
The Commission has approved a project to assist the O@@ AS in its efforts to implement possible agreements reached between the parties of the O@@ AS medi@@ ated dialogue
The three components are included in the agenda of the ' Negoti@@ ating Table '
The debate is closed
The vote will take place shortly , when we have concluded the debates
Mr President , I speak on behalf of my friend , Mr Van Orden , and the British Conservatives
I also speak on behalf of the oppressed people of Zimbabwe who are crying out for justice
Yet again we find ourselves having to discuss Zimbabwe
The situation in Zimbabwe has gone from bad to worse , with enforced starvation and continuing human rights abuses and political oppression
However , the most urgent issue at this moment relates to action to be taken by the EU itself
It is unbelievable that there was a need for a lengthy Council discussion on the renewal of sanctions , which must take effect by 18 February
Who would believe that their renewal would depend upon the Council 's agreement to Mugabe visiting Paris
Mugabe is the prime instig@@ ator of the oppression and misery of the Zimbabwean people and the supposed main target of EU action
The problem with EU sanctions has been their lack of rigorous enforcement
Now the plan is to allow Mugabe and his en@@ tourage to travel to Paris
No wonder that the EU is not taken seriously
After all , we should not be trying to find ways of helping Mugabe to evade our own sanctions
Instead we should be trying to make sanctions more effective
If anything , they need to be widened in their scope
We should not be surprised if African leaders are half-hearted in their support for international measures when the EU is seen to lack resolve
The EU 's weakness is in marked contrast to the brave stand taken by the Zimbabwean cr@@ ic@@ ke@@ ters , Hen@@ ry O@@ long@@ a and An@@ dy F@@ lower
) we are making a silent plea to those responsible to stop the abuse of human rights in Zimbabwe
In so doing , we pray that our small action may help restore san@@ ity and dignity to our nation
They have put their lives and their livelihoods at risk by their courage
They deserve all the support we can give to them and to the suffering people of Zimbabwe
I call upon Members to support the resolution without amendment
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe that this is an example of exactly what we must not do
What Mr Deva has just said is the opposite of what must be done in this type of case
I think , on the contrary , that we have made a serious mistake
Recognising human rights abuses in Zimbabwe is one thing , but assisting the opposition and doing all we can to establish a democracy is quite another
I still believe that our serious mistake was precisely cancelling the sitting of the equal ACP@@ -European Union assembly
Instead of that , we have strengthened all those who support Mr Mugabe
We have provided him with superb publicity
In order to do that , we need to sit down with them and hold discussions with them
Mr President , there has been a little confusion
Mr Sylla was not one of the authors of the resolution
He is opposing the resolution
I do not know how that mistake was made
We in the PSE Group are supporting the resolution and will be opposing the amendment from Mr Posselt , because it waters down the criticism of Mr Mugabe
Zimbabwe is no longer a democratic country
Parliamentary , presidential and all local elections recently have been characterised by intimidation , repression , voting fraud and state-@@ sponsored political violence
We have a situation where over 7 million Zimbabweans - over half the population - are on the brink of starvation
If you want government-@@ controlled food , you are required to have a Z@@ A@@ NU@@ -PF membership card
Unemployment is running at 70 % , inflation is at over 100 % and 50 % of the land is no longer being farm@@ ed
We also have the usual African problem of AIDS
Parliament has consistently called for a widening and rigorous enforcement of sanctions , as well as other measures , to make international action against the Mugabe regime more effective
Sanctions against the Mugabe regime should continue without interruption and without exemption
The charges against the opposition , against Morgan Tsvangirai , are spurious and un@@ substantiated
We want to extend the existing sanctions to make them stronger and more effective
We want the Council and Commission to provide more information on the freezing of the bank accounts of those subject to sanctions
We want wider sanctions against the Zimbabwean regime , including an international sports and culture boycott
That would not increase the suffering of the population of Zimbabwe
We support the belated stance of the England cr@@ ic@@ ket team which has now refused to play in Zimbabwe
It is time for further action to be taken and for the sanctions to be strengthened and reinforced
How in God 's name can we get out of this ambiguous situation ?
This matter is once again dividing us , even though together we want to condemn the sanctions
My group resolutely argues in favour of maintaining the dialogue , and of promul@@ g@@ ating sanctions that can be imposed , but not of invoking sanctions that rule out any dialogue
We have just heard how things are in Venezuela , where there is no dialogue
They are asking for a dialogue there@@ ; in this case a dialogue is actually necessary
There are many paragraphs in our resolution that we would like to see approved
Mr President , there will never be a European foreign policy as long as Member States continue to follow their own agenda
Not even a Convention will help bring one about
The European Union is not even capable of pursuing a consistent , vigorous , clear policy with regard to Zimbabwe
We must not forget that our severe sanctions are the only alternative to punishments that affect the population
The people of Zimbabwe are already suffering far too much
Yet France is riding roughshod over the agreements by inviting Mugabe , and in doing so is putting the credibility of the European Union on the line
It now looks as if the Council is intending to relax the sanctions by introducing exception provisions
The opposite is , however , urgently needed
Fortunately our Parliament is consistent , or at least most of the parties are , and we must keep it that way
If Europe is not consistent , how can we expect African countries to be ?
It is most unfortunate that South Africa and Nigeria seem to be standing up for Mugabe and want the Commonwealth 's sanctions to be lifted
Free , honest elections are needed soon
Show trials against opposition leaders must be stopped immediately , and the United Nations must appoint a special human rights rapporteur
Only unconditional actions against the regime can release the people from their suffering
The starving , terrorised victims of the former resistance her@@ o must be able to count on our support
It is time Member States put their own commercial agendas aside and pulled out all the stops for human rights on a European level
State terrorism combined with corruption and drought are converging to create a national catastrophe
The situation in Zimbabwe once again calls for an urgent debate
2 million Zimbabweans , more than half the population , are living on the brink of starvation
The shocking aspect in all of this is the fact that the government is abusing the distribution of food as a weapon in its fight against its political opponents
Fear currently prevails in the country
As the economic crisis worsen@@ s , government repression is plum@@ bing new depths
Increasing numbers of cases of torture are being reported , including such things as the administration of electric shocks , poisoning and rape
Being a supporter of the MDC is in itself life-threatening
This is true of its leaders even more than of its sympath@@ isers
Morgan Tsvangirai , Wel@@ sh@@ man N@@ cu@@ be and Ren@@ son Gas@@ el@@ a were recently accused of high treason for spurious reasons
Against this sinister background , it is absolutely shocking that France has now invited this dictator to the Fran@@ co-@@ African Summit conference in Paris
The excuse that the summit starts on 19 February while the sanctions were originally in force until 18 February sounds lame
On the basis of paragraph 12 , therefore , I vigorously condemn this unilateral element in French policy
It is not , at the moment , the only one
I call on the Council and Commission to unanimously implement the renewed sanctions in full without tolerating any opt outs
Regrettably , it is necessary to extend the sanctions imposed on the Mugabe regime
I have to take issue with what Mr Sylla said
The sanctions that we introduced do not actually affect the general public
The only people that are hit by them are those who in any case have the money to travel
The result is clear to see in countries such as Côte d' Ivoire and Congo
On the contrary , it is important for Europe to present a united front
I therefore welcome the fact that Portugal would rather postpone the EU-Africa summit than allow President Mugabe to travel here
This is intolerable and our condemnation is un@@ sw@@ er@@ ving
A policy of sanctions has been in place for a year now
We also know that these policies of sanctions always require a process to be in place
I wish to propose an alternative plan , even though I have seen that a majority in this House has already been achieved
Furthermore , we should launch a massive movement of positive solidarity towards Morgan Tsvangirai , who is being unjustly and seriously persecuted in his country
We in this House have the ability to do this and to mobilise European public opinion
Mr Tsvangirai has , as you know , already been nominated twice for the Sakharov Prize , which Parliament awards each year
La@@ un@@ ching a massive movement of support for Morgan Tsvangirai to receive the Sakharov Prize at the end of this year would be much more effective than any policy of sanctions
The Commission closely follows the human rights situation in Zimbabwe
It is aware that the conditions remain volatile and is deeply concerned regarding the increased incidence of politically motivated violence observed recently
These measures redirect funds to social sectors and to areas which benefit directly the population
This is for a renewable period of one year
The Commission is informed that approximately EUR 7@@ 70 000 have been frozen in accounts in Member States or their dependent territories in accordance with the Council 's position
The Commission is particularly concerned about the food crisis in Zimbabwe and has been very actively involved in responding to the situation
Between April and December 2002 , we committed about EUR 80 million in emergency aid and humanitarian aid
The Commission believes that all avenues for dialogue should be explored to improve the situation in Zimbabwe
The debate is closed
We shall now proceed to the vote
The next item is the vote on the crisis in the steel sector
Mr President , I welcome the vote on the resolution and would like to emphasise two points
It seems to me that , with regard to Wal@@ lo@@ on regional power , the Commission should consider such action
On behalf of us all , Mrs Laguiller expressed opposition in her speech to the business closures and redundancies planned by Ar@@ cel@@ or
The only way to prevent finance groups from acting is to prohibit mass redundancies and guarantee workers ' salaries by taking funds from profits
It is therefore out of the question for us to sanction this text
The only reason we did not vote against it is because it proposes a few additional prerogatives for trade unions and we did not wish to oppose these
R@@ ed@@ und@@ ancies , however , are not more justified simply because the trade unions have been consulted
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned
We are very hesitant about giving Community policy a larger role when it comes to forests
We believe that the basic conditions within the EU vary so much that it is questionable what added value such a Community policy would bring
On the basis of that approach , we chose to vote against those items concerned with incorporating the prevention of forest fires into the regulation
The risk is that , in the interests of monitoring , this would divert a lot of resources from other areas
What is more , fire prevention measures are already a part of the EU Regulation on Rural Development
In the final vote , we chose , in spite of our hes@@ itations , to vote in favour of the report
Whatever some in this Parliament may say or wish , the European Union has absolutely no legal competence on the subject of abortion
Each person has the right to their own views , and I do not deny that different ethical frameworks exist in different Member States
This is not the issue
The issue is where and how the European Union has a legal right to act
In this respect , the report proposes an outrageous abuse of power and competence by the Union
As an Irish Member of Parliament , I cannot support such a monstrous violation of the constitutional right of the people I represent to decide policy with regard to abortion
This is a right which is enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and one which I will defend vigorously and unequivocally
The report would have gained a lot if Amendment No 53 had instead been approved
Right from the beginning , our attitude towards the recommendation has been that it focuses to an unduly high degree upon harm reduction
Our point of departure is that the most important measure for reducing the risks associated with drug dependence is that of preventing dependence itself
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 13 February 2003
Mr President , since submitting that request to you I now speak not just on behalf of the 36 Members but on behalf of my group
This arises in the context of a report apparently commissioned by Commissioner Kinnock prior to suspending the Commission accountant
Both the press and Commission sources have extensively quoted from this report
It is essential that the report is published in full forthwith so that the House has the full facts concerning this matter
For that reason , I propose to the House that tomorrow at 5 p
That document should be published and this House should be in a position to form a view in relation to it
I therefore ask for the House 's agreement to my proposal that the Commission is requested to come to this House at 5 p
tomorrow in order to deal with these serious allegations
Mr President , I thought the Lo@@ ch N@@ ess Mon@@ ster appeared in summer , but it now seems , on this issue , that it appears throughout the year
This is the fifth or sixth occasion on which Parliament has not followed its Rules of Procedure
Mr Evans has quite rightly said that these issues must be dealt with within the discharge procedure and must be debated in the Committee on Budgetary Control
Therefore , Mr President , we are opposed to this absolutely un@@ timely proposal and we believe that Parliament should continue its work in accordance with the established procedures
Mr President , it is important that we , as a House , are not rushed into precipit@@ ate action by the activities of a few journalists
As I understand it , this supposed story relates to a mem@@ o dated 21 May 2002
It would seem that the process has come a long way forward and this is probably a storm in a te@@ ac@@ up
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe we should be extremely careful
I do not know whether other Members have had a copy , and have not , as yet , had the chance to seek further information about this
For now , though , that is of secondary importance
I know nothing about this , though , and he has not even been invited
This really does make it a matter of urgency that we should have information about this
I really do not know any more when I am meant to do this if we are to be able to deal with this properly in committee
Mr President , the situation is , in fact , very simple
Either the Security Council votes on Tuesday evening , or it votes on Wednesday , or it votes on Thursday
In other words , it either votes before us or after us
If , however , the Security Council votes before we do , I think the European Parliament should adopt a position on this vote
I say this so that this may not be in doubt
Mr Cohn-Bendit , though , knows as well as any other Member of this House that we voted on this in December
That is why we oppose a new resolution
It is that Parliamentary resolution , therefore , that is still valid today
If the situation were to change , it would clearly also change as far as we are concerned
I am not going to speculate about what may happen in the Security Council
We still have time and this seems much more reasonable than adopting a closed position at the moment
Mr President , on behalf of the committee , I have asked that the vote on the resolution be postponed until the second part-session of March in Brussels
It seems to me that , if the House does not take a position this week , then we are impo@@ tent
We ought to be stressing very strongly our opposition to what the Americans are requesting and our opposition to any potential agreement by the Commission to such a request
In fact I would just like clarification on something
I am very pleased that we will be voting on this issue this week , because it is clear that information is already being passed on to the United States
We therefore urgently need this week to call a halt to this
Is it true that the Committee on Citizens ' Freedoms and Rights , Justice and Home Affairs is getting down to it this evening ?
My understanding on the question of substance is that it was the preference of the groups that the committee should prepare the resolution
Unless there is an indication to the contrary , that remains so
The only issue concerns when it should be voted
The clear decision of the House is that it should be voted on Thursday of this week , as foreseen in the draft agenda
The next item is the one-@@ minute speeches on matters of political importance
Mr President , I should like to convey to you a message I received when I was in New York last week
I met a group called ' September 11 Famili@@ es for Pe@@ aceful Tom@@ or@@ rows '
They are relatives of some of the victims of the 11 September atrocity and they asked me to convey to you and this House that they do not seek revenge
They do not want a war against Iraq in their name
They want a peaceful future for their children , the children of Iraq and the children of the world
I am happy to convey the views of the House to the American authorities , as I did to the Council some weeks ago
We consider their protest to be legitimate and we support them
This means the destruction of their status , their trade and their jobs , and we expect them to come to the European institutions bearing flow@@ ers
I find this police control unacceptable
We should listen to them , we should hear what they have to say and review the proposal for a directive accordingly
Mr President , I too have a complaint about police repression outside the building , but it relates to Members of this House and not to dock workers
I arrived from Basle in the bus , with a number of colleagues from various countries , to find the gates barred
There was no immediate security problem , there were no demonstrators in sight , but the French police refused us ad@@ mittance to the building
It is my understanding that for police from a Member State to obstruct parliamentarians in the course of carrying out their duties is contrary to the Treaties
It is certainly an affront to the dignity of this House
There was not a single demonstr@@ ator to be seen anywhere nearby , only soldiers protecting a building and not the Members of Parliament
This is the umpteenth time the city of Strasbourg and the French Government have made it impossible to enjoy working here in Strasbourg
Either our flights are being cancelled or our cars are being taken away , and now we are even being denied access to our own Parliament
I think that you must do something about this
Mr President , I would simply like to tell my fellow Members that I am somewhat surprised
On the one hand , they complain that there is no security in Brussels and that they are sometimes exposed to abuse
Here , where every measure is taken to guarantee your safety , you are not satisfied
Mr President , I should like to raise once more the case of the plan@@ e-@@ spotters in Greece
You will remember that they were arrested on 8 November 2001
That , eventually , was the good news
The bad news is that , over four months after their acqu@@ it@@ tal , their bail money has still not been returned
Mr President , there is something I should like to bring to your attention
A few days ago , I visited Turkey as part of a representation of six MEPs
May I start by saying that we were delighted that Turkey has made real progress towards the Copenhagen criteria over recent months
I should like to point out , however , that the former Member of Parliament , Leyla Zana , has been in prison for some ten years now
When Mr Er@@ do@@ gan 's political freedom and rights were violated when he was mayor of Istanbul , we defended his human rights and political freedom here in this Chamber
I should like to ask you to lobby the Turkish Government directly for the release of Leyla Zana , for her immediate and unconditional release
As you know , that is a long-standing position of Parliament
I am happy to correspond on that matter since you have raised it again , in the light of your visit
These women are accused of ordering the assassination
The only witness is an Estonian policeman who has declined to testify
For over 18 months , however , these women have been in prison without trial , in that they have never had a public hearing
All their hearings have taken place in camera
The offici@@ ally-@@ appointed lawyers have not provided them with any documents concerning their case or any information at all on their situation or the proceedings that are underway
I take note of that
Mr President , I would like to take advantage of the presence of the Commissioner , Mrs Reding , to ask her a specific question
sport as a tool for educating young people and combating the scourge of doping
This was to be a programme to prepare for the Year of Sport and it has been abolished
Rather than replying now , perhaps the Commissioner could take note of that and communicate the Commission 's view to the Member later
There is therefore another war that needs to be stopped
The April meeting is our chance to do so
We have a delegation participating in that
Perhaps Mr Cappato could be informed and then make direct contact with the colleagues who will represent us
The issue was discussed at some length in the Conference of Presidents in Strasbourg , two meetings ago
The issue has been handled correctly , in line with the Rules of Procedure
If colleagues have problems with the Rules , that is a separate issue
I will send you a note outlining the procedure that was followed and the interpretation of the relevant Rules
Mr President , I would like to speak on the basis of Rule 8 of our Rules of Procedure
in standing for this election , Mr Pasqua must have been aware of what the immediate consequences would be
It would seem that the competent authorities in my country have not informed you of the end of Mr Pasqua 's mandate
I can only confirm that so far , neither the services of the House nor I have received any such notification in respect of the individual named
I am sure the Rules were complied with
I have no quarrel with that
What does concern me is the political aspect
170 Members of this House simply asked for a debate and a small group of people decided , in a closed session , that there would be no debate
If we are democrats and believe this Parliament has meaning , then we should allow debate to flourish
That was an error of judgement , and not of legality
I take note of your point
I will send a response to you as well as to Mr Tannock
The request by 170 Members was for the establishment of a committee of inquiry
It was not a request to hold a debate
The Rules , as they stand , vest the Conference of Presidents with the authority to decide whether or not a committee of inquiry is set up
That procedure was followed in this case
I will nevertheless correspond with you concerning the details and interpretations
We can return to it if colleagues remain dissatisfied with the matter
We are not living in an era of autocratic regimes
We cooperate within a framework and countries have to tell other countries if for any reason they arrest their citizens
Mr President , Commissioners , I am particularly glad that you are here
Well , Mr President , Commissioner , the Basque people have suffered further abuse and discrimination from the Spanish institutions
This unusual fact calls into question the existence in Spain of the democratic principle of separation of public powers
This means there has been no defence , and furthermore means that this judgment is illegal
Not a single piece of incriminating evidence has been produced on the content of the newspaper , since it is a pluralist , objective and democratic publication
They have closed it simply because it defends the right of Basques to their own identity and to use their own language
Furthermore , the director of the newspaper was imprisoned and later freed
But he has accused the Civil Gu@@ ard of torture , which takes us even further back , if that is possible , to the times ?
We are running over the allotted time
Your point was well made but I would ask you to respect our time constraints
I apologise to colleagues who wished to speak but we have overrun our time
We have rules and I am doing my best to observe them
The next item is the Commission statement on the General Agreement on Trade in Services within the WTO , including cultural diversity
They are , moreover , reflected in the motions for resolutions tabled before this House
Before I present to you the European Union 's offers for opening up the services markets , I would briefly like to remind you what these negotiations involve
It is that balance which has inspired the Commission 's proposals
What we are discussing is a combination of market access and rules
We at the Commission believe that negotiations on services are in the interests of both the industrialised countries and the developing countries , for several reasons
Without access to the high-quality systems provided by insurance , banking , accountancy services , telecommunications , transport and distribution , an economy is no longer competitive today
This applies equally to developed countries and developing countries
Secondly , the European Union has a great deal to gain from these negotiations
Services are the most dynamic sector of the European economy
They represent two-thirds of our gross domestic product and jobs
Do these arguments therefore point to a need for the full liberalisation , or even deregulation or privatisation , of services ?
That is why , in our opinion , the Union was right to choose the WTO as the main framework for opening up the services markets
From this perspective , the World Trade Organisation , which is a multilateral organisation if ever there was one , is thus a useful and necessary safeguard against uncontrolled liberalisation
the negotiations concern trade in services and not the way in which it is regulated in each country
The States retain the freedom to impose any rules they wish and to entrust the management of these services to public or private undertakings
The WTO negotiations have no direct or indirect connection with the decisions on privatisation that particular States might take
each country is free to determine which sectors it intends to open up to international competition and which it wishes to keep closed
I would remind you that , in the WTO , decisions are taken by consensus , with each State having one vote
there is no sectoral reciprocity in these negotiations
The United States , for example , could very well decide to open up the education sector without obliging other States to follow suit in the negotiations
kingly services are excluded from the scope of the discussion
The General Agreement on Trade in Services does not cover services that are not provided on a commercial basis or in competition with other service providers
They can organise the service as a public or private monopoly
They can open up the services market to competing suppliers but restrict access to national companies
They could also , for example , open up the services market to national and foreign suppliers , but without entering into any multilateral GATS commitment
In any case , liberalisation , once accepted , only affects non-discrimination and in no way involves giving up regulatory power
The General Agreement on Services does not , therefore , affect the definition of public service missions , their organisation or their funding
From this point of view , the member States of the WTO retain all their freedom
I feel that , ultimately , we would run the risk of ending up with a more limited list than the Union itself would wish for
I shall now come to the negotiations themselves
What are our objectives ?
In order to be able to achieve these proactive objectives , the Union must present a substantial offer
Naturally , our requests and offers are not just impro@@ vis@@ ation
Since then , the documents that set out our approach to the negotiations have been widely published , in particular on our website
The requests made of the WTO partners , which were tabled last July , cover a number of sectors which have been made public
I would specify that these requests do not seek to dismantle public services or privatise public companies
This offer was designed to safeguard public services fully within the Union , and I shall come back to that before concluding
No new commitments have been proposed in the fields of education and health , and we are not proposing any commitments in the field of audiovisual services
I shall come back to that with my colleague , Mrs Reding
The Commission 's work has mainly been inspired by the comments received in response to a public consultation that began at the end of last autumn
Today 's sitting is proof of this , in addition to the appearances I have also made before the committee to which I report
I have decided to make all our proposals public once they have been finalised
The European Union will be the first member of the World Trade Organisation to take this step
I did this in response to a number of requests , including , moreover , a significant number from this House
I did not do it with regard to the requests addressed to third countries
A quick word about two sectors for which the current proposal does not contain an offer
Having said that , this is a field in which we have significant active interests , and some of our Member States have already pointed this out to us
we are currently at the offer stage
Lastly , let us talk about trade in cultural and audiovisual services and about cultural diversity
Culture and , more specifically , the audiovisual sector , are not excluded from the General Agreement on Trade in Services
It is this freedom of manoeuvre that we used commonly to call ' cultural exception ' and which has been ren@@ amed ' preservation of cultural diversity '
The Commission 's mandate for the negotiations underway consists of preserving political requests in terms of preserving and promoting cultural diversity
En@@ ti@@ rely naturally , we are therefore sticking to our mandate and are not proposing any commitments in the field of audiovisual services in these negotiations
As the promotion of cultural diversity is included in the EC Treaty , it naturally forms part of our trade policy
Some WTO Member States have already made known their expectations in the audiovisual sector
These include the United States , Brazil and Japan
Others , such as India , have also announced active interests without , however , having tabled specific requests
This is not about creating a new form of disguised protectionism which would not convince anyone
The defensive role in this matter is my responsibility
My colleague , Mrs Reding , is responsible for the proactive part and will now update you on our progress
Our ambition is to unite the peoples , not just build a free trade area
In this sense , the Union is one of the major players in a controlled globalisation which meets the expectations of the people
Moreover , the debates underway in the various international forums on cultural diversity clearly demonstrate that Europe is not alone
In this matter , we have allies
I see the response of the Commission and the European Union in the area of cultural diversity as being structured around three main lines
Secondly , the promotion of cultural exchanges which respect cultural diversity at world level , in particular by means of a debate on cooperation policies
It is therefore important that we are present in international forums such as Un@@ es@@ co to discuss cultural diversity and to fight to preserve it
Another aspect is education
The most important thing to remember is that public services are not under threat from GATS
Firstly , the agreement lays down a general provision protecting a large number of public services , specifically services which are provided on neither a commercial nor a competitive basis
Thirdly , even after opting for market access or national treatment , they can qualify their commitments with conditions stipulating the restrictions they will apply under their national legislation
Fourthly and lastly , GATS recognises the States ' right to preserve or introduce regulations , laws or other provisions providing for access to quality services at reasonable prices
This applies to universal service obligations
Let us take as an example an area which concerns us and you particularly , the area of education
The commitments given by the Commission and its Member States at the Uruguay Round only relate to private education
The public education system will therefore remain exactly the same
We examined the requests of the different countries with a view to changing our commitments relating to private education services
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe that the position is clear and precise
I would , however , like to say one more thing
This is precisely the aim of the project ' Erasmus World '
Indeed , although we are protecting our European system within Europe , this European system is open to students from all over the world
The Commissioner rightly points out that this is the most dynamic sector
The European Union is also one of the biggest exporters of services in the world , so it is also an important matter of self-interest
We must provide access to the services markets
Not only in our own interest but also in the interest of developing countries
After all , the development agenda is what the Doha WTO round is about
Commissioner Reding provided a very convincing argument for not making a new proposal for the audio-visual sector
I do not have to go into that in any more detail
I would , however , like to say something about computer@@ -related services
On the one hand , we must naturally ensure that we do not cause a massive brain drain towards the West from countries like India
We must also provide our own training
On the other hand , we must also avoid a situation in which people work under other conditions in the European Union , because this could result in social dumping
I therefore think that it is important to create a good balance , and since September 11 we have naturally also had to look at security aspects
It is of course a good thing that we are doing more to include the environment in this
Sustainability is not just a matter for the West , it is a matter for the whole world
I therefore think that it should also benefit developing countries
Excluding water treatment and distribution for the time being seems to me to be a wise policy
GATS directly affects the interests of many EU citizens , and I appreciate Commissioner Lamy 's efforts to broaden communication and provide more information
Bearing Can@@ cu@@ n in mind , I therefore also hope that the Commissioner will put forward new proposals to make this process even more transparent
How can we now prevent the Iraq question from resulting in serious trade conflicts between the European Union and the United States which may obstruct the results of Can@@ cu@@ n ?
I would like to ask the Commissioner what initiatives she has taken in this area and what results they have produced
In this context , there are of course two essential problems with the United States that have not yet been resolved
I should like to ask the Commissioner what the situation is in this regard
Can we expect something like this from the Americans ?
Then there is the pressure we are under to agree to the American proposals regarding genetically modified food
I think that it is very important to set this issue right and to hear what is happening about it
In an interview with The Wall Street Journal , Commissioner Lamy speaks about the fact that 2003 will be the year in which the WTO must deliver
What does he mean by this , and what can we expect in this regard ?
Commissioner , since your appointment you have adopted a very good habit of consulting and informing the European Parliament , for which we are grateful
We are also grateful for your support for the changes to the Treaty necessary to give us the powers we need in the trade area
You know as well as we do that there are genuine and widespread worries about GATS
So they face the dual interest which you have deline@@ ated
Developing countries have not rejected GATS completely
I would put more emphasis on that than on anything else in our resolution
Before we go any further we want to know - not in a per@@ func@@ tory exercise but in a detailed and comprehensive assessment - what this means
Mr President , the curious thing about the EU position on GATS is that it has become a very defensive position
My group would like to focus on that point
He said that he is responsible for defensive measures whereas Mrs Reding is responsible for proactive measures
I seem to remember , however , that your mandate for Seattle in 1999 included the promotion as well as the preservation of cultural diversity
What is being done to preserve cultural , leisure and sports services ?
That is my first question
My second question is to Commissioner Reding
Since your neighbour , Commissioner Lamy , has made you responsible for the proactive measures , how is that being addressed in the Treaty ?
We are worried , concerned about the future Treaty and what it holds for culture
The commitment to promote cultural diversity is an obligation , you both say , in the Treaty
Nevertheless , we would prefer it to be a more binding obligation , as you , of all people , are aware
We would like Article 151 to be respected and given due importance once again in the future Treaty
We will now move on to another cause for concern on the proactive side of things which may also fall within Mr Lamy 's remit - the international instrument
You were both , like myself , at the professional meeting on the instrument for cultural diversity in France a month or so ago
I know that the issue interests you and I thank you for supporting this project
The feasibility study has been carried out by a Fran@@ co-@@ Canadian group
The matter is very important and a great deal of work has already been done
I am surprised at the lack of interest displayed by my fellow Members
Mr President , I will try not to read any sinister political motivation into that
So , while I am grateful to you for speaking to us tonight , I would like to make clear that this does not constitute any kind of political scrutiny
You have made it clear that you believe that you have gone as far as you can , as Commissioner , to make GATS texts available to us
You tell us that you are trying to be open but that you have limited room for manoeuvre
You went on to say , and I quote , ' the current rules of access allow the European Parliament to fully exercise its task of political control '
Can I ask you whether you still genuinely believe that the current rules are sufficient ?
DG Trade 's press release announcing the EU-@@ GATS offers says they are all about helping developing countries
Let us look at the figures
The EU made 109 requests and received just 27 requests back
Only half of those were from developing countries and just one was from a least developed country
Let us not fool ourselves with the rhetoric that this is favouring the poorest
The figures show that it clearly is not
Mr President , Commissioner , in matters of international trade , as in matters of war and peace , there is a European opinion
That opinion exists , so why are you not taking it into account ?
Why , then , I reiterate , are we going to open this Pandora 's box ?
Mr President , Commissioner , I have heard it said that international trade does not create wealth
In saying that the European Union 's objective is to defend and promote the European social model more effectively , the Commission is almost apologising for giving consumers more choice
You , Commissioner , said that your aim is to establish negotiations in which the collective preferences and values of our society are respected
I believe that the best way to respect the preferences of the European citizens is to open up international trade in the audiovisual sector too
We must let the citizens choose , as in the case of education
I will end , Mr President , by saying that , as regards public utilities , as regards water and other services , too little is being done
Europe has shown that liberalisation is not incompatible with regulating and guaranteeing the quality of the services provided to the citizens
This makes it necessary to anchor this special role played by cultural and audiovisual services in the social and political cohesion of peoples in the relevant laws on contract
It is for this reason that we need a two-@@ phase process in the future
The Commission is to be thanked for setting out the first phase in today 's proposal that GATS should not cover the provision of cultural and audiovisual services
There is a need for us to devise our own international convention , an international instrument of our own , if the future of cultural diversity is to be secured
Ex@@ cell@@ ent work has already been done in this area by the Council of Europe , Un@@ es@@ co and , especially , the Franc@@ oph@@ one Conference
Indeed , GATS does contain provisions on investments too
Furthermore , that raises the question , with regard to both this agreement and the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property , that the WTO might be going beyond its remit
The first point I would like to raise concerns the protection of European public services , for we have witnessed a dangerous shift in recent months
At the beginning , the Commission 's position and statements declared that liberalisation offers would not be made in the field of European public services
Then we said that liberalisation offers would not be made in the areas of health , education and audiovisual services
However , European services , public services , are much more wide-ranging than that
We have already requested that countries such as Tanzania , Mozambique and Bangladesh liberalise their water sectors , for example
I believe we must not put that kind of pressure on the developing countries
The European Union must indeed take the lead in the WTO negotiations about the liberalisation of trade in services and the achievement of a general GATS agreement
These negotiations are certainly more than crucial for Europe
Furthermore , the European Union is currently the biggest importer and the biggest exporter of services in the world
Another reason to take these GATS negotiations in hand is naturally - or unfortunately , I should say - the continuing slowdown of economic growth
Liberalisation means we must also open our borders more to services from third countries and thus contribute to their further development
A moratorium is not a good idea
Bilateral liberalisation is very successful and , most importantly , developing countries frequently request it
Progress has been made in transparency but there is no WTO forum and the European Parliament has only a very limited power of consultation
The battle to defend public services is falling far short of expectations
The threats of disintegration lie within the European Union , where competition policy is inappropriately applied and the specific rules much too weak
Exam@@ ining Mr Lamy 's offers , we see that they are strictly confined to the internal choices of the Member States and the Union
We must not forget the priority of development , and we must not speak in place of the South
Lastly , there is a dreadful imbalance between the rapid rate of liberalisation and the lack of public goods at regional and world level
When will there be an action strategy for the European Union ?
With all due respect , Commissioner , there are still , between confidentiality and absolute transparency , many practicable ways ahead
This is a reproach directed at the Member States and also at the Commission
Commissioner Lamy , you began with a report full of atmosphere , propagandis@@ ing for the European model , and referring to the interest of developing countries
I would have liked it if Parliament , in its resolution , were to have more to say about the developing countries
What you said at the outset about privatisation , though , is not something that this House should accept without dem@@ ur
A chain of consequences follows if you give people what they want
I do not want Brussels to be the venue for a debate on a liberalisation introduced to Europe through a back door called GATS
It is perhaps enough for me to say that it is to you that we owe the distinction between working def@@ en@@ sively and working off@@ en@@ sively
Thank you very much for the report you have put before us today
Mr President , we feel that this debate on the opening of WTO negotiations to liberalise trade in services is extremely patch@@ y
Not all the cards are on the table and the initial contacts have , for the most part , not been transparent
The Commission prides itself on a negotiating mandate dating from 1999 , before Seattle , which is now completely obsolete
The national parliaments have not debated the matter transparently and the European Parliament is being called upon to endorse everything on the basis of a brief statement from the Commission
We are not against all liberalisation in principle , but it must at all times be controlled by the peoples concerned
The people must never be in a position where their hands are tied
Commissioner , on Thursday , in this hem@@ icycle , we are going to debate the closure of major firms due to relocation and the resulting human tragedies
If we want to avoid further human tragedies in the future , we must address problems earlier on in the process
We must start by refra@@ ining now from signing agreements such as the GATS agreement which would tie our hands in the future
Mr President , I wish to support Commissioner Lamy on the far-sighted and important programme he is pursuing
The whole question about the importance of services and opening up service markets is one we are about to address seriously within our own internal market
We do not yet have an internal market for services
I expect we will hear some of the concerns in the debates tonight when we look at our own market
However , it is absolutely right to address broader issues
It is right that we should be leading in this field
One of the most important proposals we have worked on here is the liberalisation of electronic communications , a single framework for a converging sector
It is those electronic communications that are really opening up the way to a global trade in services that we have never seen before
Liberalisation is always going to be difficult
If you accept market disciplines and the opening-up of a market , you must expect re@@ construc@@ tion; you must expect firms to close and look for new possibilities
Surely we are not saying here that we should go back to the days of protectionism ?
We want to look at how markets will evolve
That includes the developing world as well
They realise that having the infrastructure in place is going to open up great opportunities for their own economies and for trade globally
The concept of a cultural industry makes this development more marked
Not only is cultural diversity to be respec@@ ted; it must also be safeguarded
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , the service sector is far and away the most important sector in the European economy
The trade in services in the European Union therefore accounts for more than two-thirds of our gross foreign product and jobs
So trade in services far exceeds trade in goods
Further liberalisation also benefits developing countries , because trade in services promotes the infrastructure , such as telecommunications , and also the financial infrastructure for the trade in goods
Thus GATS also contributes to the Doha round
In my view we must therefore stand four-@@ square behind liberalisation and in particular avoid focusing too much on the exceptions that some of the Member States want to implement
The most important sectors are the transport , tourism , financial and telecommunications service sectors
Au@@ di@@ o-visual services form a relatively small part of the offer
It is therefore ridiculous that Member States who do not want this are denying this Parliament any say because they are afraid of changes to the audio-visual sector
I therefore support my colleague Mr Nic@@ hol@@ as Clegg 's plea for change during the Convention
The proposals also fail to take due account of the way in which social movements have been mobilised on a major scale to protect high-quality public services
The Commission must also call for cultural diversity not only to be preserved , but also promoted , as has already been stressed here on more than one occasion
The role of the World Trade Organization must also be reduced and the United Nations General Assembly must be given a more active role in this field
Commissioner Reding , Commissioner Lamy , I will confine myself to discussing the liberalisation of the water sector
Mr Lamy , you think that more competition will provide the poor with high quality drinking water
I personally dispute your view and I believe that there are more and more of us who do so
Any commercialisation of water will automatically lead to an increase in consumption , for that is precisely how the system works
You say that there is no mention of liberalising the resource in the requests the Union makes to the developing countries
That does not make things any better , for commerci@@ alising water distribution will make it impossible to guarantee proper water management
Moreover , we also know from experience that it is not the poor who benefit from commerci@@ alising water
Bo@@ go@@ ta , Buen@@ os A@@ ires and Jakarta are proof of that
Therefore , let us have the political courage to define water as a public good and exclude it from GATS
According to Un@@ es@@ co , culture comprises all the distinctive spiritual , material , intellectual and emotional features which characterise a society or social group
In addition to the arts and literature , it encompasses ways of life , fundamental human rights , sets of values , traditions and beliefs
The right to culture is a fundamental human right
It is enshrined as such in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights
Culture is not just another commodity
The WTO is not the competent organisation to address this issue , nor has it been given a mandate to do so
We must therefore create a new binding international legal instrument , not just to further and promote cultural diversity but to establish trade rules for cultural goods and services too
Un@@ es@@ co is the body which is best suited for the task
I therefore call for this process to be brought to an end as soon as possible
If it is achieved , it will be only in the teeth of the greatest resistance
Democratic deficits are not a good basis on which to res@@ ha@@ pe markets
This is an extremely controversial issue , primarily due to its own assumptions
And there is another problem closer to home@@ ; few European products travel from one corner of Europe to the other
Mu@@ sic , films and audiovisual products are not travelling from one corner of Europe to the other as much as they should
Such decisions , of course , are party political in nature
I travelled here today by rail from W@@ els in Austri@@ a; this took over seven hours in journey time alone and I was very late arriving here
Last Monday , I sent a letter from Brussels to Austria , and it has still not arrived there
I also believe that this is where a Parliamentary Assembly would be enormously effective in achieving greater transparency and justice in the future
Madam President , Commissioner Reding , Commissioner Lamy , ladies and gentlemen , I believe this is the fourth time we have discussed this issue
Does that mean we are stupid , deaf or stuck in a rut ?
No , I think it is just that the time has come to admit that , quite simply , we do not want the same European project for our citizens
We witness the fight to preserve public services daily
Is cultural exception really sufficient if we only exclude the audiovisual sector ?
No , for we can identify sectors related to education and culture which could prove to be veritable Trojan horses and sabotage our efforts to preserve education and culture
We support the international instrument , but how much progress has been made on it ?
That would , perhaps , be a good indication of your intentions
We must also admit that we do not have the same classification systems at all or the same definitions
You are setting in motion a machine but you are unable to tell us what qualitative benefits it will bring
Forgive us for wondering what use it will be to you in the future
firstly , Commissioner Lamy , you say that health , education , media and culture are not being liberalised
That is correct , but there are other sectors that fall under services of general interest
You do not rule out the liberalisation of energy and water , and the postal , port and pilotage sectors are already ready for liberalisation
Naturally we do not need a WHO list for this; subsidiarity will apply as usual
Secondly , Commissioner Lamy , I find it shocking that there is such an imbalance between the questions from the northern and southern Member States regarding market liberalisation
To do this we need relief funds and development cooperation
Anyway , I am convinced that this has nothing to do with genuine concern for the southern Member States but everything to do with the interests of the water industry
My group therefore requests that we do not adopt the liberalisation of sectors that we do not want to liberalise
Madam President , we should take the position that we do not expect of developing countries what we are not prepared to do ourselves
Finally , the bottom line in terms of protectionism is that we have to protect the rights of citizens , whether they are inside or outside the European Union
Madam President , free trade is basically a good thing
It favours development and democracy , as well as growth leading to greater prosperity
Nevertheless , trade issues always give rise to extensive debate , and there is good cause for having such a debate
The market must not encroach upon the political sphere , and democracy must not be restricted
The requirements of transparency and public scrutiny of documentation are fundamental
No country must be forced into taking particular decisions
Neither the market nor other interests must be able to force a country to implement changes that conflict with its national political ambitions
The developing countries are particularly vulnerable
They would like foreign investment , and dealers in international capital are aware of the fact
The developing countries are therefore in danger of being subjected to pressure and of being forced to yield to unreasonable demands
At the same time , we must be able to require that fundamental union rights be recognised and that the environment not be destroyed and human rights ignored
Madam President , Commissioner , I get the impression that the EU 's way of conducting negotiations is listing to one side
It is one-sided in being guided by economic interests , which is actually out of the question
This leads me to form the impression in my mind that you are actually in violation of Article 6 of the Treaty
The EU must not sto@@ ke up the fight for the blue gold
Briefly , I will turn to Mr van Velzen 's question on universities
No commitments concerning this sector will be given on this occasion
At the Uruguay Round ten years ago , we r@@ ash@@ ly gave a number of commitments on opening up private universities in certain Member States
This time , we will stand firm
There are , indeed , a number of problems concerning implementation of WTO decisions on settling differences
The United States is not moving very quickly to implement these decisions
At this stage , the problem lies with Congress , not with the Administration
Congress has not said it will not proceed with the necessary legislation on this issue
Should it fail to do so however , the WTO has endowed us with the means to focus our minds , to use an English expression
I would now like to turn to the other issue , as outlined by Mrs van Lancker
This is the question of whether we might just be asking too much of certain developing countries on the issue of opening up the services sector
In the first place , I am aware that many developing countries need a competitive services sector
This is a considerable percentage
I am aware that developing countries themselves are calling for the liberalisation of the services sector , particularly in relation to the European Union
Lastly , I do not want us to fall headlong into the trap of what I would call ' euro@@ mor@@ ph@@ ism ' over the issue of public services
In Europe we have an extremely well-developed public services structure
I am one of those who value it highly , although some may disagree with me
I must state clearly that other countries throughout the world , especially some developing countries , do not have the same type of public services provision
At present , these developing countries do not intend and frequently cannot afford to establish public services that , if I may say so , mirror our own
I will let my colleague , Mrs Reding , respond to Mrs Fraisse 's comments
In this regard , I think the distribution of roles is appropriate
I would like to reply specifically to the question concerning sport raised by Mrs Fraisse
In her contribution , Mrs Lucas focused on questions of transparency
Let us be very clear on this issue
The whole House has heard an account of the principles on which the Commission 's approach to these negotiations is based
I have explained these principles on numerous occasions
I can well understand that you may have doubts about how the details of my proposals compare with the broad lines put forward
I can well understand also that you may wish to challenge me on my intentions
Each and every one of you can ask your coordinator whether or not the details of my proposals correspond to what I previously announced
To my knowledge , the coordinators have had this information at their disposal for almost three weeks
Nobody , however , has approached me to say that the detailed proposals do not correspond with what I had previously announced
I am very much relieved as I am not in the habit of acting otherwise
Mrs Lucas , there is , indeed , transparency on this subject
Moreover , this is something the European Parliament itself understands well
For example , Parliament reserves the right to confidentiality in the case of conciliation procedure when negotiations would be at risk
I believe it is right for Parliament to retain this option
As in all negotiations , there is a time for informing the public and a time for discretion
As to the substance , I would refer to Mr Clegg 's comments where the main points are concerned
We have gone well beyond the current provisions on information and transparency of the EC Treaty
If you want to move further ahead , as the Commission does , please support us
I trust that Members ' interventions at the Convention will be as emphatic as those sometimes directed against the Commission
Mr Abitbol and Mr Berthu , I would hope , when it comes down it , that people will not cry wolf too often
If we cry wolf when there is no wolf , we only end up frightening people
There is no wolf here
There is no question of opening a Pandora 's box of any kind
It has not been opened and remains closed
Mr Désir , I completely understand all your reservations
Once again , however , we should not act as if the Pandora 's box of deregulation had been opened
We are not considering the liberalisation of services
We are considering proceeding with opening up trade in services
This has nothing to do with deregulation , liberalisation or privatisation
We should not confuse two completely different debates
On the one hand , we have the debate amongst ourselves within the European Union on the extent of liberalisation of certain sectors that have hitherto been protected
These include energy , transport and postal services
This debate concerns the way we organise our own society
It involves a number of my colleagues within the Commission as well as Parliament and the Council
On the other hand , we have the debate on issues relating to external negotiations
Please do not bring the dock workers into it
To the best of my knowledge , unless I am very much mistaken , the dock workers ' presence relates to a draft directive on the internal market
The dock workers sector is not on the list
They are concerned about the internal market
in no way will it be affected
We will retain our sovereign right to regulate these sectors as we see fit
This matter therefore has nothing to do with the draft directive at issue
I would like to comment briefly on what Mr Herzog had to say
I understand all the feelings expressed
I would now like to turn to the questions concerning the water sector
I recognise these are sensitive issues
I would simply respond by saying that water is outside the remit of GATS
Thus far , no country has given even a minimal commitment concerning the water distribution sector under the General Agreement on Trade in Services
No such commitment has been given by any country
What has happened , or what is happening in a number of countries stems from sovereign decisions that countries have taken on liberalisation or on privatisation
This has nothing to do with international negotiations on services
If many countries , particularly developing ones , have proceeded with cases of independent liberalisation or privatisation , it is for the most part because they needed foreign direct investment
In my opinion , GATS and other similar negotiations allow such countries to attract investment without surrendering their right to regulate
There have been occasions when they have been forced to do so as the result of a reckless approach
In a sense , therefore , this amounts to a form of protection
I would remind the House once again that our proposals for this area relate only to distribution
They do not relate to access to water , as Mr Turmes recognised
I am not surprised by their statements
I do wish to take a harder line on this matter but I believe I should take account of the misgivings expressed in different quarters
In my opinion , these two debates are quite different
Given that these misgivings and concerns do exist , however , we must respond to them patiently and as clearly as possible
The Commission is ready to do just this
There are a number of reasons for this
Firstly , we want to maintain our ability to protect cultural creativity on a regional , national and international level
To this end , we need to have the freedom to support all kinds of cultural products , if that is what we want to call them
Secondly , cultural products are not the same as commercial products
Culture has another dimension
It is linked to our roots and our diversity
As Mrs De Sarnez rightly said , and as I have clearly stated , neither GATS nor the WTO is an appropriate forum in which to debate culture
I therefore agree with all those in this House who have stated that we need an international body like Un@@ es@@ co
Madam President , we need to be aware that , at present , there is no international legal reference standard for culture
I agree with all the Members who stated that one is called for
We need one to pre-empt this never-ending series of debates on culture
We therefore need an international legal reference standard in the interests of cultural diversity and cultural exchange
It is an idea we should work on
It follows logically from the Un@@ es@@ co declaration and we are studying it with interest
Initially , it should foster reflection on indicators of cultural diversity
That said , preserving our ability to support cultural diversity entails , in the first place , action within the European Union
Nevertheless , many Members of this House who have indicated that we need to go further are right
We do have an international responsibility which goes beyond the Europe of Fifteen or Twenty-five
The Treaty now provides for this
Article 151 allows international action where culture is concerned and we regularly engage in this
I can assure you that a film director from a third country could not show his or her film in Europe without an invitation to a European cinema festival
We are most certainly opening up to others
I would like to tell Mr van Velzen that our Erasmus World project is only possible because the Treaty allows us to go beyond the borders of the European Union
Ladies and gentlemen , this must certainly be preserved in the European Convention and in the next Treaty
In the forthcoming Treaty , we must be allowed to retain our ability to protect cultural diversity of all kinds within the Union
We must also be able to retain our ability to act beyond the borders of the Union at international level
This could involve the creation of a Un@@ es@@ co type of international agreement to protect culture , or projects like Erasmus World
It could also involve helping creative people from third countries express themselves in the forums made available to them
You will appreciate that culture necessarily entails opening up
Clearly , this opening up is not merely for the benefit of Europe@@ ans; it also involves welcoming creative artists and others from third countries
I would thank the Commission for these contributions
In connection with this debate , I have accepted six motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure
Despite all these fine words , the European Parliament remains under-@@ informed and , above all , under-@@ consulted
We are unable to exercise parliamentary control
What value do meetings involving confidential documents held behind closed doors have ?
How can we accept this lack of democratic debate where neither national parliaments nor the European Parliament are involved ?
The Commission is relying on a general mandate pre-@@ dating Seattle that has been rendered null and void
It therefore has no legitimate right to impose its decisions
We must ask ourselves why it is so difficult to assess the consequences of liberalisation
Moder@@ nity lies in the ability of governments to guarantee fundamental rights and not in a determination to satisfy the financial markets
I join with more than 150 other French elected representatives in demanding transparency and the suspension of the negotiations in order to prevent an irreversible GATS
The Council at last handed down its common position on 5 November , so that we are now through to the second round
The Council has stated its position , and now , on the basis of the first position , we again have to give our opinion
There are four things I want to say about the 34 amendments that the committee has submitted
First , the committee takes the view that we need unambiguous provisions to establish fair conditions for competition between ports
Madam President , the regulation on state aid that the Commission submitted at the last minute is not adequate , either
There has to be legal certainty for the ports and for the port companies
We have to know which financial arrangements regarding port infrastructure do not constitute subsidies and do not require modification , and which actually are subsidies and need to be approved
It follows that we need clear and binding guidelines
Secondly , we are agreed - in the committee at any rate - that pilot services are to be taken out of the scope of the directive
The Council 's approach is to keep pilot services within the directive 's scope , but then to state that all are free to do as they please
In contrast to that , we favour clear and open regulations
That is something that the Member States should regulate for themselves
The demonstration , and a number of strikes in European ports , were about self-@@ handling , and this is where I am , quite seriously , astonished
After all , we all spent last week in discussions with trade unionists
It was Parliament that , at first reading stage , restricted self-@@ handling to a port 's own staff and equipment
The committee 's report introduces a further restriction - to a ship 's own crew
The unions are striking , and I have no idea why
If they are generally opposed to European regulation of ports , then let them say so
An individual port belongs neither to the people who work in it nor to some state-@@ operated harbour monopoly , nor indeed to the shipping companies
A balance must be found between fair competition and entrepreneurial freedom , and so I can only say that our proposal on self-@@ handling is the right one
Nor can I understand why some are now saying that we have to make all port services subject to a conditional agreement
The Commission has stated that the Member States can require that they be submitted for approval
At first reading stage , Parliament took exactly the same view , as did the Council in its Common Position
We of course want the compensatory payments to be arranged on a mandatory basis , with unambiguous criteria , and so we have no great problems in that regard
We often complain that Europe could use sea transport as an alternative to road transport and land transport in general
We clearly need to improve the efficiency of port services , and that is what this initiative intends to do
In this regard , ladies and gentlemen , I will explain to you the Commission 's position on the proposed amendments
Some of them clearly improve the Council 's Common Position and the Commission therefore accepts them in their entirety , in principle or in part
In other words , the Commission is once again making an effort to ensure that the codecision system works as well as possible
In any event , I will refer later , in particular , to some of the amendments which deal with these aspects
I would once again like to congratulate both Mr Jarzembowski and the Committee on Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism in general for the work they have done
We therefore clearly cannot support Amendments Nos 36 and 66 which call for the Council 's Common Position to be rejected
Having said this , I would like to make a few brief comments on other issues which Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned
I know this is an issue of great concern to the rapporteur and other Members and furthermore I believe that progress must be made on it
That is why I intend to accept those amendments which propose the inclusion of ports in the Commission 's Directive on transparency
The Commission understands the current concern here
In fact , our recent document on this issue demonstrates our will to resolve the problem while respecting , however , the provisions of the Treaty , Mr Jarzembowski
We must clarify this in order , as I said , to prevent legal doubts or uncertainties
And therefore , Mr Jarzembowski , I must say that Amendment No 15 goes further than such provisions and we cannot accept it
We are , however , prepared to try to seek , together with this Parliament , an approach which is acceptable to everybody
Mr Jarzembowski has talked about the practice of self-@@ handling
This practice should be allowed in all modern ports where possible , with regard to both operations on board and those on land
The Common Position reflects this desire to send a message of progress and looking forward rather than rigidity
Those amendments which seriously restrict this approach - since , in various ways , they hinder self-@@ handling operations - restricting them exclusively to seaf@@ aring people , cannot be accepted
Because the additional limitation relating to ships flying the Union flag will bring the Union into confrontation with its partners in the world and that must also be avoided
Finally - briefly - we have always believed that pilotage is a commercial service
Therefore , access to such a service should be regulated by the Treaty and by this directive
In conclusion , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , tomorrow 's vote will have great repercussions on the legislative process
The Commission has always shown itself prepared to seek constructive solutions with the European Parliament
Furthermore , the future European transport system will only succeed with efficient and forward-looking ports
We cannot have one sa@@ u@@ ce for the goose and one for the g@@ ander
We have nothing against these people
In doing so , we did of course listen very carefully to what the industry and interested parties had to say
That is why we stand by our position on pilotage , where idio@@ syn@@ cra@@ sies , different approaches and safety factors have to be taken into account
It is why we take a different view from the Council , a more amicable view if you like , of workers ' demands and the question of self-@@ hand@@ lers
Our focus is on proper staff training , which is why I think that port workers ' current demands on the question of self-@@ handling are somewhat exaggerated
We passed them with a great deal of unanimity , and I think we will get an absolute majority of 314 votes on the decisive points when we vote tomorrow
They have every right to do so , but not , as I see it , to throw stones and get into s@@ cu@@ ff@@ les with the police
The most odious point is the formulation on self-@@ handling , which is also to include what is done on land
Let me say quite clearly that this is , in our view , unacceptable
We take the view that self-@@ handling can mean only those things that can be done by a ship and its company on their own
Anything more than that is not on , as is clear from the term ' self-@@ handling ' itself; anything else would be handling by others
There is no moving beyond that , either here or in the conciliation procedure
I think the committee has done very good work on these things , and the Social Democrats have tabled amendments to make overall improvements
You can vote in favour of all these amendments tomorrow , and then everything will be that little bit better for the workers
As carriers , ships are subject to so many constraints , and face so much competition , that safety often gets left behind
As we have seen from what happened to the Prestige and the Erika , pilots have to answer for the safety of ships
They therefore have nothing to do with this directive
In general - as Mr Jarzembowski has mentioned - we have now devoted a great deal of attention to competition in ports
My main problem continues to be with competition between one port and another , and that is where the Commission has not done enough
We hope the Commission will now present us with something good in this area , so that we can really get to grips with the problem of inter-@@ port competition
Commissioner , access to port services must be as open as possible , and a port must be able to operate as well as possible
This directive is one contribution , but we also need guidelines for government aid and a directive on transparent financial relationships between the port sector and the government
We are also rightly making rules that create a framework for the free circulation of services and we are rightly including specific aspects of ports
That is why we must impose requirements - social requirements too - on anyone wanting to offer services in a port
That is also why we propose introducing compulsory licensing for the provision of services in ports
That will enable aspects such as safety and the environment to be taken into account , as well as social rules and employment
We must therefore know who is working in our ports and under what conditions
That is something we urgently need
Mr President , we have already debated this directive on opening up all port services to competition at the first reading
Everyone has commented on it
The Council subsequently made its position known
We are faced with a liberal directive which , as usual , seeks solely to reduce costs , to the detriment of all other factors
There has been no genuine consultation with unions or others involved , despite the fact that these people are familiar with the safety and environmental requirements and have invaluable know-how
Furthermore , the fact that we are continuing to legislate against those employed in this sector was demonstrated this afternoon through the formidable dock workers ' demonstration
As he said , their protest is legitimate
Considering that their trade and their jobs are being destroyed , we cannot expect them to come to the European institutions bearing flow@@ ers
In addition , no prior assessment has been made of the effects of this liberalisation , especially as regards important issues such as employment , safety and the environment
According to my fellow Member , Mr Hatzidakis , liberalisation is not an aim in itself , but a means of economic development
Well , I am waiting for an evaluation
I want to know the impact of this on other sectors
We have been waiting for a while now
Regardless of the amendments incorporated , the text remains liberal
Whether we like it or not , self-@@ handling at ports will be tantamount to permitting social dumping , despite the various safeguard clauses included
These refer to safety , to the qualifications required of staff and even to the nature of the se@@ ago@@ ing personnel
This directive makes it possible to employ workers from outside the port to do the work of the qualified workers currently employed
The concept of self-@@ handling will result in insecurity , worse working and employment conditions and worse environmental safety standards
This is a particularly retrograde step in light of the current practices of commercial fleets , which have shown that the consequences may be very serious for the European Union
Employees like dock workers fulfil a very important economic role in difficult conditions while maintaining safety standards
Services such as pilotage and mooring services are not covered by this directive , even though they are universally recognised as being services of general interest
I think all these sectors should be considered as partners in the pursuit of sustainable development
Lastly , following the damage caused by the Prestige , I met with professionals from the maritime sector in France to discuss safety issues
They all insisted that maritime safety begins at ports
I therefore feel that the measures taken here after the sinking of the Prestige and the decision taken today to impose self-@@ handling are totally contradictory
These , then , are the reasons why my group will continue to advocate rejection of the common position
In both cases the position of workers may be affected
After the vote tomorrow we will go to arbitration , then we will have another vote and then the European Court awaits , I can assure you of that
Please can we link these two matters
As I see it , the reasons for excluding pilotage services from the scope of the directive apply to all technical nautical services
Quality of service and the safety of operations are part and parcel of all these services
This directive has a single aim
It seeks to establish fair competition , which seems to amount to opening up markets judged to be sufficiently profitable to competition
Although the efficiency and reliability of public services is recognised , this is outweigh@@ ed by the interest , or rather the interests generated from the process
Self-@@ handling provides an example of this liberal vision
Although it now has a better-@@ defined framework , for the most part it ignores the high safety standards currently in place
The dock workers made their discontent clear through their demonstrations in Brussels on Friday and this afternoon in Strasbourg
The demonstrations show how they despair of the European institutions that are out of touch with reality and the concerns of the people of Europe
They can see that the authorities are sticking obstin@@ ately to their dogmatic positions
This is all the more unacceptable when safety is at stake
I am not going to reiterate the points made by some of my fellow Members during the discussions on the previous document
They pointed out the negative repercussions of previous cases of liberalisation , which proved unpopular as they were ill-@@ prepared and imposed
Further to the Erika and Prestige accidents , it is not possible to claim ignorance or maintain that such incidents were highly unlikely
If accidents happen , the European Union and its institutions must act in accordance with their accountability to the citizens of Europe
Mr President , it goes without saying that I am emphatically opposed to the directive in front of us , and particularly the file on self-@@ handling
I wish to emphatically express my complete solidarity with the workers who have come to Strasbourg to demonstrate today
It is their dedication and their professional knowledge that make our ports fast , competitive and in particular safe handling organisations
I would like to know why something that is in fact perfect has to be changed or dismantled
Only a clear ' no ' or ' never ' will do in the face of so much blind European arrogance
working for your own people first is a guarantee of safety and quality
Mr President , it is not for a procedural motion , it is for a personal fact
Then Mr Van@@ hec@@ ke comes along here and b@@ ang@@ s his drum
Mr President , free access to port services is very important for guaranteeing honest competition in ports
Competition between ports is also important , so the Commission must ensure greater transparency in government investments that benefit the ports
The present directive got off to a mess@@ y start , but we now finally have a good document on the table
I would like to say something about two matters
Today and last week , there were dock workers demonstrating outside the Parliament buildings
Their position and social standing is extremely well protected by various articles in the directive , right up to their training and professional qualifications
The employer 's right to know whom he will be working with is , I think , the employer 's right
I therefore do not support Amendment No 13 in which self-@@ handling is again toned down - in a definition , would you believe
The second point of interest is pilotage services
I wholeheartedly endorse the Council 's viewpoint on this matter
In the formulation of the Council , Member States may liberalise their pilotage services if they want to , but they must do so under the directive
I am not in favour of removing pilots from the directive
The common position forms a balanced text which we should not tin@@ ker with too much
The compensation arrangement can , in my opinion , best be arranged between the market parties concerned without outside interference
The text of the common position does far more justice to the great diversity of situations and regulations on this point than the amendments tabled
Commissioner , I must reiterate the position of the French socialists on this document
Consideration of this report began in confusion during the first reading
We are opposed to it for three main reasons
At stake are problems concerning the development of different areas , the North-South balance and congestion problems in the Pas@@ -@@ de-@@ Calais area , in particular
Secondly , although we are in favour of competition , it must have an equitable basis
The Commissioner said a few moments ago that there is a one to three ratio between the prices charged by different European ports
While this is probably true , the main explanation lies in the radically different social conditions in different countries
Without directives on social issues , collective agreements and harmonised statutes , what has happened to road transport for example , will also happen to ports
In other words , competition will not be fair but will entail a level@@ l@@ ing-down of social conditions
The dock workers understand well that we are not implementing competition but a terrible mechanism to reduce prices and salaries
Thirdly , we are completely opposed to the way the concept of self-@@ handling has been introduced
Mr Hatzidakis wondered why we should not liberalise everything now that we have liberalised one sector
He is fully aware that the greatest amount of social malpractice probably takes place in the maritime sector
We fear that self-@@ handling would simply be an excuse for significant social dumping
We would like to pose the following questions
How can we guarantee that national social standards will be complied with when they are all different ?
Who will ensure compliance with social standards ?
How can we ensure that multinational crews , comprising Philip@@ pin@@ os and Malay@@ sians , for example , respect social standards ?
How can we ensure fair competition with the port 's dock workers ?
This is why we propose the common position be rejected
This is doubtless also why the dock workers are demonstrating their discontent
Mr President , with all the commotion outside , the port directive is perhaps more controversial in the second reading than it was during the first debate
We have not finished yet if we are really voting out pilotage services tomorrow
Medi@@ ation with the Council is therefore on the horizon
As a Liberal I am far from happy with the scope
I had wanted more leeway , especially on the point of self-@@ handling
I have a couple of amendments that make it possible for self-@@ hand@@ lers to un@@ load cargo both on the ship and on the qu@@ ay
I think that the unions ' fear about social dumping is nonsense
Sufficient guarantees can be built in
In particular , I find it regrettable that the people at the top are communicating so badly with the rank and file
There is no threat , there are just opportunities
Opportunities to show that they have the most experience , that they can work smoothly and efficiently and that they can therefore offer a keen price
Ultimately , what we are talking about is better quality and more services , but a monopoly must not be allowed to develop
C@@ losing ranks and holding back modernisation will ultimately be at the expense of the working conditions of the dock workers themselves
Mr President , today it has once again become clear how far decision-making in the European Union is from the reality of the people it concerns
In this case , the people are the workers in the ports
Once upon a time there were a lot of them; their work was dirty and dangerous and poorly paid then
By organising themselves they have been able to improve these things and protect themselves against poorly paid , unskilled labour being hi@@ red in from outside by illegal contractors
Y@@ ears ago the European Parliament called for rules governing competition between ports , particularly between ports serving the same hinterland , such as the North Sea
A lot of government money has been squandered on excessively low tariffs and excessively generous facilities to please the shipping companies
The European Commission has now picked up on this , but not with a view to restricting competition between ports but rather to promote it within the ports
This competition is trampling all over the dock workers
That means a return to the old situation
The main aim is to cut labour costs even further
We can expect a large number of disputes about rules being flouted and competition being distorted in years to come
That was not sufficiently clear to the trade unions at the first reading in November 2001
S@@ tri@@ kes against this un@@ reason@@ abl@@ eness are the only weapon the people have left
My country also wants to be able to retain its ' Major Law ' , but that is naturally not what it is about
The Prestige accident has already been mentioned by many people
Are we going to see serious accidents like this in the future when goods are loaded and unloaded ?
The other great risk is that of social dumping on account of self-@@ handling
Commissioner , is that really what you are aiming for , competition through social dumping ?
I do not think that we should go down that route
We must ensure that compulsory licensing is introduced
I therefore really do not agree with what you are advocating , as I am sure that anyone subject to strict licensing laws will also experience distortion of competition
Mr President , today dock@@ workers have demonstrated against this measure outside this Parliament
I had to fight my way through te@@ ar@@ gas to gain access to the building
As a new Member I thought this was possibly normal practice
There has already been a protest in Brussels and there will , no doubt , be many more
However , this directive offends not only against workers ' expectations but also against the dock companies , which have invested heavily in facilities and infrastructure
These proposed rules are throwing their businesses into turmoil
For this reason we voted against the measure at first reading
seeking to make slightly better something that is inherently flawed
If this Parliament truly represented the wishes of the people , it would throw this directive out , but it will not
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I do not agree with the view that Parliament has betra@@ yed the voters in working on this directive
I endorse the proposal for a directive and the balance reached , thanks , not least , to Parliament 's work
I am not against self-@@ handling in principle , but it must not become an excuse for promoting forms of social dumping and ways of econom@@ ising on professional qualification or safety
This is transparent competition
This applies to new ports too , in order to ensure the availability of private investments
I hope that the balance achieved by Parliament can be preserved
Ladies and gentlemen , Commissioner , this afternoon we have seen that our directives do have some effect on the people of Europe
We have , in particular , seen that the dock workers are angry , very angry , and also desperate
Most likely because they are heard too infrequently in this Parliament
In Parliament we should have discarded the proposal immediately after the first reading , we should not have amended it
Various colleagues have already told me that it is not what we wanted
I will continue to fight against this directive , I will vote against it tomorrow and I will continue to do so
Because I still do not understand what its added value is , not even in its amended form , although I do admit that it is much improved
I will tell you why the dock workers are striking , Mr Jarzembowski
I hope that we will be able to vote the proposal out , but I fear that we will not be able to do so
self-@@ handling out and compulsory licensing in
I found out today that we are better at defending this Parliament with a police force than we are at maintaining the social system in Europe
Their levels of efficiency throughout the Union must be improved by agreeing framework conditions for fair competition both between and in ports
The Commission proposal and this compromise we are discussing represent a cautious start to this work
I would like to make a couple of observations regarding the content of the proposal
We could have gone further , taking into account our committee 's insistence on the prevention of social dumping
Nevertheless , this directive is a step in the right direction and Mr Jarzembowski deserves our thanks for working with such perseverance with regard to this difficult issue
Mr President , the competition and race for profits that you wish to introduce into the administration of port facilities are already practised in maritime transport
This has led to ecological disasters involving the Erika and the Prestige and finds expression in the employment of seamen at salaries ten times lower than European salaries
We reject the idea of having dock workers compete with one another on the basis of their status or origins , for that would be to the detriment of everyone
All those who work at ports must benefit from the same conditions of salary and social protection , modelled upon the most advantageous available
I also welcome onto the platform some representatives of the dock workers who have got in
Today I feel a bit like I am in the Middle Ages , in a for@@ ti@@ fied castle
What can I add in a minute ?
Nobody is asking for this
Europe is apparently the crow@@ bar used to tackle problems in some countries
I would like to deal with just one point , namely that of compulsory licensing
As the directive now says , it is being left up to the Member States to decide whether or not to issue a licence
In other words , the Member States and the port authorities are free to decide whether to operate an obligatory system of this kind or not
At the same time , however , we are creating - and I do not understand this , Commissioner - an additional competition-@@ distorting element in this directive itself
It is therefore being left up to the Member States to decide whether or not to do this
If this is the case then I will vote in favour
I support compulsory licensing because I am in favour of the same competitive conditions existing in all ports
Mr President , Commissioner , this directive and this proposal have their own personality
We began with the rapporteur 's positions , which gradually changed and which at the moment are being transformed by Parliament 's vote
I must firstly congratulate the rapporteur on doing his job , which is to defend the position of Parliament and not his initial position
Furthermore , these negotiations have helped us to understand that Parliament must respect the Commission 's exclusive powers of legislative initiative
Some Members have tried to introduce proposals , but this has not been possible , which I believe is positive , because we must all respect everybody else 's role
This directive attempts to open up a European area of transport , which is absolutely essential , because at the moment the State areas are of no use to us
It is true that , at the moment , with the proposals in the directive , we are not talking about reducing the number of jobs in ports
We are talking about increasing the number of workers in ports while making them more efficient
We must also forget the idea that liberalisation and lack of safety go hand in hand
Aviation is a mode of transport in which safety is vital and nobody can claim that its liberalisation reduces safety
Let us not forget , Mr President , that Parliament has made a great effort to bring its position closer to yours
In conciliation you must now reciproc@@ ate in relation to self-@@ loading and pilotage
Mr President , I bring greetings from the Finnish dock@@ workers , who know how to load and un@@ load ships professionally and competently
They send their greetings and say that the proposal now before us should be rejected
If it were to go ahead , st@@ ev@@ ed@@ oring would become ' flag of convenience work '
We have had bitter experiences of flag of convenience vessels flouting terms and conditions of employment and health and safety and environmental protection standards
Under the guise of competition , ship owners are now trying to extend the exploitation of seamen from the se@@ ago@@ ing context to the ports
That cannot be accepted , given that it is being done on the pretence that it increases competition
Both port employers ' and workers ' organisations unanimously agree that competition will not increase with this directive
It is only economic and social dumping that will increase
There are , however , aspects which should not be exclusively regulated by the Union
Mr President , Commissioner , Mr Jarzembowski , European industry needs efficient maritime transport
That particularly applies to the amendment to Article 4
9 whereby the provision that would give industry the option of self-@@ handling using land-based personnel would disappear from the directive
Many people want to achieve this , but extremely few are working towards doing so
One step in the right direction would be to reject all the amendments that limit competition and to support those which really are aimed at promoting it
That is something I hope Parliament will do
That is why it is important for the text adopted to consider each particular port service in its own right
At first reading , I tabled two amendments designed to exclude pilotage and mooring services from the scope of the directive
The House voted in favour of these , and that is something I am delighted about
An opening up to competition would be slightly more acceptable to the relevant services if certain points in the directive , such as self-@@ handling , were to be reworded
Having opted for self-@@ handling , the ship owner must ensure that this is maintained throughout the operation
We must avoid enacting regulations authorising an à la carte system
That is why I would encourage you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of Amendment No 13 , seeking to limit self-@@ handling to se@@ ago@@ ing personnel
I believe it is important that we can hold a debate and that you can present your arguments
Secondly , we have an entirely ideological question
Some of you believe that monopoly is the ideal situation
Ladies and gentlemen , I believe in principle that the option of healthy competition is much better than a situation of monopoly
This is essentially an ideological question
Having said all this , the facts appear to point more to one side than the other
It is true that there are elements , areas , market segments , which , due to a lack of size , do not allow for several operators
But when there is competition things work better
There is a higher quality of service , better prices and better costs , and more competitiveness
Ladies and gentlemen , our air sector , as was said a moment ago , does not appear to have suffered as a result of introducing competition
This Parliament wishes to introduce competition into the rail sector and has voted for that by a majority
Here we are talking about also introducing competition into port services in large ports
Ladies and gentlemen , you say that this puts an end to safety and you link it to the Prestige
What does this have to do with the Prestige ?
It bears no relation
I am sorry , but they are different issues
Furthermore , nobody is asking for a reduction in the safety elements
This is why in the fields of pilotage and mooring services , in all these fields , specific and special precautions are being put in place , including in loading
We are allowing the port authorities to develop this aspect in accordance with their better knowledge of the situation in each European port
That is what I am in fact doing in transport , in the ports , in the other sectors of transport and in energy
That is quite simply what lies behind the Lisbon spirit
In fact , what we are talking about here is a fundamental proposal and what we are proposing is the European model
I will now discuss the second point that has been discussed , which is social dumping
Nobody wants social dumping , ladies and gentlemen
We want more work for more activity in ports and furthermore with adequate social guarantees and conditions
Because , according to the European model , competition is introduced while maintaining social standards and guarantees
That is the European model , which is regulated liberalisation and which is not genuine liberalisation
And that is what we are doing , ladies and gentlemen
I would read two things to the honourable Members
The key is that we are talking about regular personnel
Ladies and gentlemen , please read the way this text has ended up because I believe it is crystal-clear
We do not intend to reduce safety levels , to carry out social dumping , or anything of the kind
Let us see if we can come to an agreement
And we have not as a result reduced safety in European air transport
Let us tell the truth , please
I understand that there has been a protest outside this Parliament
You are politicians , ladies and gentlemen
We must listen to everybody , but let us tell the truth
Nobody is proposing social dumping
On the contrary , we are talking about guaranteeing social standards and requirements relating to employment , and of regular personnel , not temporary personnel
If we restrict it to just seaf@@ aring personnel , we would then , on the contrary , be taking the wrong approach
I believe we also have to consider land-based regular personnel equally
The third element which you have insisted on once again is that of competition between ports
Of course we are dealing here with competition between ports
What we have to ensure is that that competition is not unfair
And in this regard I agree with the honourable Members and the rapporteur , Mr Jarzembowski , in particular
Finally , the issue of timeliness , mentioned by Mr Savary
He said that we should do everything apart from this
But let us not say that we have begun with the ports because that is not true
we are practically ending with the ports
We have a very serious transport problem in Europe and we must seek solutions which are alternatives to road and rail transport , in other words , land-based transport
In an enlarged Europe , in which distances are increased , the maritime sector has many more possibilities and it makes much more sense to create European c@@ abot@@ age
But in order to create European c@@ abot@@ age and for it to genuinely compete with other transport systems , that is land transport , we need efficient port services
That is simply the European model
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
it breaches principles that are enshrined in Portugal 's constitution , which require , at the very least , a prior sounding to be taken of organisations representing workers ,
I would like to stress and express my gratitude for the cooperation of the various rapporteurs - Mrs Rothe , Mr K@@ ronberger and Mr Clegg - which has been excellent
I trust that on Wednesday we will all support this directive
The final text is not the one Parliament would have liked , since at first reading it stated its desire for binding objectives
However , we have shown a significant degree of flexibility in order to bring ourselves closer to the Council 's position and this has taken the form of nine amendments
Commissioner , I congratulate you on this second directive to promote alternative and renewable energies which respect the environment
Establishing these specifications is urgent and inexplic@@ ably the opportunity to do so was missed on the occasion of the recent revision of the aforementioned Directive 98/@@ 70/@@ EC
Everything suggests that we will have to wait until 2005 , when this directive is going to be reviewed , to have clear specifications
I hope that this is not the case and that the problem can be resolved sooner
For as long as these specifications do not exist there will be no quality standards to apply to biofuels
This is a significant vacuum in relation to the quality of marketed fuels
Meanwhile , in the United States , Brazil or South America biofuels are receiving decisive and coordinated support from those governments
The objectives set in the directive are ambitious , but achievable
The action plan proposed by the Commission sets an objective of 20 % alternative fuels by 2020
Some may believe that this is unrealistic , but they also thought this of the directive promoting renewable energy which was approved two years ago
This directive established clear time limits and objectives and continued the support systems
Despite opinions to the contrary , the growth in these forms of energy has been astounding
This directive is forward-looking and will open the door to the development of other fuels and technologies
I have absolutely no doubt that , with will and solidarity , we can create a market for biofuels which ensures that they are competitive in the future
Mr President , I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur , Mrs Ayuso , for the great rigour and care with which she has produced this report
I would also like to thank the members of the Committee on Industry , External Trade , Research and Energy for the serious way they have analysed this report
Furthermore , I would like to thank this Parliament for the support it has been giving to this issue from the outset
With the adoption of this directive we will have specific legislation for combating greenhouse gas emissions in the transport sector as well
Furthermore , the directive provides benefits from the point of view of the security of energy supply and it may eventually lead to the creation of employment in rural areas
The Commission can accept all the amendments proposed , although I would like to comment on Amendment No 2 a little later
Firstly , I will deal with Amendment No 8 , which is the key amendment
Throughout this entire process the Commission has promoted the inclusion of binding objectives
We believe that this would send a very clear message to the industry with regard to the seriousness of our proposal on biofuels
For the first time , the States will have to establish objectives for biofuels
These objectives will have to be based on the provisions of the direc@@ tive; that is , 2 % in 2005 and 5
75 % in 2010 , which represents an increase in the overall use of fuels in each of the countries
This clearly represents a very significant but realistic increase - as the rapporteur said earlier
However , we accept that equally valid reasons may still arise for the establishment of lesser objectives
The Commission is firmly convinced that any other criterion used by the States to justify different objectives must be equivalent to the those laid down in the directive
Finally , I will mention Amendment No 2
Within this context , Amendment No 2 proposes stressing , in particular , volatility parameters
However , there are various parameters in relation to rules for fuels and in this regard we believe that perhaps the amendment should say ' including volatility parameters '
We can therefore accept this amendment in principle but with this modification
Mr President , I would first of all like to congratulate Mrs Ayuso González on the efforts she has made to achieve this successful outcome of a compromise
Even if she is not wholly satisfied with it , I think she has done a splendid job
By developing biofuels and other renewable energies we are contributing to increased security of supply
In my constituency in Scotland , we have the materials and the know-how to be able to develop this industry and are eager to put these proposals into action
We are also hoping to improve our environment with better air quality and a reduction in greenhouse gases
In the bl@@ ending of biofuels into conventional transport fuel we can introduce these changes in a simple way that will not require vehicles or filling stations to be adapted
Biofuels also promise to create new jobs in rural communities through crop production and in the construction and operation of processing plants
This will provide a well-@@ needed boost to the flag@@ ging rural economies
But biofuels remain uncompetitive without significant government tax breaks
A 50 % reduction in tax to match conventional fuel prices will mean sub@@ tracting a hefty ch@@ unk from Member State ex@@ chequ@@ ers
How many of our governments are prepared to lose this revenue ?
We may also see higher inputs of chemical fertilisers and pesticides
Member States must decide to promote biofuels that give an overall cost-effective benefit to the environment
Most importantly we must also invest in research to improve the cost effectiveness and environmental benefits of biofuel crops in the future
I think that here too , on the issue of biofuels , Parliament is continuing to honour its cross-party commitment to promote renewable energies
It is good to know that in our efforts to do so we can usually count on the Commission 's support
At the first reading , Parliament came out in favour of binding targets for increasing the use of biofuels
As with the directive on promoting electricity generation from renewable energy sources , this did not stand a chance in the Council
The Council 's intention to give the Member States a whole series of opportunities for setting their national targets at levels which diverge from the prescribed 5
75 % by 2010 is unacceptable
To achieve this it is not only targets that we ne@@ ed; it is also crucial that the Member States should be able to give tax breaks to biofuels
I very much hope that the new European constitution will make such a situation impossible in the future
We are now taking the first step in the right direction , although the use of biofuels must be promoted far more vigorously from here on in
I think the targets should be binding , which is what Parliament insisted on at first reading
Parliament 's position also took account of the different circumstances that exist in the Member States by making it possible to have temporary derogations
This time we shall not get any further ahead
The compromise amendments are satisfactory
Many factors speak in favour of increased use of biofuels
Firstly , by promoting their use we reduce the need for imported energy and hence the EU 's dependence on external energy production , and especially oil imports
Secondly , biofuels are a renewable energy source and therefore a much better option in terms of the environment than petroleum products
I also regard as very important the point of view that biofuels are a means of boosting employment
That means new opportunities for farms and also where agricultural competitiveness is facing huge difficulties in the more traditional areas
Mr President , I support the action plan of the European Commission , which seeks to promote the greater use of alternative fuels in Europe between now and 2010
Firstly , biofuels help to reduce over-@@ dependence on oil@@ -based fuels , which is a cause for concern as regards both the environment and security of supply
Secondly , biofuels are environmentally friendly and they emit between 40 and 80 % fewer greenhouse gases than fossil fuels
Biofuels are in many cases manufactured from organic waste
This makes it possible to use waste materials , which would normally be thrown away , in order to produce energy
Biofuels offer new sources of income for European industries
We must take advantage of the job opportunities which could be created in research and technological activity
There is clearly a divergence of opinion between the Council and the European Parliament as to whether mandatory targets should be set for the use of biofuels in Europe
We must do all in our power to bring about the greater use of biofuels
The economic and environment benefits are obvious
Biofuels must be introduced , targets met and the work of Member States ' governments strictly monitored and evaluated
European governments should radically change tax systems to encourage European industries to invest more in the biofuel industry
It is not only the present generation which will benefit from these new changes , but also future generations
I wish to compliment Mrs Ayuso González on her excellent report
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I should first like to thank Mrs Ayuso González for her hard work as rapporteur for this directive
In addition , such an initiative meets the requirement of sustainability , which is so important from the point of view of protecting the environment
Finally , I have to note that unfortunately the final paper contains too few incentives for a more efficient use of biofuels
Once again the discrepancies between the interests of the fossil fuel industry and farming are clear for all to see
Mr President , Commissioner , energy and the environment are two of the EU 's most important challenges
Both these challenges are placed before us when we talk about biofuels and alternatives
Measures to reduce the impact upon the climate and to increase the security of supply are important
The transport sector is one of the most important areas when it comes to the long-term security of supply
This is strongly linked to environmental work , but the transport sector is also important to economic development and the possibility of growth
Fuel alternatives are extremely welcome
The use of biofuel may contribute to a reduction in the use of existing fossil fuels and to developments being steered in the right direction
The ' right direction ' means reducing the effect upon the environment
Alternative fuels , including biofuel , must be introduced in a cost-effective way
The objective of sustainable development must be our prime concern , and we must act with a view to the long term
New technology is being developed constantly
Today 's new technology will be old-fashioned and ineffective tomorrow
Through the decision we take today , we must avoid making future technological development more difficult than necessary
We should instead behave in such a way as to facilitate future leaps in technology without ignoring safety or sustainable development
As I said before , the decision we make must reflect long-term thinking
Trade and industry need stable basic conditions if managers are to feel confident about their assessments for the purposes of investment
It must be possible to write off new plant in a manner commensurate with the timescales for technological development and with the costs of new plant
It is also important for the individual Member State to be able to decide what form of biofuel is most suitable on the basis of the fundamental conditions that prevail
The directive is especially important because developments in this very area of transport up till now have been absolutely pitiful
My colleague , Mrs Ayuso González , has really done an excellent job
Transport accounts for more than 30 % of the end use of energy in the Community and that figure is growing all the time
This trend will become stronger still and there will therefore be an increase in carbon dioxide emissions
This increase will be still greater in the candidate countries , relatively speaking
This is why the White Paper is calling for less dependence on oil by the transport sector , for ecological reasons
This is currently at a rate of 98 % and would be reduced by using alternative bio@@ fuel-@@ like fuels
Promoting the use of biofuels in keeping with sustainable farming and forestry practices will create new opportunities for sustainable rural development
This could play a part in the creation of new jobs in rural areas
Moreover , it will be possible to obtain by-products , which , owing to their vegetable protein-rich content , could be used as animal feed
Grow@@ ing plants for biofuel production would have to be combined with current programmes for cultivation , adhering to the principle of crop rotation
The timetable approved by the Council only contains two targets with binding dates
Mr President , Madam Vice-President of the Commission , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to echo the numerous words of thanks to the rapporteur , Mrs Ayuso González
She has negotiated really very energetically and with great skill in this field
I should also like to thank the Commissioner once more for tabling an ambitious proposal
The advantages of extending the use of renewable raw materials to the transport sector have already been mentioned many times
They include cutting emissions , reducing our dependence on oil and above all creating more jobs in farming and rural areas
I think it is right that we need to take into account the environmental impact of biofuels , but we must not be one-sided
I might simply remind you of the tanker disasters that we have had in recent years
We want to promote innovation in this sector
That is why Mr Purvis was right to say that efficient and environmentally friendly fuels must be given particular support
I would add that the first step is to start promoting them at all
I fully endorse the criticism of the Council , as expressed by Mrs Rothe among others
It is important because , as Mrs Rothe has said , it is not sufficient simply to state principles
It is not sufficient to say that 12 % of our energy must be renewable
We must take measures so that that becomes the case
I confess that when I make a promise I like to fulfil it
The promise had been made by others
I believe this is an extremely important measure , together with the provision on green electricity
The debate is closed
The vote will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , it is a pity that Mr Stevenson is not here
As you know , stocks of cod in several areas are in a quite disastrous state
Since the year 2000 , the situation has dramatically worsened and the stocks are threatened with collapse
IS@@ IS , the international scientific body , has advised closing cod , wh@@ iting and had@@ dock fisheries for the duration of this year
This , it is thought , would be the safest way to rescue our cod stocks
However , such a drastic measure does not take account of the massive economic and social consequences that this would have on the entire sector
That is why a sustainable plan needs to incorporate all three dimensions of sustainability and that includes above all the economic and social consequences
We therefore tabled an improved recovery plan to our technical and scientific committee as an alternative to a moratorium
It issued a favourable opinion
We then tabled this improved plan to the Council
In December 2002 , however , the Council was only able to agree on a transitional recovery plan
I should like to stress , however , that this transitional plan is very positive because it already contains substantially reduced quotas , low fishing effort and improved monitoring mechanisms
At the same time it was agreed that the Commission would make two new proposals for the long-term recovery of cod and hake in the spring
We will be tabling these proposals in April , and this week a hearing is taking place with the fishing sector and scientists from all of the Member States
I myself opened this hearing just this morning
Obviously the long-term plan to rescue cod will be designed in such a way as to also make an appropriate contribution to stock recovery
I am aware that this plan will have severe consequences for fishermen in the short term
I can only urgently call on the Member States to take their responsibilities seriously and provide more funds in their programmes for measures of this kind
Belgium has set aside EUR 800 000 , Denmark EUR 1
On the other hand , the United Kingdom , Ireland and Germany have not programmed any measures of this kind at all
Unfortunately , however , the Commission has not yet received any positive signal , either from the Council or Parliament , that the budgetary authority would accept such a proposal
Turning now to your demand for the creation of regional advisory fora , I fully agree with this proposal
I would explicitly call on the Member States to take the initiative here so that regional bodies of this kind can be set up as soon as possible
the Commission fully supports this request
Under these new regulations , which came into effect on 1 February this year , savage quota cuts have been linked to draconian limits on fishing effort
We are literally asking our fishermen to burn their boats
Scotland , where there are only 162 dedicated boats left in what used to be Europe 's biggest whit@@ ef@@ ish fleet , will bear the brunt of these cuts
If we scrap another 20 % , the fleet will fall below the critical mass needed to sustain jobs in our harbours , ports and processing factories
The industry will go into free fall
In addition , the majority of the remaining vessels will be ones that , because they are under 10 years old , are not eligible for decommissioning subsidy
These are the vessels on which the future of our whit@@ ef@@ ish fleet relies
Sadly , however , these are also the vessels with the biggest outstanding debts to the banks
It would not surprise me if many of them were forced into bankruptcy
But Scotland is not the only country affected by these draconian measures
Ireland , Denmark , Belgium , the Netherlands and France have all suffered cuts
The resolution also calls for the allocation of an additional EUR 150 million to compensate fish@@ ers , processors and ancillary workers affected by these conservation measures
I would suggest that EUR 48 million should be used for transitional funding to compensate fishermen and ancillary workers affected by the 15-@@ day@@ s-@@ at-@@ sea fishing limits
I would hope that this aid could be found from the flexibility instrument
These lights represent information be@@ amed from the satell@@ it@@ e-@@ tracking systems
One by one the lights went out , signi@@ fying in a dramatic way the fate that awaits Scotland 's whit@@ ef@@ ish vessels
I hope the House will agree to provide this urgent and desperately needed support
Our fishing communities are crying out for help
Please heed their call
Fishing is an economic activity
Sometimes we worry more about fish than about fishermen and we have to deal with both
It is true that it is an economic activity that involves a natural resource which must be protected
And when these measures are taken in this way , the sector itself will accept them better
Furthermore , we must lay down accompanying socio-economic measures in order to alleviate their possible consequences
These are drastic measures but far short of the all-out moratorium recommended to the Commission by its scientific advisors on fish stocks , IS@@ IS
United Kingdom and Scottish ministers have been attacked for agreeing to the hard-@@ fought compromise
At the time one of the fishing leaders commented that he doubted that the Ar@@ change@@ l Gab@@ ri@@ el could have got a better deal in the circumstances
Inevitably such actions have a socio-economic impact on the communities that depend on fishing for whit@@ ef@@ ish - especially cod
I give my personal support to the resolution before us this evening
I also welcome the GBP 50 million compensation package approved by the Scottish Parliament last week and the related compensation packages in England , Wales and Northern Ireland
It is significant that we are discussing this issue as vital talks take place today and tomorrow in Brussels
Scottish and UK fishermen have joined fellow fishermen and civil servants from other EU countries at the European Commission 's Fisheries Advisory Committee
Talks will focus on a long-term cod recovery plan
I am delighted that the Fisheries Commissioner , Mr Fischler , will bring forward amendments to the current restrictions which have proved to be ' too rigid '
However , the negotiations on the long-term recovery plan will be tough
We really have to think carefully about the right road to take
I want us to examine all possible options on effort control
Saying ' so@@ d the cod ' , allowing fishing to continue and hoping for the best is hardly an option , nor is renationalising the CFP
This duc@@ ks the difficult issues posed by the need for stock recovery
We really need to rationalise the CFP and cod recovery
We must work in a cooperative manner with industry , ministers and other organisations to seek a common solution
We must also create regional committees , allowing decisions to be taken as close to those affected as possible
Doing nothing in the light of declining cod stocks is not an option
The difficult task of arriving at a quota figure that is sustainable , yet scientifically credible , remains
Sadly , we who represent fishing communities around the North Sea - certainly those of us from Scotland - do not need to use our imag@@ inations
We can already feel the effects
Of course assistance with restructuring can be given from within Member States
As Mrs Stihler has already said , the Scottish Executive has managed to find GBP 50 million from its already restricted budget
That is a measure of the seriousness of the situation
But I believe that the EU too must shoulder some of the financial responsibility
This is in part because past shortcomings of the CFP have contributed to the crisis
I hope that the EU counts itself as such a democracy and that this principle will be fully expressed in the forthcoming vote
Mr President , just this once I shall resist the temptation to lamb@@ ast the Commission and the Council for their contributions to the crisis facing the whit@@ ef@@ ish sector in Scotland
I can assure fellow Members that there certainly is a major crisis of confidence in the European Union 's ability to manage fisheries at all
It is predicted that the long-term recovery plan will continue to inflict real economic and social hardship
My preference would be to aim for the use of the flexibility instrument for this
I call upon the UK Government to abandon its previous resistance to taking part in such a process
It is imperative that we learn lessons from the Canadian experience , which we need to examine very carefully indeed
The moratorium introduced in the North Atlantic twelve years ago has not , I regret to say , had the expected effect
The cessation of fishing has had no effect upon the state of cod stocks off New@@ found@@ land and Nov@@ a Sco@@ tia and in the Gulf of Saint Law@@ rence
Forty thousand jobs have been destroyed but , for all that , there has been no re@@ stocking
The Canad@@ ians now recognise that fishing is just one factor among others in the development of cod stocks
It would also seem that , in Canada , fishermen have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation and management of re@@ stocking plans
Mr President , it is very sad that we are having this debate tonight and that we need to give GBP 150 million in funding to help the fishing industry
It is because of the failure of the common fisheries policy that we are having to provide this money
We should also look at industrial fishing - and I know there are mixed views about this - in which sand eels are extracted from the sea bed
S@@ and eels are part of the food chain of the cod and these things are all linked
The process of having quotas for fish and throwing healthy fish over@@ board over the years has also contributed greatly to the position we are in
I strongly support the resolution to provide GBP 150 million of additional funding
I would urge the UK Government to take this up and use it in a very efficient way
I would urge Commissioner Fischler to look at the way this money can be spent
If we offer people money and they cannot then obtain it , they will only end up more frustrated than they were before
I urge everybody to support this
Mr President , Commissioner , I am able to say straight away that I support the resolution
There can be no doubt that there must be a balance in the marine environment
There must be a balance in the stocks
Clearly , such dramatic decisions can , however , be damaging to the regions and to those communities that depend upon fisheries and the industry surrounding fisheries
The EU must therefore intervene and raise some of these problems
Price mechanisms and tariff barriers mean that the prices for these raw materials are very much higher than the prices for the same raw materials on the world market
I do not believe that any of the lab@@ oured arguments we have heard in Parliament are of any help
Clearly , it is the fishing effort that matters
That this is a disaster is a matter of actual fact
We have our hands tied , which is enormously frustrating
I really want to question the way in which the Commission is acting in this matter
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , may I first say as an aside that , with all due respect , you cannot blame the weather for everything
The basis for this work is of course the current budget for 2003 , a prominent feature of which is the reform of the CFP and its requirements
Gener@@ ous interpretation of the rules on flexibility and the reserve , as was still possible in the case of Morocco , is no longer an option
Their policy - the policy of the Member States - is also in need of reform
However we here in Parliament need to help the fishermen today
We all know that in the peripheral areas of our prosperous EU there is usually no alternative work available
We , the EU , are a community based on solidarity and we have to help
Please take note
Mr President , the fisheries industry in crisis - we have heard it all before
But this time it is extremely serious
That was done in a cooperative way
No doubt they will cooperate again in the future , if such closures happen
But what is the future to be ?
It certainly looks very bleak at present for those fishing communities
As to that future , I have no doubt that the industry must be involved in the decision-making process
This has been one of the weaknesses down the years , for as long as I can remember
The scientists blame the fishermen , the fishermen blame the scientists and we try to find a way through
High-@@ wire negotiations only lead to mistrust
I was in Brussels , along with Mr Stevenson , when the negotiations took place last December
The way they were conducted was no way for us to conduct such important negotiations
I hope you will bear that in mind and make sure it does not happen again
I appeal for the stakeholders in the industry to be consulted in a meaningful way , not with platitudes
Their views should not be overlooked in any way
We are discussing people 's livelihoods , their way of life , indeed their very existence
It is precisely the reverse
We anticipated the 20 % decommissioning - before it had actually happened - and did our calculations as if it had already taken place
On that basis we stipulated 15 days at sea , and so no further cuts are now going to be made
Secondly , it is news to me that the majority of the fishing fleet in the United Kingdom now consists of vessels that are under ten years old
Thirdly , as I see it we have to draw a distinction
On the one hand , there are measures that need to be taken to rescue cod and the recovery plan has to be based on these
There is no way round this
On the other hand , we have to show sympathy for the social consequences that this is going to have over a particular period , for an interim period
There too we have to show understanding and help the fishermen
If we are only half-hearted in both respects then it will be completely counter-productive
If we only take half measures then we will not be able to bring about stock recovery and this will do huge damage to our fishermen in the long term
Consid@@ erably more fishermen will be faced with having to scrap their vessels because they will not be able to fish any more
I should also like to point out that the Commission is monitoring the sand eel or industrial fishing issue with very great care
In the past we have asked IS@@ IS to investigate this matter in detail
I think it is only right to set the record straight with regard to Mrs Stihler 's comments too
This money is however coming entirely from national sources and has been declared as a national subsidy
if you demand more money here then this decision has to be made first and foremost , if not in full , by the budgetary authority
Mr President , I would like to ask a question
You see , we also have to be able to give help spontaneously
Is this something that the Commission might also consider ?
Mr President , Mrs Langenhagen , I am quite happy to reflect on these matters in more detail with the Committee on Fisheries
proposals will also be made to Parliament for additional recovery plans
But as I have said , this is certainly something that it will be worth discussing in more detail and I am happy to do so
Perhaps we might also have an informal debate on this in the Committee on Fisheries , say on the basis of a non-@@ paper of some kind
At the end of this debate , I have received a proposal for a resolution on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries
The vote on this resolution will take place on Wednesday at 12 noon
I declare the 2002-@@ 2003 annual session closed
I would remind you that , pursuant to the provisions of the Treaty , the European Parliament will meet tomorrow , Tuesday 11 March 2003 , at 9 a
( The sitting was closed at 10
I declare open the 2003-@@ 2004 session of the European Parliament
( The sitting was opened at 9
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I am one of several Basque Members of this House
I am also fully committed to the defence of all human rights , especially the most basic right of all , namely the right to life
As some honourable Members will be aware , Dom@@ ing@@ o D@@ ur@@ án , an officer in the Spanish national police force died last Friday at the age of 51
Eight years ago he was guarding a Bilbao office processing national identity cards and lost the use of all four lim@@ bs as a result of an attack by ETA
Mr Cox , I believe it would be appropriate for you to issue a condemnation of violence of any kind in your capacity as President of the European Parliament
I thank you for raising that very serious point this morning
On behalf of Parliament I convey our condolences to the family and colleagues of the dece@@ ased and also our outrage at this act
I expect you are aware that the president of this movement is none other than O@@ sw@@ al@@ do Pay@@ á , the winner of the 2002 Sakharov prize
I would therefore urge you to take up the case of these people , Mr President
The debate on the state of the Union is an established item on our agenda
It gives us the chance to look at progress in the year just ended and our objectives for the current year
This year , the debate falls at a particularly sensitive time in terms of both international affairs and the life of the Union
The Iraq crisis , enlargement and the Convention weigh so heavily on our minds and hearts that there is no need for me to mention them
Let me start with enlargement today
Last December , we wound up accession negotiations with ten countries
Ten countries we should now call ' acceding ' , not ' candidate ' countries
Meanwhile , negotiations are going ahead with Bulgaria and Romania so that they can join shortly afterwards and , with the necessary adjustments , joint work is continuing with Turkey
In this regard , before you all , I want to express my thanks to the Commission staff and Commissioner Verheugen for their dedication and their hard work
The Union 's task , however , in the area of enlargement does not end with the decision taken at Copenhagen
Indeed , Croatia 's recent application shows that another region of Europe is knocking at our door
Here I refer to the western Balkans
I want to make it quite clear that the unification of Europe cannot be regarded as complete until the Balkan countries are members of the Union too
After years of uncertainty , democratic debate in both the old and the new Member countries of the Union will now be on firm ground
The very positive outcome of the referendum in Malta is an auspicious sign and an incentive to even greater efforts
The first job is to complete economic integration
The current 15 Member States can and must do much more to promote growth and employment and to reduce disparities
It is the future Members , however , those that are to join next year and those that will join a little later , which warrant the greatest attention
Our shared goal must be to foster sustained growth , strengthen cohesion , step up environmental protection , reduce disparities and , ultimately , encourage all to adopt the euro
Broadly speaking , those are the main points of our economic integration project
While this is our first priority , the second task is to advance the political debate , and that is equally important
It is time we had an in-depth , honest , completely transparent debate on the type of Europe we want to build together
The very success of our integration has already made it unavoidable
The Iraq crisis and the state of international relations mean we can put it off no longer
The possibility of war in Iraq deeply stirs the feelings of Europeans because reconciliation and peace lie at the very foundations of the European Union
In this situation , we have to guard against two temp@@ tations
One temptation would be to build a Europe that is in opposition to the United States
This crisis is marked by widely diver@@ ging views on the instruments to be used
The second temptation we must guard against is focusing solely on the dissen@@ sion within the Union
Di@@ ffering views have clearly emerged among both the 15 Member States and the future Members in recent weeks
However , as the extraordinary meeting of the European Council of 17 February rightly pointed out , we are all agreed on a large number of fundamental points
We all want the UN to remain the cornerstone of world order
We all support the Security Council in carrying out its duties
We all believe that war is not inevitable but , at the same time , we think that Iraq must be made to face up to its responsibilities
That said , we must confront our weaknesses head on
The mechanisms for this are clearly inadequate , but does this mean we have to wr@@ ing our hands and conclude that the objective of joint action is unachievable ?
Our imagination and our determination must be equal to the challenge
Giving in is absolutely out of the question
The questions before us , which we have to answer , are both difficult and crucial
What kind of Europe do we want ?
What guideline are we following ?
I personally cannot be content with a ' supermarket ' , or some sort of large Single Market
Do we not want to build a genuine political area that allows us to affirm and defend our principles and our values throughout the world ?
European public opinion is remarkably clear about what it wants
The regular Eurobarometer surveys carried out by the Commission reveal that our citizens , in particular , want the Union to ensure their security , both at home and abroad
This afternoon , to step up our commitment in the defence sector , the College will adopt a Communication strengthening the European defence industry
This is a sign that the peoples of Europe are moving closer together , a sign which pre@@ figures and anticipates the reform of the European institutions and procedures
We must not be afraid of an open debate , for it is only through dialogue that possible solutions can emerge
This brings me to the Convention
I have always believed that our mission was to bring about enlargement and reform of the institutions in parallel
The requirement of unanimity actually causes paralysis , as we have seen in recent days
This is already the case now and will be even more of a problem in the enlarged Union we have decided to build
This is another reason why we need an open political debate on the new enlarged Europe
Only if we have devised a common project will we be ready to fully accept the basic rule of every democratic institution , which is majority voting
Ladies and gentlemen , today 's annual policy strategy debate will define the political horizons and resource framework for 2004
It kic@@ ks off a process that will end with the adoption of the budget and the presentation of the legislative work programme for next year
Throughout this process , we shall be engaged in an intense detailed debate with Parliament and the Council in order to define the fundamental political options
I would stress that the work of the Parliamentary committees will be of crucial importance here , in particular
A new element in the strategy for next year is the 2004 - 2006 multiannual programme that is to be approved by the European Council , a completely new departure
Indeed , next year , our efforts will focus on enlargement , growth and internal and external security
I am referring to the band of countries stretching from Russia and Ukraine to Morocco
Only in a wider area of stability and prosperity can Europe deal safely with the sometimes disturbing developments on the world stage and fully exploit the opportunities offered by globalisation
The medium-term political programme preparing the forthcoming Financial Perspective will play a key role here
Then , we will prepare the relevant legislative proposals so that they are ready for adoption towards the middle of next year
We have completed the enlargement negotiations
Now we must define the political project for the enlarged Union
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as we have seen today , the Union is a Union on a journey
A Union that must draw on present experience to grow stronger , so that it can assert its identity and its role in the world more decisively
The current crisis must serve as an incentive for us to speed up the reform process which is underway
This process is necessary irrespective of enlargement , but enlargement and the present international context make it even more imperative and urgent
Today , we have a chance to reinvigorate our unity
Our fellow citizens are calling for this and events leave us no choice
let us all strive to make it a success
Together , we can and must lay the political and financial foundations to complement the institutional basis and open this new chapter
Mr President , first of all , the PPE-DE Group appreciates the documents which the Commission has put in front of us this morning
It is an historic and unique occasion
This is the first time in our history where we have had the opportunity to debate budget guidelines with policy documents at the same time
So now we can see how we begin to fit the priorities to the resources available
It is a pity that the Council is not with us because it too could have been part of this debate
I shall start with the broad document which has been produced by the Commission this morning
First I shall deal with the substance
But in terms of the external side , the working group does not cover what the external dimension of the Union should be
We have asked for a report
Indeed , we included in the budget for this year - 2003 - a request to have a document drawn up
When one asks the question , ' what should be the strategic priorities for the Union in the external field to 2007 ? ' a dea@@ thly silence descen@@ ds
In this context there is one specific question I would like to ask the President of the Commission
Does that mean that the financial perspective would be to 2010 instead of 2013 ?
The PPE-DE Group is in favour of the financial perspective covering a five-year period
I would like some clarity on that point
While talking about the Commission , Mr President , you mentioned the Convention
When we envisage a post-2006 Union with 500 million people or more , how will it be possible to run a Union with fewer Commissioners than we have today ?
There seems to be this refrain across the House at the moment that we should have 10 to 12 Commissioners
We are dealing here with the Union , a much bigger enterprise , so why not have 30 or 35 Commissioners ?
It seems to me quite normal that we should do so in the context of the Union of tomorrow
Secondly , the priorities of the budget for 2004 are well set out in the annual policy strategy document in terms of the three points that are made
Concerning sustainable growth , it makes sense to have better integration of environmental concerns
In addition , the PPE-DE Group is interested in the document concerning a better relationship with our neighbours in terms of security and stability
Finally , I come to my group 's priorities during the budgetary process
We remain faithful to what has guided us in the last few budgets in terms of three particular elements which are important to us
This is where the Commission started out
We would like to ensure that this reform is completed by the end of our mandate
We still find irrit@@ ations here
Yesterday mention was made of a document which was quoted partially in the press about the ongoing affair of the chief accountant who has been suspended
We would like to see that document
It is not so secret - most Members , including myself , have a copy
Why is there this fear , this wish to keep secret a document that is already half-@@ known ?
We would like to see that document as soon as possible
Secondly , there is the question of the A-30 subsidy lines - a specific , but very sensitive point for Parliament
We would like to be clear on what the Commission will be proposing in terms of these subsidies for particular institutions
We have differing views across Parliament as to what should and should not be bench@@ marked and we need a common approach on that
My last comment pertains to a letter I have from the Secretary-General about follow-up to parliamentary acts
Here we find that at least 25 % or 30 % of reports that we ask for in this House are never produced
I conclude by saying that this is a key moment in this budgetary process
The Commission has set out some useful lines of discussion and debate looking ahead post-@@ 2004
I hope that at the end of the process our Parliament will be able to reach the right conclusions in the interests of our citizens
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , we are presented here today with a highly technocratic document and a speech by you , Mr Prodi
I would not want to deny that the speech , being political , is more to my taste
What I would like to do is to try and bridge the gulf between the two elements
The threat of war in Iraq has opened new fault lines within the European Union and also within the candidate countries
This means that we have to take a rather more critical approach to things
Let me start with what enlargement is intended to achieve
It is indeed the case that we have to see to it that enlargement ends up being a success
Nor is it an ar@@ te@@ fact that exists only to be used as a justification when unpleasant but necessary reform measures have to be taken
President Prodi mentioned the International Criminal Court
That was a mistake and a failure
Perhaps we are paying the price for what was sometimes a too legalistic and narrow view of the acquis communautaire
Let me now deal with stability in and around Europe
Here too , I believe , we have to take a rather broader and deeper view of the individual regions and shape relationships along appropriate lines
We must concede , though , that our visa policy as regards these countries - to which I travel very frequently - is l@@ ous@@ y
We must of course have a restrictive visa policy , but these social groups could receive flexible treatment under it
I admit that this is a very vague concept , but it is one that already means a number of things to me
I simply ask myself whether we really do have a coherent policy for growth
We invest too little - not only in research and development , but also in infrastructure
Think of public transport , which could also do more for the environment
Too little is being done to make educational establishments more efficient while maintaining access to them for the broad mass of the population
We often accuse people - our own citizens - of lacking the willingness and courage to take risks
The European Union is indeed not a supermarket
We should be perfectly capable of combining the objectives of sustainable development with social market economic policies
We will have succeeded when people throughout Europe have an appropriate social security network available to them
My group is firmly convinced that - even if only to avoid unfair competition - this network must also embrace those who have migrated here
Let me conclude by reiterating my warm welcome , and that of my group , for this paper
The candidate countries are innocent by@@ stand@@ ers in that debate and should not be penalised for having being pres@@ sured into making their views known
The second point I would like to make is on the issue of governance
This document is a useful step forward in the improvement of EU governance and to that extent we welcome it warmly
It is crucial that governance is improved at an institutional level
There is no point in one institution or another raising its game if the other institutions do not reciproc@@ ate
De@@ ad@@ lines have slip@@ pe@@ d; the group should have concluded its work at the end of last year and the new deadline for the spring summit also now seems unrealistic
It is essential that we all pull our weight in the three institutions concerned to make this institutional approach a reality
Let me give you an example
You cite at length in your document the very laudable attempts in the European Commission to apply impact assessments of a number of key legislative proposals
I think you are proposing to do that on 31 proposals in 2004
We would certainly urge you to redouble those efforts in the weeks ahead
It is a display of what I would term blind optimism
Worse still , I find it to be extremely dated and swamped with useless , obvious facts
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , world peace is severely threatened and the UN is in danger of losing credibility
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the members of my group are not all pro-@@ Europe , to say the least , but they are re@@ alists
Today we are discussing the budget guidelines and the Commission policy strategy at the same time , as we hoped that a kind of synergy would arise between the two
Indeed , we have little time left in this legislative period
I take as an example the agreements concerning chemicals
In that case , of course , there is no way we can make that 2004 implementation date , and my group is concerned about this
In a different context , too , the motto of my group in recent months has always been ' make law not war '
In our view , legal instruments and abiding by agreements are ess@@ enti@@ al; especially in matters of human rights and democracy
We should like , therefore , to make further agreements on the clauses included in the treaties with third countries
Parliament must play a role in monitoring those agreements , and conclusions must also be drawn
The equal treatment of men and women also touches the heart of the Union 's values
Last Saturday was 8 March - International Women 's Day - and so I thought it fitting to say something about that here , too
The directives have been very influential in the emancipation of women and it is vital that they are complied with , including in the candidate countries
This is a part of the acquis communautaire that has to be adopted without transitional periods
I expect the Commission to indicate whether , in its opinion , it has sufficient financial and administrative means for this
If not , this is another part that must be included in the budgetary procedure
I should now like to turn to a point of an entirely different order
The report by Mrs Gill states - against her wishes , incidentally - that political parties have to be paid out of Parliament 's budget
Have we not learnt anything from the report by the Court of Auditors , which said that there must be no interconnection between the groups and the political parties ?
In addition , this would make the line between don@@ ating money and buying votes a very fine one
In the view of my group , that is unacceptable
Ladies and gentlemen , President Prodi , today , in addition to the Commission strategy for 2004 , we are debating the economic and budget guidelines
That , however , is the only part of this debate with which I agree
Perhaps Mr Prodi will be able to explain why the Commission is speaking this way when the analyses carried out by Eurostat and the OECD clearly paint a pessimistic picture
In this context , this Commission notes that 2004 will see the completion of the objectives that it set at the beginning of its mandate '
This passage merits consideration in view of what happened to the previous Commission and the political objective of transparent , effective management
It is up to you to prove to us that you are not taking the same path , and that will not leave us much time to police the world
Mr President , today , the Commission is presenting us with a communication on its annual policy strategy , with regard to which I would like to make several comments
This phrase could give the wrong impression
It leads us to believe that the Commission is a government adopting its policy strategy
I would also note that the Council is not present today , and I do not know what conclusion to draw from this absence
It seems to us that flexibility should be present in all cases
President Prodi has just repeated yet again that , in a Europe with 25 States , we would have to abolish unanimous decisions and generalise qualified majority voting
Our opinion is that qualified majority voting will not work either if we do not also accept the right of veto for national parliaments and variable geometry
Mr President , the 2004 financial year will be an unusual one for several reasons
Firstly , our Budget will have to take into account the fact that , on 1 May of that year , ten new Member States will probably be joining us
For this to be possible , the financial perspective will have to be changed
Further discussions will be needed on this subject
Parliament has a very strong preference for a budget to be adopted in December of this year for 25 Member States
The budgets will therefore have to contain certain remarks to make this possible
Another new element of the 2004 budget to which I hope Members will become accustomed is a new system called ' activity-based budgeting '
As I have said , everyone will have to become accustomed to this
What are the priorities of the 2004 budget ?
The second priority of the budget is improving administrative capacity in those countries
How will they be able to cope with the enormous sums of money they receive and how can they see to it that good projects are submitted ?
I now wish to say something about the various budget head@@ ings; starting with heading 1 , agriculture
Everything will depend on the results of Commissioner Fischler 's mid-term review , but irrespective of this , we should like attention to be paid to a number of matters
First among these is the question as to the precise nature of the relationship between the payment of agricultural subsidies and European environmental guidelines
The second point concerns the question as to whether it will be possible to develop insurance schemes in the future for animal diseases
We are currently seeing avian influen@@ za in the Netherlands , and we have seen foot-and-mouth disease and swine fever
Furthermore , is it possible to take further action to promote the sale of agricultural products , especially high-quality agricultural products ?
Regarding heading 2 , structural funds , the main thing is that we have to do what we have promised
We shall have to investigate the consequences of the n + 2 rule and the consequences of the 4 % performance reserve
As regards heading 3 , internal policy actions , a number of items under this heading have already been laid down
For the rest , we shall have to devote attention to what Europe can do in the field of combating terrorism - which is very topical at this time
What can be done better at European level than in the individual Member States ?
What can we do towards the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice , towards better protection of the external borders and a better asylum policy ?
What can we do to improve nuclear safety in the new Member States ?
what can we do about the proliferation of agencies ?
It seems that every year yet more agencies are added
what can we do about the ageing population of Europe ?
As always , heading 4 requires special attention , particularly at this time
What will be the consequences of any crisis in Iraq or a crisis in the Middle East ?
We shall be confronted by many more points , and we shall therefore have to keep a close eye on those
Concerning heading 5 , administrative expenditure , we shall have to look carefully at the results of the Commission reform
We shall also have to see what the results of the extra allocation of officials have been which we have carried out in the past , et ce@@ ter@@ a
Regarding the last point , heading 7 , a decision was taken in Copenhagen to categor@@ ise aid to Turkey under heading 7 , and the Commission agrees
The Council , however , has also said that we shall have to wait until 2004 to look at whether negotiations with Turkey can begin
We shall have to look at whether this heading will have to be ren@@ amed and whether we shall have to divide it up into different sub-@@ headings , et ce@@ ter@@ a
Lastly , I shall also be paying special attention to the point raised by Mr Elles
Mr President , the 2004 other institutions budget , as Mr Mulder has said , will be the first one for the European Union composed of 25 Member States
Consequently , it is likely to be more complex than any other and I would therefore like to thank everyone at the outset for their cooperation
For me it is imperative that the European institutions are provided with the necessary means to complete their preparations , because enlargement must be visibly successful to the European citizen
Within this context , there are three main themes in my resolution
Firstly , to achieve greater accountability through improved presentation and transparency of the budget
I want to improve the quality of the spending , not just achieve the spending
There is a need for further development of the information on most important cost factors , to achieve greater effectiveness and sound financial management
Real transparency will only really be evident externally to European citizens if we have it in the first instance internally
Our current system does not always lend itself readily to achieving this goal
Decision-@@ making is too centralised and there is not enough devolution and delegation in management structures
Whilst we are on transparency , one of the major new areas under consideration is funding for political parties
Surely this will leave us open to allegations that we are looking after our own political interest
This budget line should remain with the Commission , which has the mechanisms for managing it objectively
The Commission is wrong to take a very short-term view and propose otherwise
My second main concern is that we connect and communicate more coherently with the people of Europe
We need to be more innovative and ambitious in almost every area of our operation , never more so than in our information and communication policies
When it comes to infor@@ matics , our website has to be seen more as a communication tool than just an information port
Parliament has to play an even greater role in the interinstitutional communication strategy executed by the Commission
Furthermore , we need greater endeavours by everyone to ensure active citizenship and civic participation
It is therefore crucial that European citizens are better informed about the activities of Parliament and how European legislation can influence their daily lives
To achieve this we need to consider creating a European public media space
My third theme is to create a flexible framework for the future operations of Parliament and other institutions
It has to be said , though , that this is a fairly tame set of proposals
Within these proposals there is one for establishing a tabling office , which is definitely a step in the right direction
I would have welcomed greater ambition and innovation from the Secretary-General , but I recognise the limited appetite our institution has for reform and change
In conclusion , I have been a rapporteur for only the last couple of months
However , I have discovered the process to be extremely instructive
I have found no@@ oks and cr@@ ann@@ ies in this House that I never knew existed
If I may beg your indulgence , I would like to share some of my initial impressions with you
I have come across some amaz@@ ingly talented , committed and hard-@@ working people , but for every one of them there are two who just appear to flo@@ at
It is remarkable that this House achieves what it does and continues to evolve , given the resistance in almost every structure
There are few who have truly appreciated the full implications of enlargement
There is a belief that we can carry on doing things as we have up to now , but just do them ten times more
The people of the new Member States have had to show extreme flexibility in moving from the old system to the new system
We in the institutions need to start showing similar flexibility if we are to enhance the credibility of our institutions
Enlargement will become a reality in 2004 , and we in the institutions must do everything possible to ensure that it is a success from the very outset
That being so , it necessarily follows that Parliament has , as agreed , the right to examine the appropriateness of the proposal to the financial adjustment of the framework
For the first time , too , there will be financial aid , for example for the decommissioning of atomic power stations
The Commission also proposes that funds for Turkey should be substantially increased in order to support processes of reform and its preparations for accession to the European Union
The Commission will , in addition , be putting forward a new proposal for dealing with migration issues within the various policy areas
We will be proposing a new multiannual programme for this
In so far as that is the case , I also hope that we will be able to bring the Budget procedure to a satisfactory conclusion
I also want to congratulate Mrs Gill on her report
I would like to use the time remaining to me to deal briefly with two questions that have been put
The first question has to do with the proposal for an instrument for the Budget lines in Chapter A-30
We will be putting such a proposal to Parliament at the end of April
In 2004 , enlargement - an historic event - will be a reality
I take the view that this is in fact a prop@@ itious time to shift to a five-year cycle
We are fortunate in that we will have the time to debate these matters together and determine the best framework
As the task of securing our borders is a matter of common interest , should it not find its expression in some sort of joint financing ?
Enlargement will result in increased economic disparities within the European Union , and this will make particular demands on the funds we will be injecting as an expression of solidarity
These tasks will make it necessary for us to submit proposals
I can already promise you that we will make use of the time available to us this year to work closely with Parliament in elabor@@ ating these proposals
It is for that reason that we urgently need the requisite funds to secure our borders and defend ourselves against the trafficking of human beings
We continue to need unambiguous common rules for legal immigration
The reinforcement of Europol and Eurojust , along with the fight against terrorism , continue to be among the European Union 's most urgent tasks
It is with specific reference to enlargement that I want to draw attention today to the increasing cost of internal security in the European Union of the future
To begin with , I am pleased that Mr Mulder is a rapporteur this year
The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development would like to make a couple of main points with regard to the guidelines
To begin with , we note that a particular policy is starting to take shape with regard to animal diseases in Europe
Regarding the keeping of animals , the European Union has different legislation from other parts of the world , and our policy makes animals more vulnerable to disease
I therefore welcome the fact that Mr Mulder 's report includes what is necessary in that regard
That means that we must do more for promotion , market orientation and the organisation of the financial policy in this field
The third point concerns the new Member States , in regard to which this is a historic budget
I refer to the report by Mr X@@ a@@ ver Mayer , in which he expressly asks that the Sapard funding be paid out in any case in the new Member States
Mr President , one of the clear messages from this report today is the need to introduce procedures which will simplify the Structural Funds payments regime in Europe
It is also important that the European Commission strictly adheres to enforcing the principle of additionality through uniform verification methods
That is the view of the Regional Policy , Transport and Tourism Committee of this Parliament
The committee believes that it is important to speed up the introduction of all the streamlining measures needed to improve the quality of Structural Fund spending in Europe
I welcome the introduction of activity-based budgeting , and the setting of clear and measurable objectives will greatly aid the budgetary process
We all agree that the EU budget must be framed in such a way as to meet its objectives
I should also like to mention the Committee on Culture , Youth , Education , the Media and Sport
Both of these committees come into very close contact with the individual European citizen
In recent years the Petitions Committee has developed the possibility of inviting petitioners to attend committee meetings , where appropriate , to have their petition addressed
We need to ensure that there is adequate funding to enable citizens to do that , where appropriate
Pe@@ ti@@ tioning Parliament is an essential right for the citizens of Europe
The Petitions Committee often offers the citizen a way of cutting through the bureaucracy of Europe to address issues affecting their lives
I am talking about only a very modest increase in the sums available , but this would send out a very big message to the European people
We must also remember that the Ombudsman is the other great defender of citizens ' rights
According to Eurobarometer , 87 % of citizens recognise their right to go to the European Ombudsman
We have just appointed a new Ombudsman
5 % of total expenditure - we must have an effective procedure for the A-30 lines
I heard what the Commissioner said earlier
Tim@@ ing is critical in this
I hope that we will have the procedures in place so that bodies like the European Youth Or@@ che@@ str@@ a and the Y@@ e@@ h@@ ud@@ i Men@@ u@@ h@@ in Foundation know that their future is assured
My remarks are also addressed to the representatives of the Council although they do not appear to be present
Thanks are due to the rapporteur for his ideas and for the care he has taken to include most of the ideas expressed by others into the report
My group fully endorses the report
Indeed we support it so strongly that we have not tabled a single amendment to it in the House
We trust that only a limited number of the amendments tabled by other groups will be adopted
Turning to a more contentious issue , as the rapporteur mentioned , the 2004 budgetary period will be unusual throughout
Initially , the budget will apply to 15 Member States
At the close of the period it will , however , apply to 25
This will call for an additional effort to reach understanding between the three institutions , whereas relations are currently somewhat strained
Times are hard for Europe and even harder for the wider world
The 2004 budget should represent a statement of faith in ourselves
We should be confident of our potential and abilities as Europeans
Further , the 2004 budget should help to strengthen Europe 's role and influence beyond its borders
This is sorely needed as our common foreign policy , its instruments and even the individuals charged with operating them appear to have gone missing in advance of the action
The Europe fores@@ had@@ owed in the Mulder report is a united Europe
It is a Europe able to generate competitiveness and employment
It is also a Europe to be relied on by its partners in the wider world , and a Europe better able to manage its common policies
Interinstitutional cooperation is one of the prerequisites to such a Europe
Paragraphs 2 , 3 and 5 of this very report state that enlargement financial perspectives are to be approved jointly by the Council and the European Parliament
This does not seem to be the case at present
Global amounts for the adjustment of financial perspectives must not be set unilaterally
Parliament must be entitled to identify the shortfall in these areas and negotiate adequate sums
The Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats is prepared to negotiate with the Council and the Commission concerning these areas
They are key to the achievement of the objectives identified by Mr Mulder
In the present climate of dis@@ unity and dissent , the Union 's institutions are called on to illustrate dialogue and cooperation , not to contribute to the unrest
Each individual issue has to be approached and discussed in a frank and transparent way
We have to ensure that transparency and clarity in matters concerning the European Budget are capable of being communicated to the public
We are on the threshold of enlargement
Parliament is one of the two component parts of the decision-making authority , and we will not allow the Council to present us with fa@@ its accompl@@ is in these matters
The means are available to us to do something about this
That is something we cannot accept
This tendency may have been allevi@@ ated somewhat , but it remains the case that far too much of the funds we have cannot be made use of
In order that we may make progress in this area , I ask you to take the simplification of administration further
We have to make it abundantly clear that we are not giving anybody carte blanche
Now for the final point that I want to address
At European level , that will have an effect on pensions
We want all policies to be considered from the point of view of what these changes will mean in the future ?
This is now the first year involving the activity-based budget , which will make it simpler for us all in future to interpret the political messages in the budget
I should like to begin by thanking Mr Mulder and Mrs Gill for their constructive and well set-@@ out discussion documents for the work on the 2004 budget
The objective of this year 's budget has been to unify Europe , for enlargement means that there is a need for a range of new initiatives
If we do not get the problems solved now , matters will become so much the more difficult in an enlarged EU
It may be argued that enlargement will provide special opportunities for sorting out a number of problems
On the other hand , the difficulties in solving them will also be exacerbated
It is important for us to set aside the necessary funds for the continued development of administration , training and social dialogue in the new Member States
That also applies to the budgets for the agencies in the spheres of training and the labour market
The last point I wish to make is that , upon enlargement , the EU will acquire new borders in the east
It is important for Tacis to continue to ensure that the projects are properly implemented
Nuclear safety , in particular , is a high political priority
I am delighted that , in this budget process , we can also welcome our future fellow MEPs from the new Member States
That is a strand of the debate and of the budget to which I am very much looking forward
Mr President , Commissioners , I have had a poor impression in the European Convention of the direction in which the EU 's policy on languages is heading
There the proposed amendments to the Pra@@ esidium 's draft constitution are not translated into the official languages of the EU
The discussions held by the Convention 's working groups have only been interpreted into two or three languages
A constitution is being drafted , however , which is at a higher level than the Member States ' national legislation
As the Convention is called the Convention on the Future , language restrictions and the destruction of national linguistic identities would seem to be the future of the EU
Both budget reports give attention to language , translation and interpreting
When Mrs Gill speaks of controlled multilingualism I am not sure that that means equality for all languages
When distance interpreting is mentioned , I am not sure that that means distance interpreting for all languages
If not all languages in the EU are to be used equally , let us draw lots for those languages that are to be the so-called working languages
Another linguistic outrage is the fact that the European Parliament visitor 's service no longer has a Fin@@ n@@ ish-speaking official
Otherwise , the guidelines for the budgetary procedure are on such a general level that there are only a few general remarks to make
Parliament 's unanimous political will would seem to be that there should be a determination to reduce the amount of unpaid payment appropriations , or RALs
Many in our group oppose the introduction of financial support for Europarties , as the parties would then become supranational
These supranational taxes are unacceptable to many in our group
Mr President , Mr President of the Commission , Commissioner , the defining of a strategy for the coming year provides us with an excellent opportunity to set priorities
We can endorse this choice of political priorities
This optimism about one authority single-handedly bringing about social change does not square with our view of the matter
The Commission should adopt a more modest attitude in this regard and should not take on so many tasks
We consider that making stability a priority was the right choice
After all , we need to take the global terrorist threat most seriously
The elaboration of this policy area in concrete terms , however , is once again at odds with our idea of security and stability in Europe
I am talking about the NATO alliance , with the United States of America as a strong ally
Is the Commission prepared to define its position on this matter ?
Congratulations are due to Mr Mulder for his commendable report on the guidelines for the 2004 budgetary procedure
Unfortunately , I cannot talk in such positive terms about the report by Mrs Gill
The advantages she envisages in the draft statute for European political parties completely escape us
The Commission wants to get no less than 75 % of the budget for these European parties out of the EU budget
Is that not completely out of proportion ?
Political parties are free associations of citizens
Is it not logical , then , for citizens , who form the basis of every party , to give financial support to the party of their choice ?
This also respects the natural link between parties and their support base , which can only be beneficial to their involvement in politics
National political parties that wish to associate at European level should pay for that themselves - that is to say , their members should
European political parties are by definition much further removed from the bed of our citizens than national parties
If , therefore , we give those European parties an enormous subsidy from Community funds , we increase the gap between citizen and politics
We find completely incredible Mrs Gill 's analysis that a propaganda offensive would bring the parties closer to the citizen
What visible effect have European campaigns about European citizenship or the benefits of the euro produced ?
The answer is none , so why should that succeed now ?
In the opinion of our group , it would be better to get the draft statute off the table as quickly as possible
Mr President , as the shadow rapporteur , I wish to raise four points on the Gill report
the rules are already set down and agreed between the three institutions
I understood that there was also a move by the Council of Ministers and the Commission to move this budget towards Parliament 's financing
An amendment has been tabled and I urge Members to vote - perhaps against their own groups - for Parliament to have control of the political party funding budget
Secondly , on buildings , the Bureau has made too many decisions without referring back to the appropriate committee - the Committee on Budgets
I welcome Paragraph 40 of the Mrs Gill 's report , which I broadly support
That calls on the Secretary-General to submit a report by 1 June 2004 outlining ' the functional justifications for the new building projects '
I hope that report will include the proposals for two new conference rooms here
The United Kingdom Conservatives and Socialists are opposed to those two conference rooms , as they would spoil the very pleasant entrance to the European Parliament by the flags
There is no functional justification
The conference rooms - in particular the large ones - are under-utilised
There is more than enough room , even with the enlargement countries , to provide all the necessary facilities
That is a very important matter and , in future , we at least will be requiring functional justification before spending is approved
I should like to draw attention to a very positive amendment - of which I am sure Mrs Gill will approve - to Paragraph 28
This clarifies the movement towards more facilities to cover multilingualism , which is particularly important for enlargement
It concerns electronic guidance , computer work@@ stations and directions to rooms
I know that as a new Member three years ago I had great difficulty in Brussels and Strasbourg even in finding rooms
Therefore , monitors and perman@@ en@@ tly-@@ installed signs sc@@ rolling through the various languages would be a very important addition
Finally , there is a reference in the report to the Court of Auditors
It does very important work and needs extra resources , a suggestion I fully endorse
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I too would like to thank the rapporteurs
The historical goal we are about to achieve - the enlargement of the Union - calls for total consistency in our budgetary decisions
The success of enlargement and integration will depend to a large extent on the way these policies are revised and the importance given to them in the budget
There are just two things I want to say
The budget before us will be the first to be drafted for a Community of 25 Member States
For this reason the important role of the rapporteurs in drafting this budget must be emphasised
Fortunately , we have activity-based budgeting , which is now being implemented in earnest for the first time
It will improve the transparency of the budget and give a better picture of the work that is done within the framework of the European Union
Ac@@ ti@@ vit@@ y-based budgeting provides a straight answer to the question of what each activity actually costs
East@@ ward enlargement is a challenge for everyone , and has to be taken into consideration throughout the entire budget preparation process
That starts with administration
We must continue to have respect for the individual languages of the Member States and hold multilingualism in esteem
The greatest challenge , however , concerns the Structural Funds
Enlargement to the east will be an enormous rebuilding project , the largest that Western Europe has embarked on since the Second World War
For it to succeed , the administration of the Structural Funds must be simplified and dealt with more efficiently
Only in this way can the results we are striving for be achieved
Mr President , the Commission has emphasised in its communication that enlargement of the European Union will be the core challenge of 2004
In agricultural expenditure , the proportion is as low as 2
What I expect is that the Commission will not delay long in producing precise figures and an analysis of why this is so and of the obstructions involved
There is a need here for greater confidence in the system 's fairness , for not one euro of structural support funding must be wasted
For many citizens in the European Union 's regions , the projects that depend on such funds are often the last fragile hope for the maintenance of their jobs
I therefore expect absolute transparency of the whole procedure , coupled with wide-ranging public relations work , which cannot fail to improve the public 's perception of the European Union
Mr President , the President of the Commission recalled the context of the Commission 's strategy for 2004
Mr Prodi was bound to speak of the crisis over Iraq , enlargement and the strategic need for a political project for an enlarged Union
He also referred to the in-depth assessment of ourselves and our role in the world currently under way in the Convention preparing for the Intergovernmental Conference
I should like to focus on foreign policy
Clearly , the Union needs an effective , transparent and visible foreign policy
It would therefore be appropriate for the Commission to give some indication of how the policy on decentralisation has evolved
An update on abnormal outstanding payment commitments would also be helpful
Parliament has been concerned about both these issues for some time now
In my view , serious thought should be given to heading 4 on foreign policy
We have been making do and mending for years
We are , however , likely to be called on to take urgent decisions on Iraq
We need to deal with Afghanistan , the Middle East , the Balkans and Mediterranean policy too
In addition I believe it is essential for us to review our transatlantic relations
They are bound to be affected following the conflict with Iraq
Last but not least , Commissioner , we should tackle the matter of relations with Latin America
I urge the Commission to be consistent as it presents this year 's draft budget proposals
It must honour the undertakings given at the Madrid Summit
Additional priorities cannot be financed out of the same resources
Commissioner , I urge you to bear these considerations in mind
If we do not do so I believe we shall continue to be excluded from negotiating tables and be reduced to bank@@ rolling major international events
We will never be involved in decision-making
I congratulate Mr Prodi on the vision he has shown on opening this debate on strategic priorities
The debate should be linked to the debate on budget guidelines for 2004
The accession of the new Member States , whose GDP is below the Community average and whose needs are greater , will also cause severe problems
The most recent consultation with the Council made it possible for this to be guaranteed , and I see this as having been a step in the right direction
Such cooperation between the Council and Parliament is a foundation for our future endeavours
That can be changed if Parliament is informed and involved in good time
If that happens , I think these Budget guidelines may well usher in a new stage in cooperation between Parliament and the Council
I think this ad hoc group gives us a good opportunity to cooperate with the Commission in seeing exactly what has been done with European taxpayers ' money
This working group is about to start work
The first would be to exaggerate our differences , while the second would be to consider them negligible
This initiative is entirely new and will certainly begin to give some credibility to the stated objectives , which you have just recalled so clearly , President Prodi
We must now hope that this instrument , which was swiftly drawn up in accordance with Parliament , can be extended to all future EU operations
Might I ask you , President Prodi , what your own reaction was to this proposal and when you think it could start to be implemented ?
I am sure that this is not what the majority of our fellow European citizens want
What we have to deal with , quite specifically , is how the Financial Perspective is to be adjusted to take account of enlargement
We could certainly have done with more explicit statements in this area
I think it is a piti@@ able thing for the Greens to table amendments aimed at deleting these passages from Mrs Gill 's report
That is the very opposite of what we need if we want to accommodate over a hundred new Members in this House
So now , Commissioner , here comes my request that we should now be concentrating on the matters in hand
I have mentioned the subject of the Financial Perspective , so let me remind you of the Andreasen case
I have here an internal memorandum from the Commission , which reaches an assessment different from that which you set out in the Committee on Budgetary Control
Now , at long last , we have to sort out the problem with the accounting systems
One of this Commission 's great promises was that this parliamentary term would see things getting moved forward
If we manage that , we will have achieved much for Europe
Madam President , I believe three basic issues arise out of the 2004 budget guidelines
These are firstly , the potential level of expenditure , secondly , improved implementation , and thirdly , strategic options for expenditure
As regards the level of expenditure , the Union 's budget currently represents 1
02 % of gross Community income , and is at its lowest level
The present perspectives would allow an additional 5 000 billion
The same level of expenditure is planned for the 2004 budget
We are therefore operating in austerity mode , which should please the Council
Sound implementation is crucial for the 2004 budget
Pay@@ ment take up has been well below that forecast during the last three years
The total surplus for those three years amounts to some 23 000 billion
Last year 's declaration on implementation profiles and the plan to do away with the abnormal RAL must therefore be followed through
Concerning priorities , I am sure Mr Mulder 's report is on the right lines
The 2004 budget is crucial and represents a new departure for the Union
There are a number of reasons why this is so
The citizens understand that their security , freedom and prosperity demand appropriate budgetary decisions and common instruments
External border controls , the fight against organised crime and terrorism demand increased capacity for Europol and Eurojust
Finally , the promotion of business activity is crucial to the success of an enlarged Union
Many issues are still outstanding
I refer for example to the potential financial implications of agricultural reform or of the adoption of the adjustment of the financial perspectives
I have to say that I am amazed the Council is not represented in the House today
Nonetheless , the Council must realise that there is only one way of dealing with the challenges before us , and that is by reaching agreement with Parliament
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , we are discussing the Budget and the strategy for 2004
So the crucial question is what democratic control there will be when we get a common defence policy
In this area , democratic control is exercised primarily by way of the Budget procedure
It is in view of the Convention that we need to make certain demands now , demands that will be significant in 2004
Nevertheless , and because the situation is not entirely rosy , I should like to make some criticisms of the European Commission document that has been presented to us today
Firstly , I agree with the rapporteur on the need to insist that the European Commission makes increasing rural development aid under the CAP its priority guideline
This is precisely the area in which the greatest disparities between Member States can be seen
Secondly , I urge the Commission to step up the process of streamlining and improving the implementation of the budget , especially in its structural funds policy
Consequently , some regions ' levels will increase , with major risks of losing structural funds because they exceed the minimum levels that would entitle them to Community aid
Statis@@ tical indicators alone cannot justify terminating a cohesion policy for the current Member States
It is entirely in the European Union 's interest to see its current Member States enjoy high rates of growth , more employment and more opportunities
Such an assumption is not only fatal , but also false
In this context , the first is support for the social dialogue
In practically all the candidate countries there is still the need to establish and reinforce structures that will make the social dialogue a reality
The second point is the need to improve conditions in the workplace
Our work in the Member States treats health and safety at work as a priority , and the same must be true in the candidate countries
I would refer you to the Lisbon resolution in which we highlighted competitiveness and employment opportunities and stressed the need for them
In the candidate countries , restructuring affects not only agriculture , but still also major , and outdated , sectors of industry
They need our help with that , help that we can - and should - provide by means of European Union funds
In all these areas , we rely , of course , on the knowledge of the agencies
We therefore expect them to receive the financial appropriations that they need
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like briefly to respond to some of the questions , which are extremely interesting
It is a pity that the majority of the Members are absent
This should be a dialogue
First of all , he raised the issue of whether this perspective is just for five years or whether it is for seven years
We are not in a position to decide , and so we have kept our options open
Mr Elles also raised the issue of the number of Commissioners
The problem is not the number of Commissioners but the authority to organise and take decisions accorded to the President
Whatever the number of Commissioners , the question is how to organise the Commission 's work
It can be managed well with a small number of Commissioners or it can be managed well with a large number of Commissioners
Mr Elles raised a number of other points which I feel it is important to discuss
For instance , he pointed out possible shortcomings in the chapter on external relations , particularly as regards the transatlantic partnership
Indeed , the ' peace group ' set up by Commissioner Lamy is concerned with this too
Re@@ forming the Commission has been a priority right from the beginning and , starting in 2004 , we will have completely new Staff Regulations
It has been a huge undertaking
In any case , however , we must realise that , should a disciplinary procedure be necessary , all the rights of those involved in the procedure must be respected
In any case - I would stress - the letter must be made public without delay
As far as the famous requests still outstanding are concerned , I will look into it
I will do everything possible and more , employing all available resources to look into it as quickly as possible
I take the blame for the delay in producing some replies , but I believe we have a bar@@ rage of extremely important questions to deal with
I would also like to focus on the point raised by Mr Clegg concerning better regulation , for it is related to these issues
An agreement is imminent , but I must say that my impression is that Parliament is taking less interest in the matter today than it did some time ago
I would like to take this opportunity to call for a last spur@@ t so that an agreement can be achieved during the interinstitutional summit on 19 March
I formally urge the Presidency of Parliament to make the most of this opportunity and to be prepared for a political conclusion next week
The Commission , for its part , is genuinely ready for this
General Morillon asked for information on the budget heading and research related to defence
We are exploring the possibility of financing military research outside the Sixth Framework Programme for research but we do not yet have a definitive answer on this matter
I have pointed out the need for a debate - it would be useful to discuss the issue and we will submit solutions as soon as possible
The Commission has presented - and it is supplementing that material today - an extremely precise plan with a clear policy which treats the Balkans as part of Europe
They will be Members of the Union , but they will be subject to the same strict conditions which have applied to the countries of this first phase of enlargement
There are no discounts
The door will be open when they approach it , but they will only be allowed to come in when they are ready
There is absolutely no leeway on this
We are in an extremely difficult situation in which everything is falling apart
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 12 noon
Madam President , the Committee on Budgets decided that it would be wise to draw up a report on this subject
Because of that , I am wearing three h@@ ats at the same time - if that is possible
I wear one hat as the rapporteur and reflect the wishes of the committee in the way it has voted and amended the original draft
I wear another hat as the Chairman of the committee , thereby keeping an eye on the rapporteur
I wear my third hat as a British Labour Member who is at odds with a number of amendments from his own political family , the PSE
It is fair to say that the only change I attempted to make to this report was to try to merge Paragraphs 6 and 8 to make it more coherent
However , I failed to achieve a consensus amongst the political groups and , therefore , the report stands as it is
However , I would run a mile - well perhaps I could manage half a mile - from the amendments by the PSE Group
Let me make it absolutely clear that I am not speaking as a British Labour Member and , therefore , I cannot say those things
I have to wear my hat as the rapporteur and speak as the rapporteur , knowing full well that the Chairman is keeping a watchful eye on what I say
In fairness , the report is acceptable to all the political groups
The vote was almost unanimous in committee , but there are one or two small points of disagreement on own-@@ resources
That is why the PSE Group has tabled two amendments
What we are all agreed upon is that the budget procedure needs to be simplified
Codecision is needed and , therefore , compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure need to be eradicated
This is stated quite simply in the first three paragraphs of Mrs Buitenweg 's report
We need to reform , update and simplify our procedures
Under those conditions , compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure would disappear
Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , the European Union 's Budget exists to finance its policies and its institutions
That is indeed provided for in the outline of the constitutional draft on which the Convention is working
The financial constitution would thereby lay down Parliament 's budgetary rights
The Convention must come to treat this as a core point
I also congratulate him on his ability , so to speak , to wear three h@@ ats at once
Among these is the principle that the Budget 's receipts and expenditure should balance and that expenditure should not be allowed to be funded from credit
Even when it comes to the proposal that the European Development Fund should in future be an integrated part of the Community Budget , there is complete agreement
Are our financial arrangements sufficiently autonom@@ ous; is it enough for Parliament to be able only to give an opinion on the own-@@ resources resolution ?
The Commission 's view on all these questions is that , no , what we have at present is not enough , and change is urgently needed
When taking decisions on the own resources , it follows that the sensitivities of the Council and of the national parliaments must also be taken into account
Even so , the European Parliament should be accorded the right of codecision in this area too
The financial structure should reflect the fact that the EU is a union of Member States and of citizens
The Commission has therefore , in its proposal , advocated more direct involvement in financing the European Budget
If I may turn to the Budget procedure , the Commission shares the position stated in Parliament 's report , that the Budget procedure should be simplified and resources concentrated
If this procedure were to be adopted , the amendment of Council resolutions would require a super-@@ qualified majority in Parliament
The constitution 's financial chapter should describe the whole of the Budget process in simple words and with unambiguous rules
It should therefore also refer to the implementation of the Budget and specify not only the Commission 's responsibilities but also the Member States ' obligation to cooperate
It should , with this in mind , at last enshrine the possibility of instituting the office of Public Prosecutor at Community level
The public expect Community assets to be able to be protected effectively and fraud to result in criminal prosecution
The Convention now affords us the opportunity to establish new rules , appropriate to the Union 's development , for the European Budget , which is an important Community instrument
Madam President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I must congratulate Mr Wynn on his work as both Chairman and rapporteur
His is an excellent report
I am delighted it has been favourably received by all the political groups
This is an indication of the scale of our effort to achieve consensus and support the report
Further , my group strongly supports adjustment of the current system of distinguishing between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure
This has now become a common position of Parliament
It should always be taken into account when specific types of expenditure can be guaranteed , notably in the case of agriculture
The budget would be adopted by a codecision procedure adjusted to this specific case
In the event of failure to reach agreement , the Council would have the final say on income and Parliament on expenditure
As regards the financial perspectives , we believe it is imperative to en@@ dow them with greater flexibility
This would ensure an effective response to unexpected situations
Un@@ duly rigid provisions have sometimes served to safeguard expenditure
On other occasions , however , such rigidity has hindered more effective allocation of resources
We fully endorse the proposal by the Convention 's working group to include financial perspectives in the treaty , together with provisions on discipline and budgetary cooperation
In the interests of providing continuity regarding financial decisions , financial perspectives should cover the five-year term of Parliament and the Commission
Finally , reform of the budgetary procedure must be based on simplification with a view to greater democratisation , legitimacy and transparency
We therefore fully endorse the proposal to do away with first reading in the Council , as this seems to be consistent with the objective of simplification
Further , we reject the amendments leading beyond this debate , as we wish the document presented to the Convention to enjoy the fullest possible support of the House
Madam President , only a few stal@@ war@@ ts are in the House at present
Nonetheless , history has shown that the budget is the cornerstone of representative democracies
They can only flourish if Parliament controls the sovereign 's expenditure
We are on the point of adopting the first European constitution
The Union has been in existence for 46 years and budgetary powers have remained unchanged for the last 30
I therefore believe updating is imperative
Several points are now obsolete
In addition , if the treaty were applied to the letter it would not be in line with the reality of present day budgets
Mr Garriga Polledo referred to budgetary perspectives a moment ago
There is no provision for these in the treaty , though the Council often seems to be unaware of that fact
Ladies and gentlemen , the constitution must encompass the budgetary process and own resources
The man@@ tra of seven@@ teenth century revolu@@ tions was ' no taxation without representation '
There is strong democratic representation in the form of this House , but taxation is not approved democratically
Essentially , the own resources system amounts to national contributions by another name , even though these are legally the Union 's own resources
Resources should henceforth come directly from the citizen
The citizen would then understand that taxes are destined to the Union 's budget
This is a basic feature of democratic responsibility
Otherwise , Finance Ministers will go on collecting the money and the Community will go on spending it and the reasons will remain unclear
This is bad for democratic control
It is therefore necessary to move towards a system enabling this connection to be made without increasing the total tax burden on the citizens
Pers@@ onal and possibly progressive taxation should be introduced
It would then no longer be possible to alle@@ ge , as is often the case , that unemployed citizens in eastern Germany are subsidising large landowners in Andalusia
Please excuse this crude simplification
The result is unhealthy populism
It is essential to ensure that it will no longer be possible to distinguish between the various countries ' contributions under any future financial system
A citizen 's contribution should be based on his or her personal resources
It should not depend on his or her place of residence
In my view , this must be a key feature of the new approach , that is , of the new way of tackling the system of resources
Madam President , this is the main point the Socialist Group wishes to make
Other honourable Members will speak on further aspects of our stance
I give him my most sincere thanks for that
Nevertheless , my group is not completely satisfied with the end result
We have chosen not to table any amendments , because it would result in a kind of hotchpotch , but instead to table an alternative resolution
We have opted to do that precisely because absolute clarity is necessary when it comes to establishing the form the budgetary procedure of the future should take
For example , we also wanted to make it very clear right from the outset how competences should be divided up
Should the negotiations fail , the Council would simply have the last word on revenue and Parliament on expenditure
In our resolution , we also keep repeating the necessity of having codecision powers in all legislation
I should like to conclude that budgetary codecision is of no benefit to us as a Parliament if we do not have legislative codecision
The two matters must go hand in hand
Madam President , Mr Wynn 's report is consistent with the very high standard we have come to expect from him in this House
However , he will understand if , from my group 's perspective , I cannot go along with the suggestion that we abolish the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure
I signal openly to the rapporteur that I will seek to remove this suggestion from what , as I have already said , is otherwise a very constructive report
The distinction is there for one simple reason and it has served its purpose well down the years
That reason is to de@@ politicise decision-making when it comes to the agricultural budget
Farming is perhaps the industry in the most precarious position in the European Union at present
There are on@@ sla@@ u@@ ghts on farm income from left , right and centre
I appeal to the House to consider this when voting tomorrow
Farm income in Ireland and many other Member States is very much dependent on the direct income support from the European Union budget
Stability arises from the fact that such expenditure has hitherto derived from legally binding assurances and we must continue to give these assurances
These informal amendments have rendered the current text redundant and obsolete
The next constitutional Treaty must contain articles covering the principles that govern the budget and the procedures for approving it
I wish to express my full and unequivocal agreement with the proposals for reform that have been tabled
Firstly , because I believe we must seize this opportunity to review the issue of the European Union 's funding
More Europe means , amongst other things , more money
The contribution of the Member States must be appropriate and in proportion to the objectives that the European Union wishes to achieve
It is entirely utopian to set objectives , such as those of the Lisbon Summit , which uphold the current financial framework
It should be added that the European Union itself must undertake a thorough@@ going study into its own resources for funding the EU budget
Thirdly , because I believe that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure and their respective procedures has become artificial
In this context , budgetary expenditure for the common agricultural policy would then be studied by the European Parliament under the codecision procedure
Greater involvement of the European Parliament in the CAP can only be positive for farmers and for rural development
This will provide greater control over the use of funds
I would remind you that every year , enormous sums intended for the CAP end up being refunded to the Member States because they have not been properly used
By the European Parliament having this greater ability to act , the economic , social and environmental interests of European farmers will be safeguarded
The European Union 's Budget must enjoy the very same democratic legitimacy in its function of financing European policy
Whilst it has to be admitted that the present system of finance works , it meets with criticism quite apart from its undemocratic nature
Neither what we receive from VAT or out of gross domestic income can really be described as the European Union 's own resources
It is not immediately evident to the public which taxes go towards financing the EU 's outgoings
The proportion of what are termed traditional own resources is decreasing all the time , and the whole system is mut@@ ating from genuine self-@@ financing into the transfer of lump sums
The structure of the Budget has ceased to provide any justification for it
Changes have had to be made in the structure of the European Budget 's expenditure over the past fifteen years
We can all , therefore , understand its importance
Re@@ forming the budgetary procedure is by no means a technical issue that can only be handled by specialists
it concerns our ability to give substance to European integration and demonstrate our solidarity through action
I personally would simply like to remind the participants in the current negotiations of their responsibilities
That means going beyond the sterile little game of defending national privileges and territory in the short term
That kind of attitude never leads to successful negotiations , ending instead with lame compromises which , at the end of the day , do not satisfy anyone
It is time we looked to see where the true interests of Europeans as a whole lie
We need to create a virtuous circle where the concessions made by the various parties ultimately benefit everyone
If this state of mind is allowed to triumph , I think it will be possible to seize the opportunity provided by the Convention
Mrs Guy-Quint , I would congratulate you on having managed to speak calmly and clearly amid this hul@@ lab@@ alo@@ o
The debate is closed
The vote will take place at 12 noon
Mr Mu@@ is did not attend last night
I should point out to the Member that in the matter of accountability the ELDR Group has an excellent record in this House
Mr President , it is an honour to be attacked by one of the Conservative Party 's young Turks
I gave the House information which I believed to be correct
Had I had different information , I would have communicated it
The next item is the vote
It has taken four years to bring the hundreds of committees into line with the new system and to prepare for the vote which we are about to take
Parliament has worked fu@@ riously to make substantial improvements to the comitology system
Mr President , the committee agreed overwhelmingly on the need to restrict self-@@ handling to ships ' crew
That is why I would like this made clear by the language used in the translations
Before I turn to the rapporteur for advice , I have been informed that Amendment no 48 , as you suggested , constitutes a linguistic amendment in several languages
It is an important linguistic clarification , but the primary amendment in this regard is Amendment no 13
I do not see the need to vote on the others
As regards the question of language , we should not be having a great debate about it right now , but should proceed as follows
The committee wants - as , I assume does this House - to delete the words ' regular land-based personnel ' from the Council 's version
Thus far , I believe that Mr Piecyk and I are of one mind without having to engage in great linguistic discussions
We will thus now vote on Amendment No 13
Mr President , I wish to ask whether , following the vote on Amendment No 13 , Amendments Nos 56 and 57 should now lapse
the purpose of Amendment No 13 was to restrict self-@@ handling to crew members
If I understand correctly , Amendments Nos 56 and 57 concern conditions for granting licences for port operators to undertake self-@@ handling
This makes no sense in my opinion , however , when we are restricting self-@@ handling to crew members
I put the rapporteur on notice that when we get to Amendments Nos 56 and 57 we will ask for his opinion
Mr President , my group believes that this amendment should not fall even if Amendment No 24 is adopted
Mr President , this amendment is redundant , as sentence 2 of Amendment No 24 makes provision for the eventuality of an appeal at law
The reference therein to Article 17 of the directive is final , and so we cannot now vote on any alternative options
There is no doubt in my mind that this amendment must lapse
Mr President , I do not agree with the rapporteur
The rapporteur seems adamant
My ruling , therefore , is to go with the rapporteur and rule against Amendment No 61
expects the legislative procedure to be concluded by the end of June 2003 at the latest '
The second split should be the remainder of that amendment
We would support the first part and oppose the second
expects the legislative procedure to be concluded by the end of June 2003 at the latest '
I ask for your permission , Mr President
There is no reason to have the remainder of the paragraph as it has been suggested
That is a matter for the Committee on Constitutional Affairs to deal with
I do not think it should be moved to Parliament 's budget , in the interests of transparency and accountability and also because it has cost implications
It is important that we leave it in the Commission 's budget
Therefore I suggest that we support Amendment No 8 as it stands
Mr President , just on a point of order , Mr Dover appears to have requested a split vote , and there are rules governing that sort of procedure
it will be a precedent that we should follow
That concludes the vote
It is now 20 years since it became compulsory in Britain for car drivers and fron@@ t-@@ seat passengers to wear seat belts
That law has saved an average of 7 lives every day
Yet lives are still being needlessly lost because those rules do not apply to co@@ ach passengers
Too often the European Parliament becomes bogged down with regulations which do little to help our constituents
This directive is our chance to make a real difference - to reduce the tragic waste of lives lost on our roads
That is why the British Conservatives welcome this report and congratulate all of those who have helped to bring forward these long-@@ overdue measures
However , we are disappointed that the proposals do not go further
It is time that the safety of children on school buses was given the consideration that it so urgently needs
It is unacceptable that children are being taken to school on buses without seat@@ belts and that many children are forced to stand due to there being too few seats
Naturally , I fully support this report
It is indeed bizarre that in the third millennium , road accidents are the main cause of death amongst children
As the rapporteur states , this proposal must be seen simply as an integral part of a broader action plan
I am referring , in particular , to improving road sign@@ age , to stepping up passive protection , to monitoring
Drugs are one of the issues of greatest concern to European citizens
Mr Pirker 's proposal responds to the steady increase in the production and trade in synthetic drugs
This does not apply to the legal trade in these substances , specifically the manufacture of medicines
Consequently , the way effectively to combat drugs lies , primarily , in effective precursor control
There are , however , some obstacles to this control and it cannot be undertaken simply by prohibiting the use of these substances
Prec@@ urs@@ ors are not used purely for illicit drug production , which means that ensuring effective control will entail some sacrifice on the part of medicine manufacturers , for example
I feel that the report has achieved a reasonable balance on this point
Lastly , I believe it is equally crucial to adopt measures on Internet sites that promote the sale of these substances and provide information on how to produce them
I have voted in favour of all of these four reports by Mrs Frassoni , despite some difficulties that this matter raises
Furthermore , all committee documents , with the exception of confidential documents , of course , should be accessible to the public
This is the only way of ensuring that the legislative process and Parliament 's powers as co-legislator are fully respected
Mr President , it is very good to see you again , and I hope to visit you again in person in future
I am very pleased that you are now President of Parliament , but I should just like to talk about this directive
My group , or at least D66 , voted for this directive to provide for the possibility of fair competition in ports and to prevent social dumping
That means that all parties , including self-@@ hand@@ lers , must have the required high social standards and professional qualifications
In addition , the Member States and the port authorities , in particular , must lay down conditions in the field of safety and environmental protection
Mr President , the ports of Har@@ w@@ ich , Feli@@ x@@ st@@ owe and T@@ il@@ bury are in my constituency
Corpor@@ ations providing port services must comply with transparency requirements in their financial dealings with the public authorities
However , there is no evidence of any such obligation on the part of the private sector
5 , the service provider has the right to employ personnel of his own choice , but no reference whatsoever is made to qualifications or training
The risks of social dumping are clear
I shall therefore vote to reject this directive , a position that will certainly not be shared by the majority of the EP
That is why I shall then vote for any amendments that seek to increase the protection of workers provided for by the text
Parliament , the Council and the Commission continue in and confirm their desire to liberalise port services
We supported and still support their action
That is why we have voted to reject the directive
It will lead to environmental , social and human tragedies , just like the liberalisation of the rail sector
These disasters will no longer take place along our coasts , like the Erika and Prestige shipwrecks , but within the ports
In order to combat liberalisation , we must promote a public port service that is coordinated at European level and guarantees the highest possible levels of safety and social standards
The debate is limited to ascertain@@ ing whether concerns for safety will make it possible to exclude pilotage and tow@@ age from port ' privatisation '
That said , our dock workers in Marseilles , S@@ è@@ te and other large ports will be handed over to the pirates of ultra-@@ liberalism
The destruction of port employment will be added to the destruction of fisheries employment
The rebellion and despair of these men in the face of a directive produced by the ha@@ w@@ ks of economic globalisation is understandable
As a result , the tran@@ shipment costs per quantity of cargo are already lower in these ports than in America or East Asia
They cannot operate at still lower costs , and yet they are forced to do just that
In ports such as these , the risk of social dumping and deteriorating safety is much greater than where one port has a virtual monopoly over a smaller hinterland
Furthermore , the directive will force EU Member States to act contrary to obligations they have entered into within the framework of the ILO Convention
The reluctance shown by some companies merely demonstrates a categorical rejection of the opening up of port services to competition
This autocratic logic is not just a rejection of the principle of a market economy
Following the shipwreck of the Prestige , concerns have been growing about maritime safety
I share these concerns because my country has a long coastline , which is highly dependent on maritime resources
For these reasons and because these problems also affect other countries in the European Union , the Jarzembowski report on port services warrants our full consideration
With regard to the regulations on pilotage , I think that it makes sense to remove these from the scope of this decision
Every Member State must be able , for reasons of public interest , to maintain the current system , taking account of specific local characteristics
This balance has already been achieved in the liberalisation of air and rail transport
With regard to social and labour legislation , the rights of workers in EU ports must be safeguarded
The services covered by this directive for tow@@ ing , mooring , car@@ go-@@ handling , including loading and unloading , do not warrant special attention
The issue lies in whether or not to exclude pilotage activities in those covered by this directive
In general , we think that the proposal is balanced and constructive , with the exception , however , of the inadequately justified limitation upon self-@@ handling
The opportunities for competition within this area are in this way reduced
We have therefore chosen to vote against the committee where these aspects are concerned
With regard to pilotage services , we agree with the proposal that the nature of these is such that they ought not to be covered by the directive
It also takes pilotage services a step forward
The points remaining for discussion are the directives on state aid and working conditions for port workers , particularly focusing on the provisions with regard to self-@@ handling
As far as the first point is concerned , Parliament 's amendments make clear what is expected of the Commission , and within what time limit
The second point is more complicated
If self-@@ handling is able to take place within excessively wide margins , there is a danger of it de@@ generating into cut@@ throat competition , with all the adverse consequences this entails
Unfortunately , the procedure does not give us any scope to prevent this at EU level
It is now up to national governments to do everything possible to eliminate distortions of competition on this point
Failure to do this could result in the spectre of inefficient port workers becoming a reality
That would benefit no one
The rapporteur recalls the low level of payments set and accepts the trend of reducing the EU budget 's share of Community G@@ N@@ I@@ /@@ GNP
The very credibility of the budgetary process is also undermined
We are now seeing further problems with defining priorities , such as that given to the Lisbon strategy , or to issues of immigration and asylum
Furthermore , priority is still not being given to Palestine
The view of the immediate future is not as optimistic as might appear from the Commission 's document , however
Will we succeed in ensuring that the dates set for enlargement are observed ?
If they are not observed , many points of the strategy will be just wishful thinking
The objective of stability is also a priority which must be pursued
We know how difficult it is to create all the conditions necessary to ensure stability and we must work to ensure sustainable growth
This is , in short , a report that properly expresses the Union 's political guidelines with a view to including them in the 2004 budget
We continue to object on principle to the idea of Community funds being used to finance European political parties
We have today chosen to vote in favour of the report on a reform of the budgetary procedure
The report contains a number of important measures in the area of the budget
It is proposed , for example , that the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure be abolished
We believe that there is no good reason for such a division
Clearly , Parliament must have influence upon agricultural expenditure too
We support the proposal for making it simpler to move money between different categories of expenditure in the EU budget
That is an important measure for creating a system in which money is used more efficiently in the EU
The report also points out that the rules governing the EU 's own resources must be reviewed
We are , however , completely opposed to a system that could lead to Parliament 's being given influence over how much money is to be allocated to the EU
That concludes the explanations of vote
Excep@@ tionally , Mr Fatuzzo is not here today to give an explanation of vote on behalf of the Italian pensioners
( The sitting was suspended at 1 p
and resumed at 3 p
This was intended to achieve lasting growth , along with full employment , more and better jobs , and greater social cohesion
Eurostat tells us that we currently have almost 14 million unemployed
Official figures indicate that there are 4
There is no doubt that the European employment strategy has achieved successes by coordinating national , regional and local employment policies
I agree with the Council and the Commission in their assessment that the new guidelines should be tightened up for the sake of greater efficiency
We need , above all , evidence of their having been transposed and of resultant changes in labour markets
The tax laws of many Member States are in@@ im@@ ical to enterprise and employment
Far from there being further increases in taxes , these should be reduced
Consumers and enterprises must have the burdens lifted from them , and administrative expenditure must be reduced
We must get back to job creation being worth it in financial terms
Reducing VAT on services up to the end of this year was the right way to go about it
It is always a matter of balance between , on the one hand , greater flexibility , and , on the other , long-term security
I have not conten@@ ted myself with generalised commitments to support for SMEs , but have made very specific demands
Let me , at this point , thank all the groups ' shadow rapporteurs for their constructive suggestions
We learned a great deal together and from each other
We call on the Member States to do more to provide childcare facilities and tax benefits for the people who work in them
Flexibility is also of benefit to the long-term unemployed , to those starting work and to those with few qualifications , who can acquire new employment skills
Too little attention is paid to demographic change and the lack of specialists
They want more training and can take the strain
Experience is a bon@@ us; it cannot be a defect
The presentation of the results was followed by an extended debate between all the European institutions
As a result , the Commission presented a document in January containing a new approach to the Employment Strategy
Basically , the new approach focuses mainly on implementing the Lisbon objectives
Having agreed on the three basic objectives , we then come to the substance of the guidelines
Both Parliament and the Council called for fewer , simpler guidelines focusing more clearly on results
Our objective , therefore , is to cut the number of guidelines , if possible by half , and to articulate them around highly specific priorities
So we have three basic objectives and eleven basic priorities around which the guidelines on employment are structured
We believe , in the light of experience over recent years , that the quantitative approach plays a very important part
Our proposal therefore includes specific sectors which can be used as a basis for discussion and in which Member States can agree on European or specific national targets
Another important point is partnership
The method of administering the procedure for the Employment Strategy does , of course , vary from one country to another
Each country takes a different approach , depending on its culture and on how the social partnership and local authorities are organised
However , the evaluation identifies certain points which are common to every country
This last point brings me to timetabling
In order to implement this coordination , which has been called for on numerous occasions , including in Parliament , we need four different stages
The first stage is to decide on the general guidelines for the strategy on employment and the broad economic policy guidelines at the spring Council
The second is to submit the guidelines as quickly as possible after that , as a package
This means that , once we have the spring Council 's guidelines , the Commission will present a package of guidelines on both economic policy and employment
The third is to approve the guide@@ lin@@ es; this needs to be done as quickly as possible , if possible at the June Council
The fourth , once these guidelines have been approved , is to draw up national action plans and the joint report on employment by the autumn
The debate on the reform of the Employment Strategy started back in July last year
This is very important if we are to avoid overlaps and ensure that one procedure does not take precedence over the other
That is why I find it a courageous report , and , moreover , it is not very politically correct on a number of points
As I said , we are faced with a kind of economic slump
That is always bad news for employment , with unemployment rising , as a rule
In that case , we generally see unemployment among young people increasing more sharply than unemployment as a whole
That is because it is harder for young people to find a job than it has been in the past
The minute the situation suddenly improves , young people are the first to find a job
The minute the situation is less good , however , they are left standing
In order to prevent that happening , and precisely because we can see it coming , we should be focusing on this in particular
That does not mean that we should completely forget about the other groups we have indicated - that is , women and older people
I should now like to turn to the matter of comparisons
At present , unemployment in the European Union is approximately 2
5 % higher than in the United States and Japan , but the differences are not as great as they seem at first glance
Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Austria , Ireland , Denmark , Great Britain and Sweden are doing better than the United States
The other countries are therefore doing somewhat worse
If , however , we look at the differences , that is very alarming
It is precisely for that reason that this policy and these ideas are so important
One cannot help but see that if a country has very high unemployment and this unemployment does not go down , something is not right
There are countries that have historically had high unemployment , whose unemployment is going down
On the other hand , there are other countries that have historically had low unemployment , whose unemployment is rising
This is especially the case if one part of such a country is doing well and another part is not
In Germany , for example , which is of course our greatest concern at the moment , there are states that are simply at the European level
That is a very interesting question
It is not a valid approach to only look at the countries , but also at the regions
That is the way to bring it together
The Lisbon process must be kept on the rails even in difficult times
On behalf of my group , I can tell you that the Commission 's new approach to the employment strategy has been received very favourably in our camp
Increased stability in the employment strategy is indeed necessary
We also agree with the Commission that there should be more cohesion between the coordination processes
It is becoming increasingly the case that the broad economic guidelines are in practice playing the role of overarching instrument
In our opinion , that means that , while the processes must run autonomously , a great deal more coherence is needed between the various political processes
That also has consequences in terms of content , because it means that , in our view , the economic policy must also stimulate economic growth
Therefore , a lot more work must be done towards innovation , research and development , and investment in people
We should therefore like to lend our full support to the intention of the Greek Presidency to activate these processes and give them more continuity
We fully agree that more attention should be paid to an effective implementation of the employment strategy
We must not let this strategy become a paper tiger
For example , we see that there are serious shortcomings in businesses ' training efforts and that people with low skills and older people are treated unequally
That is why we think that the involvement of all the stakeholders is very important
My group thought that the Mann report was reasonably balanced , reflecting our main concerns , just as it came out of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs
We have no intention of tabling any amendments , therefore
the amendments that are now on the table threaten to distort the whole report
This is not , Mr Pronk , a question of political correctness or anything of the sort
In our opinion it is a question of the efficiency of this Parliament
Such a report does not lend itself to national political deliberations or ideological debates on specific points of this or that policy orientation
My group is therefore inclined to reject these amendments
It is , then , also only natural that the two topics be linked , since they are two sides of the same coin
Success in employment policy is crucial to achieving the objective of economic policy
The fact is , moreover , that an economic policy that increases competitiveness and flexibility and so improves the economic incentives for creating jobs is the core of employment policy
Unfortunately , the common employment policy is seen , from the job figures and unemployment statistics , not to be an unqualified success
We are much too far from the ambitious targets set in Lisbon three years ago
No , they were not; but there are tren@@ d-@@ setting countries that do not feel sufficiently bound by the promises
I agree with the proposal you have tabled , Commissioner , for simplifying and clarifying the open coordination of employment policy with a view to having fewer guidelines
These are constructive reforms that have been presented , and I also think it good that we should have better coordination with the common economic policy
Madam President , when Mr Mann 's report was discussed by the committee , many amendments were subject to major debate
There was disagreement over one area in particular , namely the conditions under which small businesses operate , together with their role in employment policy
Two different approaches were thus p@@ itted against each other
The other approach was quite different
It is also precisely this route that my group too wishes to go down
In actual fact , we of course have too many small businesses in Europe
By far the largest number of small businesses is to be found in those countries and regions which are weakest economically and in which unemployment is very high
We have a large number of businesses that can scarcely support one family
We have a large number of businesses that start up with the aid of state subsidies and that immediately disappear once the periods of subsidy have come to an end
We must put our faith in quality
Mr Mann 's report contains a number of constructive proposals for a modern and forward-looking policy of this kind towards small businesses
Mr President , I too would like to thank the rapporteur
The report that eventually came out of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was indeed a reasonable report
However , my group had one major problem with it over the support for the rigidity of the stability and growth pact
Consequently we are going to be supporting the amendment on that which will be coming from another group this afternoon
Amendment 17 concerning GATS
We do not agree that the General Agreement on Trade in Services will be a job engine , either here or in the developing world
That was the subject of the extensive debate that Parliament had on Monday
Too often we see that the poorest people in the worst quality jobs also live in the worst environment
If we are really going to do something to upgrade employment or our social environment , we need to take account of the physical environment
We also agree with a lot that the Commissioner said about the ownership of this employment strategy
It would be very useful if national parliaments debated the national action plans that were put forward by governments
That would be a welcome step forward
You can have a small swe@@ at@@ shop as well as an ethical business and regulation is there to support the latter , not the former
Madam President , Commissioner , there is no doubt that Mr Mann has done an excellent job
The same may be said of incentives to promote employment , as the rapporteur calls them , which are considered to be a different matter from flexibility and bureaucratic relief
The role of the social partners , however , which the rapporteur has rightly emphasised , is a consideration worthy of mention
A further point concerns the knowledge-based society itself , aims and objectives of which we support
We owe all of that to a European political class that has managed to combine the problems of bureaucratic socialism with the problems of ultra-@@ liberalism and globalisation
In other words , we are struggling with the worst of both worlds
Furthermore , it is clear that eastward enlargement will now throw the doors wide open to large-scale de@@ loc@@ alisation and mass immigration
It is clear that the Union 's economic policy of opening up its internal market to global competition is selling off what is left of our labour-intensive industries
Allowing irresponsible free-trade extremists and globalisation fundamentalists to take charge of the future of our economies and our social structures is dangerous
This item is also about allocating greater resources to programmes for combating female unemployment
I want really to focus upon what is in actual fact the biggest issue for Europe , namely the demographic challenge
Item 37 indicates the value of combining working life and family life and of giving more time to children
This report is therefore about seeing the Stockholm European Council 's decision of March 2001 on the demographic challenge as one of the absolutely most important issues for Europe
Item 37 emphasises this extremely clearly
This of course is partly due to a number of demands which have a very specific national character and which do not really belong in the European debate at all
The path towards this goal is undoubtedly a matter of debate
Indeed , Sweden and Denmark have already applied this in principle
Moreover , Mr Mann calls for implementation of the national further training plans to be pushed through
Here too , we agreed that there should be legislation imposing a binding obligation and setting out workers ' rights to further training
Furthermore - and this , of course , is where we cannot agree with him - he calls for indiscriminate tax cuts and wage subsidies
These are not fresh ideas
Nor do they promote the entrepreneurial creativity that we urgently need
Mr President , I should like to make a couple of brief remarks
That was something I just wanted to say on this day when elections are being held in the Netherlands
In any case , I concur with remarks such as those by Mrs Van Lancker with regard to the linking of economic and social policy
In my opinion , we should also adapt the economic policy to the social policy
I also concur with a number of remarks by Mr Pronk regarding the frequently erroneous comparison between the United States and Europe
You have to have a much better , much more careful look at this
I am in agreement with the main objectives of the new employment policy and should like to call attention in particular to the second objective
Looking at the priorities , it is fun@@ ny to see that some eleven remain of the original eighteen guidelines
I think that we have to look very carefully at how to present and systematically secure the new fields , such as immigration and undeclared work
In other words , I think that we need to do some work on this in the coming period
Whatever side of the political divide we come from , we all agree that more needs to be done to achieve a more effective Europe-wide employment strategy
Many of the proposals in Mr Mann 's report and some of the amendments will help towards this final goal
However , we must also learn from the mistakes of the past
In particular , the guidelines need to be simplified and reduced
Appropriate targets have to be put in place to guarantee the delivery of proper results rather than a mere tinkering with figures
We need to create proper conditions for full and stable employment to improve quality and productivity at work and labour market cohesion
We need to ensure that all employment policies are peop@@ le-@@ centred , not merely a response to an urgent need in one or other Member State
Our strategy requires not only that people be given training and skills but also that there be no discrimination between men and women
This year , in particular - the International Year of the Disabled - we should also be working more actively towards integrating people with disabilities into the workforce
We must maintain and improve the incentive to work
The most effective way is by guaranteeing proper wages and ensuring that people can maintain as much of their own earning potential as possible to reduce labour taxes
These issues are exclusively for Member States
If a Member State , or a group of Member States , wishes to follow the best practices of another Member State , then so be it
My last point concerns my own amendment to Paragraph 24
The purpose is to boost consumer confidence through proper corporate social responsibility , which can create and contribute to higher innovation performance
The idea is to distinguish between how an enterprise relates to internal stakeholders , shareholders and employees
Corpor@@ ate social responsibility can also have beneficial effects in terms of building good relationships with consumers , suppliers and others
If we can deal with the question of taxation , we can all support this report
However , the question of taxation has to remain outside the responsibility
We must also focus on clear issues , on adopting global priorities in the medium term and on achieving results
One of these issues is that of active ageing as a response to the demographic challenge , whilst not forgetting young people and the least-favoured social groups
The report rightly highlights the role of the small and medium-sized enterprises in particular
These have indeed been the driving force behind job creation in Europe
Consequently , measures promoting the creation and existence of SMEs will surely have a positive effect both on the quantity and quality of jobs created
we also need a policy that is both durable and flexible
We do not want second-class jobs or des@@ killed casu@@ al work , as you are proposing
We must focus on training and qualifications , and support the most vulnerable categories , which are women , young people and the elderly
Nor do we want a policy that insists on seeing fiscal pressure as the cause of all evils in this matter
Nor do we want deregulation , uncontrolled opening up of the service trade markets , sacrificing all the social acquis on the altar of free competition
If the report were to be amended in the way you are proposing in plenary , we would have to oppose it
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I do not know whether I shall find anything much to add to Mrs Gillig 's superb speech
In this context , the endless calls for social dialogue are a rather surreal figure of speech
Must we prevent ourselves from taking a look at these experiments and drawing the conclusions that , in my opinion , are generally extremely interesting ?
I believe it would be far more interesting to show imagination , rather than to keep tro@@ tting out old-fashioned ideas that we have heard all too often
We must start to show an interest in this kind of debate and initiative
In short , nothing has happened
As will have become apparent from the debate in Parliament , there is too much bureaucracy and there are too many regulations
What we lack is training , better access to capital and a long list of structural changes to enable us to cope successfully in the new knowledge-based economy
The key to progress will be more basic research so that the new knowledge can quickly be converted into exciting , well-@@ paid and interesting jobs
I want to say that Mr Mann 's report is a step in the right direction in promoting economic growth and increasing the number of jobs in the Member States
He emphasises the importance of small and medium-sized businesses and sets out a long list of initiatives that I believe will enhance the process
This line was partially adjusted in committee and the result is more balanced , and that is why , as has been said , we do not support the amendments
I would like to end with a comment
Mrs Bast@@ os rightly upheld the paragraph of the resolution which calls for greater cooperation between universities and research centres
It is a shame that her group has tabled an amendment seeking to replace cooperation with competition
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I do not think I am in danger of being complacent , as figures are not really open to interpretation
I might only be looking at one side of the coin , however
Nonetheless , it is pleasing to note that the number of people unemployed in the European Union has fallen dramatically
The total stood at 17 million in 1997 but by 2002 it was down to 13
The scenario and pace are now quite different
Of course , I have to admit there is another side to this coin
4 % of the unemployed have never actually worked , have lost their job , or face major obstacles in getting back into work
In general , these are older people
At least , they are likely to be too old to benefit from schemes for the young , and too young to be considered for early retirement
Alternatively , they might be young and lack the necessary experience and training
I have already referred to two groups in particular need of protection or initiatives , namely the young and older people who have lost their job
Turning to a third such group , on 8 March we celebrated International Working Women 's Day , and its memory should still be fresh in our minds
Women also need support
It is important to honour the commitment given at the Lisbon Council , namely to ensure that over 60 % of women are in employment by 2010 at the latest
The proposal we are debating today encompasses three main objectives
These are to increase the rate of employment , to improve job quality and to open up the labour market to the most disadvantaged groups in society
2003 is the year of the disabled , and this should be in the forefront of our minds
In addition , the horizontal policies so frequently referred to in the House must permeate all our activities
It is difficult to rank these horizontal policies , but health and safety in the workplace , equality and sustainable development are certainly amongst the most important
It is also vital to ensure the involvement of society as a whole and of all levels of administration , regardless of how close they might be to the citizens
The enlargement countries will be watching our activities with interest too
Mr Mann 's report takes account of all these considerations
The report is to be commended in its original version , and also as it now stands following the improvements made in committee
I congratulate Mr Mann and call for a vote in favour of this report
The Commission 's communication and reform must therefore be more than welcome
Let us hope that the second half of the decade that began in 1997 will actually surpass the first
I must begin by echoing what other Members have said
I do not know whether to start by commenting on Mr Mann 's report or on the amendments to it
Further to the statements made by the rapporteur and by Mr Pronk , I find I am bound to state strong opposition to all the amendments
Mr Mann 's report does indeed contain a number of positive ideas
These enjoyed broad support in committee
Unfortunately , the amendments amount to a strong reaction against the most sensible and balanced ideas of the European strategy for ideological reasons
I should like to focus on the objectives and point out that there can be no valid strategy if the objectives are sc@@ aled down
As the Commissioner stated , the Lisbon objectives are crystal clear
There is no doubt that the objectives for the coming five years are more jobs , better job quality and better social inclusion
Mr Mann , more jobs is not synonymous with full employment
It is not acceptable to maintain that it was over-@@ ambitious to hope to attain the rates of employment set at Lisbon
Similarly , better quality is not synonymous with lower taxation , nor is more social inclusion synonymous with fewer fiscal demands
Public resources will be needed to launch proactive policies and to ensure those in danger of being excluded from the labour market are drawn into it
If these amendments are adopted , I shall therefore be obliged to vote against your report , Mr Mann , along with many other Members in my delegation
But I do not accept the basic thrust of the report that one of the solutions is to strengthen the roles of the social partners
I am all for social dialogue , but this should be between employees and employers within their companies
So within the social partners their voice goes virtually unheard , and yet the social partners presume to speak for them
A German minister was quoted as saying ' when it becomes necessary to drain the sw@@ amp , you do n't stand around asking the fro@@ gs '
With unemployment approaching 5 million in that country , the sw@@ amp is getting bigger and the need for change is very clear
So I am all for social justice and social inclusion , but the biggest enemy of both is unemployment
Governments need to do what is necessary to address this
Cl@@ inging on to outdated concepts does not help@@ ; strengthening the role of the social partners simply leads to more paralysis
If some countries wish to persist in this , it is of course up to them
But please , rapporteur , please , Commissioner , do not inflict such concepts on the rest of us
Unfortunately , the current labour market is not dynamic enough to create new jobs
6 % compared to 8
We also note that exploitation is rife among women , with over 250 000 women working at home with absolutely no social protection
At the same time , the black market is flourishing , relying heavily on hundreds of thousands of mainly female foreigners who are left out of labour and unemployment statistics
We are also delighted , Commissioner , with the importance you have attached to gender mainstreaming in all sectors
However , it is clear from the statistics on the number of women in work that the policies already being applied require greater momentum and evaluation
Most importantly , quantifiable , qualitative and quantitative targets need to be introduced at both European and national level
I hope the forthcoming spring Council will accept your proposals and that we shall have new national employment plans by the autumn , as you said in your speech
Mr President , as we have discussed the individual subjects broached by the honourable Members on several occasions , I have just three brief comments to make
The first concerns the objectives of the spring Council
It is important that the Greek Presidency has made employment a priority at the spring Council
This will be the second time since Lisbon that employment has been one of the Council 's priorities
As far as the first target is concerned , we are clearly behind schedule
On the second issue , the positive evaluation of the employment strategy notwithstanding , numerous reforms need speeding up
My second point has to do with discrimination
My third point has to do with women
For the first time , more women than men have entered the labour market
I shall of course be insisting on gender mainstreaming in all measures and priorities
The debate is closed
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
Mr President , this is indeed an important issue
What is at stake , after all , is the stability and development of our single currency , the euro
That is a relatively small and manageable body
Every member has full and unrestricted speaking and voting rights
We can assume that sooner or later , other countries will join as well
The Council has now asked the ECB to draw up its own proposal on this issue
Under pressure of time , a proposal has been drafted which really is not acceptable
I could do so , but it would take about ten minutes
Of course , this system is not remotely transparent , especially since a rotation system would then be introduced
This will mean that there will be massive debates about the agenda
What is more , the details of this rotation system still have to be ham@@ me@@ red out by the Central Bank 's Governing Council
we are not under any real pressure of time
Let the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference , put forward a new and better proposal
It will be 2006 at the earliest , and most probably 2008 - in other words , four years - before any of the new Member States joins the euro
So take time to work out a new , transparent and viable proposal
We have presented two options in this context
We have said that even if weighting is needed , there should be no rotation system
We have also said that in the long term , you really do need to get down to br@@ ass t@@ acks
If confidence in the euro has increased to an adequate extent in a few years ' time , the academics ' proposal could be adopted
This entails differentiating between short-term operational decisions and long-term institution@@ al@@ /@@ strategic decisions
Mr President , in this my first intervention I should like to say a few words about the Commission 's ruling
I shall outline our differences with Mr Friedrich 's report and refer also to our final position
Any reform of the Central Bank must comply with four conditions
Firstly , decisions have to be taken quickly and efficiently
Secondly , decision-making bodies have to act taking account of the interests of the Euro@@ zone as a whole
Thirdly , the system has to be impartial and fair to present and future Members
Fourthly , the markets and the public as a whole have to be aware of transparency
This is crucial to understanding the operation of the system
The model advocated by the Central Bank does help to ensure efficiency
Nonetheless , the key feature of the Central Bank 's proposal is based on the enabling clause in the Treaty of Nice
It is therefore based on the premise that the system legally in force may not be modified
I should like to return to this when I have heard what Mr Friedrich has to say
Such improvement should be substantial
It should involve adjusting the method of classifying countries into groups
There is no need to develop new types of weighting
The Bank 's own classification should be used instead
This takes account on the one hand of population and , on the other , of GDP
Improvements are called for , however , to clarify the frequency and order of rotation in this type of voting
This is the thinking behind our proposals
Having considered the proposals in the report , we believe them to be ambitious , but find they pose a fundamental problem
They envisage interpretations going beyond the enabling clause
We differ on this in two respects
Turning to the most significant first , the report rejects the Central Bank 's model and presents a counter-@@ proposal
The latter is no doubt technically valid , but it is not in line with the enabling clause
The notion of a double key , involving double weighting of the vote , is not in line with the clause either
This is because according to legislation currently in force , every Member of the Council must have a voting right
Such adjustments are therefore better suited to a different context , to a more ambitious position , like the one you yourself referred to , Mr Friedrich
The decision we have to take in the near future is whether or not to go ahead , following the accelerated procedure , and adopt the Central Bank 's proposal
A decision must be made within the next few weeks if it is to comply with the enabling clause
Were this to be the case , a unanimous vote in the Council of Ministers would be required
Nonetheless , the Commission agrees with the House that a more thorough reform is called for
Such reform should go further than what is envisaged under the enabling clause
We should be prepared to tackle it at the next Intergovernmental Conference on the basis of a different model
As has been rightly pointed out , this can be done at the Intergovernmental Conference , but not under the current enabling clause
Against this background , we welcome the fact that the ECB has put forward a proposal unanimously
There is absolutely no reason why this decision should be adopted hastily , as the rapporteur has already pointed out
We can continue in familiar fashion and prepare a fundamental reform with the next Intergovernmental Conference
The fundamental reform which is necessary , and which we intend , differs in one key respect
everyone should remain on bo@@ ard@@ ; there should be no rotation princi@@ ple@@ ; in a common Europe , everyone should have a say in the ECB
The solution is not rotation but weighting
This weighting could be based on the weighting in the Council , but must build primarily on economic and financial market policy parameters
Rather than more complexity , we want greater transparency
We do not want new forms of discrimination , but more integration and therefore greater clarity for the public
Take us up on our offer , which is to prepare a comprehensive reform instead of an over-@@ hasty short-term solution
the proposal submitted for reform of the voting in the ECB Governing Council is not a step in the right direction
It is because it was developed from the perspective of national representation , not a European perspective , that it must be rejected
What we actually need is an ambitious European solution
Here , no Member of this House can be neutral , for the way in which such a key macroeconomic partner arrives at its decisions is important
We must therefore know how the decisions are shaped , but there is still time for that at the next Intergovernmental Conference
Speci@@ fying that representation should be on a national basis conflicts with the aim of an integrated monetary policy
Should we differentiate between monetary policy and operational decisions ?
Where should the strategic decisions be taken ?
This is possible with a unanimous amendment to the Treaty
I really do think it is important for us to make this distinction , simply because it is necessary
As the European Parliament , we also have a particular interest in doing so because we attach importance to transparency
Like our colleagues in the USA , we want to be able to follow how decisions are taken and also how weigh@@ tings occur in the discussions
I am all in favour of anonymity , so that no names are mentioned , as in the USA
Our key concern is to gain an overview of the various perspectives on monetary policy
This will remove confusion and insecurity , create the clarity that is required , especially at present , and underline the Central Bank 's democratic duty of accountability
The ECB proposal would create a third class of Member State with fewer chances of voting and , ou@@ trage@@ ously , only candidate countries would be in this inferior grouping
This is a proposal designed to protect the vested interests of the eurozone 's existing central bankers
They are just trying to pull the ladder up behind them
This would be retro@@ gres@@ sive and would undermine the collegiate outlook of the Governing Council
The Convention should look at this issue so that it can be discussed as openly as possible and with full consultation of all the interested parties
I believe that we must somehow go back to square one and that the Commission must produce its own proposal , taking Parliament 's recommendations into consideration
The ECB will be consulted , but it cannot be allowed to be the promoter of this decision which concerns it so closely
We want the Council of Heads of State or Government to devise and adopt a different model , with other weighting criteria being used in this context
The draft on changes to the voting modalities proposed by the ECB Governing Council and endorsed by the European Commission , is unnecessary and unjust
It is unnecessary because we are certainly not under the time pressure that you , Commissioner , have described
Summer 2006 , in a best-@@ case scenario , is theoretically the earliest that we will achieve a figure of 15 eurozone members
We therefore do have enough time
In a single currency zone , it is essential for every member of the ECB Governing Council to have a permanent and equal vote
To ensure that this is guaranteed in future too , and thus to retain the existing rules , we have proposed that other weighting criteria should be used
Our colleague Dr Friedrich has already spoken about this
My proposal to use population as one of these criteria has not found support among a majority in the committee so far this time
Since the rules have to be agreed unanimously , there will be no movement without a compromise
The rotation system , Commissioner , is a bad compromise
I have proposed that in addition to a simple majority of votes , at least half the population of the Member States of the eurozone must be represented
This will avoid majority decisions being taken in the ECB Governing Council without taking sufficient account of the economic realities in the European Union
The history of the European Union does not provide a single example of an alliance of L@@ illi@@ pu@@ tians against the G@@ ulli@@ vers of Europe
The Stability and Growth Pact was invented to establish budgetary discipline in the so-called ' Club Med ' countries in order to guarantee the external value of the euro
The Pact is respected by the small countries , but far less by the large countries
G@@ ulli@@ ver 's syndrome , however , leads some capital cities to believe that govern@@ ors from small countries might be led to impose a lax monetary policy
The result of all these fears is the ECB proposal to restrict the number of govern@@ ors deciding on monetary policy
Why , therefore , this proposal to change the voting system ?
We are told that it will no longer be possible to vote when there are 25 Members
This is not , therefore , the real reason behind the proposed reform
In fact , the five large States , which represent approximately three quarters of the Community GDP , want to be able to define monetary policy themselves
As regards this latter point , the Friedrich report is in line with the unanimous proposal of the Governing Council
However , there are still some doubts in relation to all these proposals
As this is not a matter of urgency , why not grant us an additional reflection period ?
Mr President , I would also like to respond to Mr Della Vedova that , according to the ECB proposals , Poland would still be ahead of Luxembourg
Mr Friedrich 's report is along the right lines but , in common with others in Parliament , I wonder why there is all this hurry
We should stop and reflect and produce a securely founded proposal for the next intergovernmental conference
It is a requirement of democracy that voting rules be fairly simple and comprehensible
Ordinary people too must in fact be able to understand them and how they work
The principle should be one of ' one member , one vote '
As Mr Huhne pointed out , the important requirement of efficiency can be met in an enlarged EU
Commissioner , we must prevent an unduly divided Europe
A division into A , B and even C teams is not acceptable
The ECB must demonstrate greater openness , with public reporting of discussions and votes
That is a requirement that cannot be abandoned
Finally , we must in fact also strengthen Parliament 's role
Mr President , I want to thank the rapporteur , Mr Friedrich , for his sterling work on this matter
The present rules must be reformed
Everyone seems to agree that reform is necessary
It is not , however , entirely clear what that reform is to look like
That means that , in the extremely near future , not all Member States ' voices will be heard
There will be a system in which not everyone participates , but which is nonetheless unwieldy and complicated
The rotation system will make it difficult to demand accountability , because it will become almost impossible to decide which individual or individuals is or are responsible for a decision
I think that this will be important for the small countries
It will also be significant for the new Member States
Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we knew that this matter would arise
For a long time , it was too early to discuss it
The report was by Mr Brok
Today , it would be hasty to take a decision solely on the basis of the work of the European Central Bank
That is the reality of the debate we are holding here
Essentially , I believe that the Convention can undo what the Treaty of Nice has done
Essentially , I also believe that we should examine these proposals and try to extract what we consider to be the main points
I believe we can extract some information , some criteria , from the experience gained by the Central Bank in its short life
The second criterion , which the Chairman of our committee , Mrs Chris@@ ta Randzio-Plath , has mentioned , concerns the transparency of decisions within decision-making bodies
The third criterion concerns the Bank 's ability to define monetary policy in the interests of the whole euro zone
These proposals affect the equality of the Member States
Must those in the second and the third groups simply keep quiet in the discussion or stand aside while the great of the earth cast their votes ?
No , Mr President , I think that the situation as we know it at present is perfectly all right
The rapporteur rightly says that we still have plenty of time to look calmly at a better system
My own country would find the whole situation even more disagreeable
The Netherlands is one of the countries that have conducted a strong monetary policy for years
Whilst I fervently hope that the United Kingdom will join at some stage , it is a rather sorry state of affairs when it entails consequences of this kind
Countries that have for some years been sa@@ wing more or less vigorously at the legs of European monetary stability are seeing themselves rewarded
It is nonetheless inconceivable , Mr President , that we throw away the euro in this way
The work of the European Central Bank 's main decision-making body must be reformed in order for effective decision-making to be possible after enlargement
We all want to make decision-making on monetary policy more effective , but the system must be more transparent and comprehensible
The existing version of Article 10 of the Statute of the European Central Bank states that the ECB Governing Council takes its decisions by a simple majority
Proposals for decisions are not , however , put to the vote before there is consensus in the discussions
According at least to the statements made in Parliament by the President of the ECB , Wim Duisenberg , consensus means more than a majority but less than unanimity
For the ECB to be able to react more swiftly to market changes it should practise majority voting
From this point of view , it is not sensible for the voting procedures to be made complicated and off-@@ putting with even less voting happening than before
Moreover , the rotation model being proposed by the ECB violates several principles which both Parliament and the central bank govern@@ ors themselves used to consider of vital importance
The preparatory work to reform the ECB 's voting procedures is to be postponed until the Intergovernmental Conference takes place
Two proposals by Parliament are worthy of support
We hope that Ecofin takes Parliament 's opinion into consideration when it makes its decision
Certainly , our German rapporteur relinquished his initial proposal to give each eurozone country a vote in the ECB Governing Council but to counterbalance this exclusively with the represented population
I would remind you that the ECB Governing Council examined a similar proposal by the Bundes@@ bank during its lengthy deliberations and finally rejected it
That would be an indictment of the Member States ' politicians and their central bankers
Ultimately , a currency is influenced by economic and financial strength rather than by a country 's population
The ECB 's proposal reflects this truism
Another reason why I did not endorse the so-called ' compromise ' amendment is that it would lead to what amounts to renationalisation
Mr President , I shall be brief
Two different issues have emerged during this debate
The first concerns the system proposed by the Central Bank , based on the implementation of the enabling clause
The question arises as to whether it is logical or not and whether a better system could be devised
The second issue concerns what a better system might involve
It might be the system detailed in Mr Friedrich 's report or it might be different again
What we are concerned with at present , however , is the enabling clause established at Nice
The governments are referring to it authorising the Central Bank to present a proposal which must be unanimously approved
They are also referring to it in connection with a Commission proposal , which must also be unanimously approved
Such a system would have to involve rotation
Clearly , a system of rotation means that not everyone would be involved in everything
The issue of the nature of the system of rotation then arises
There is no doubt that the model presented by the Central Bank does provide for a weighting of the countries based on their respective financial and economic significance
As a result , the smaller countries are given a significant role
The Commission is of the opinion , however , that there is not sufficient justification for the proposed system of rotation
The Commission therefore proposes adjusting the system of rotation only
All the Commission has done is to propose using the current Central Bank criteria to define its voting system
As I said , all this means is using the system the Bank has in place at present
This system will of course involve a change
Not everyone will be present
The enabling clause does however provide for this
It would not make sense to table a further proposal for a different system of rotation , instead of suggesting an amendment to the Central Bank 's proposal
It has been argued in the House that the enabling clause will not resolve all the problems , and that a more ambitious stance is called for
I sympathise with these views
The Commission has adopted a similar position in some cases
It would resolve the potential problem of the transition
It is worth remembering that any alternative model would also require unanimity and ratification , and would not be easy to implement
The debate is closed
The vote will take place next Thursday
( The sitting was suspended at 5
m and resumed at 5
Ladies and gentlemen , I should like to inform you of a slight change in the order of business
The next item will be the statement by the Commission , and the debate will continue until 5
Question Time will follow at 5
Mr President , I will be extremely brief , just making a few points regarding the document presented today on proximity policy
This is an extremely important document which clarifies our proposals for European and Mediterranean relations after enlargement
The reference framework we have outlined in the communication complements rather than replaces the relationship the Union has with individual countries or groups of countries
In other words , the principle of differentiation will apply in this case too
The objective is twofold
These action plans will include objectives , timeframes , procedures and monitoring mechanisms applying equally to both parties
Mr President , the Commissioner obviously wanted to say something just now , and perhaps I can ask him a question at the same time
I fully endorse the proposals that Mr Prodi has outlined here
what will be the institutional framework for all this ?
You mentioned the financial instruments and the treaties with neighbouring countries
are any specific institutional arrangements required ?
The@@ ore@@ tically , after all , there is still the European Conference
There are various possibilities
In connection with the Mediterranean region , we have discussed the option of establishing closer parliamentary cooperation as well
Will the European Conference be revived ?
Will there be specific responsibility within the Commission for this area of cooperation ?
Will it remain with Commissioner Patten ?
These are the questions that interest me
Perhaps you could explain the situation in more detail
The honourable Member will see from the communication we are publishing today the practical ways in which we try to give expression to this notion
We have tried it in the past
That is not the subject of this communication
The simple answer to his question is that there is no disagreement
The Commission believes that this is a responsibility for the whole Commission and that responsibilities will have to be shared between us
I have a long list of Members before me
The Commissioner will reply once the three Members have posed their questions
Mr President , I have listened with great interest to the Commissioner 's statement on the enlargement countries
I am sure if they join the Union , they will wish to ensure transparency and accountability in all the institutions
This afternoon the Commission spokesman said that the Commission now had no plans to publish that note
This is not relevant to this afternoon 's debate
Mr Prodi is welcome to respond if he so wishes , but I would urge Members to keep to the order of business
the document will be made public as per the interinstitutional agreement
Mr President , I have followed the Commission President 's introduction very closely and have also read the speech he made on the same subject in Brussels in December
That I understand perfectly well and that is no criticism of Mr Prodi either
There is a ring of friends in which Morocco and Russia will be treated on the same terms , in the same way
Ukraine and Belarus might become members in the future for example , while we cannot imagine the same of Russia
I should like to endorse Mr Lagendijk 's question
I understand perfectly well what the Commission is doing and also what priority it wants to give its policy with regard to the countries around us
In this Parliament we shall be returning in detail to the announcement that the Commission is making today
I really only have one question
The objective of course is to prevent the creation of a new divide , a new Iron Curtain , in Europe
Given what is currently happening in those countries , I think that this is the only way to prevent a new divide in Europe
If we look eastwards , we might consider granting membership to the Re@@ public@@ s of Ukraine and Georgia
The same may be said of Norway , to the North , while , to the West , the Atlantic is in itself already a border
I will respond very briefly to the three related questions
However , clearly , this does not resolve the issue raised in the last question
Membership is something different
There is no longer an iron curtain
There is no exclusion any more
There are Member countries , but countries which have a relationship of increasing active cooperation with the countries around them , with the ring of friends
This will undoubtedly be a key issue for the future after enlargement and the accession of ten new countries
I would like to ask two questions
I think this is an important point
My second question relates to the Balkans
I know that a highly differentiated approach is essential when considering the Balkan countries and that some of them will be able to join the European Union earlier than others
However , the other countries will still need a long period of internal development
Perhaps the Commission could review this position once again
Mr President , the general framework set out by the President of the Commission for relations with other countries following enlargement generally has my backing
However , general principle policies do tend to fail in practice
One of the central issues in the neighbouring countries is what will happen at the borders
Will there be new , decentralised instruments to facilitate practical cross-border cooperation ?
Will the border arrangements be eased , or will the borders lead to a real and tangible division by separating ethnic groups and sever@@ ing existing relations ?
What interests me is what the Commission 's strategy says about this issue
What form will the financial instrument take ?
Will it be a centralised instrument , as is currently the case , with the problems that we have , or will it be a decentralised instrument ?
Mr President , I can answer the three questions on the principle of work@@ -sharing
He raised a couple of points
Firstly , what we want to provide is a coherent global framework
However , we recognise that one cannot argue that there should be a one-size-fits-all policy
We must have a policy that is able to accommodate the different levels of economic development and of commitment to our value system
Therefore I hope that there is coherence which is sufficiently flexible to ensure that the policy works
He also referred to the Balkans
We have specifically excluded from this communication the countries that are involved in the stabilisation and association process , i
As the President has said , I am sure there will be a debate in due course on the geographical limits of the European Union
The President was making speeches about this around three and a half years ago
However , this is not the time or the document for that debate
That will be the policy that we continue
However , we do not seek to resolve the question of membership for those countries of the European Union in this document
Finally , I am pleased to have the opportunity to answer the honourable Member 's question on this because it is one we have discussed in the past
She quite sensibly asks about coherence in our financial instruments for dealing with cross-border issues
I can assure her that she will find in our document the proposal for a neighbourhood instrument , which will deal with the sort of problems she has referred to
Mr President , I was unaware that British Members of this House had a reputation for being ver@@ bo@@ se
The President of the Commission introduced the communication in broad outline , so perhaps I could ask Commissioner Patten about two points of detail since he has touched on them
I see the President of the Commission is no@@ dding , so that will cut down the time for his answer
Will Commissioner Prodi re@@ tract his statement - if it is true - that Ukraine is no more European than New Zealand ?
It was clearly seen by the Ukrain@@ ians as a geographical nonsense and a signal to their government that they were much better off making their bed with the Russian bear
Fortunately Russia does not want to join the European Union , but Ukraine does
Can the Commission provide more funds to combat illegal immigration and border flows through these countries , irrespective of our disapproval of their governments in office at the moment ?
Mr President , President of the Commission , I support and welcome the Commission 's statement which expresses the political desire to build closer relations with neighbouring countries
I feel , however , that the issue of borders constitutes an element of discord in this climate of rapprochement
We have established a series of measures relating to relations with third countries , particularly our neighbours , in order to integrate the management of the flow of migrants
In my opinion , these measures serve to promote the establishment of detention zones in these neighbouring countries both within and on the borders of Europe
I would therefore urge you to consider the risks currently involved
Mr President , we are in some danger of be@@ gging the question
The current enlargement round depends on the outcome of eight referendums which have yet to be held across central and eastern Europe
Mr President , I think the House is going to have the benefit of the President after the External Affairs Commissioner has made one or two points
Firstly , I should like to assure Mr Beazley that there is no question of us seeking to create another iron curtain in Europe
Indeed , part of the intention of this communication is to prevent any notion of a fortress Europe being created with the 25 Member States
When one talks about easing visa regimes , it is important to consider the conditions under which interior ministers are likely to regard that as a tolerable option
There are a number of conditions precedent to any serious discussion of visas
We have the democratic process to go through , as the honourable Member said a moment ago , but the simple answer is ' yes , we are '
A number of applicant countries , for example Poland with its recent discussion document on the eastern dimension , have made very sensible and thoughtful proposals
I am aware of Mr Tannock 's concern about the Ukraine which he has expressed on a number of occasions
I would wish that we were able to have a closer and more ben@@ ign relationship with Belarus
It is not our fault that does not exist
The honourable Member knows the style , objectives and policies of the regime in Belarus which led to the unfortunate visa ban not long ago
We do not want any country on our borders to be isolated by its own will , or by the will of its regime
I have attempted to answer the honourable Member 's point about a buffer zone
One has to take account of all the borders of other countries
We are not just talking about commercial , economic or even geo@@ strategic interests
For many of us the case for enlargement is a moral one
The honourable Member should not worry too much if we think it is worth expressing that case as vigorously and as comprehensively as possible
Just two further comments , for the Commissioner has answered almost all the questions in full
Membership of the Union means sharing specific political objectives too , sharing roots and identities , sharing much more than just democratic sentiments
This was the point I made with regard to New Zealand
I have never said that New Zealand is more European than Ukraine
However , there are geographical and historical considerations and political goals that a country must share in order to become a Member of the Union
It is therefore clear that this possibility must be conferred where these goals are identified and consolidated and are shared by ourselves as well as the countries involved
That is why I am anxious for the debate on the Union 's borders to be opened
Clearly , this can only be achieved with the ring of friends , while we know that immigrants are now coming to Europe even from very distant countries
It is much easier to achieve this objective where there is cooperation than where such cooperation is lacking
The debate is closed
The next item is Question Time
The following questions are addressed to the Commission
Will the Commission kindly confirm that these reports are incorrect , because such a deal would conflict with the Union 's basic principle of free movement for its citizens ?
The Commission is not aware of the United Kingdom press reports to which the honourable Member refers
As far as any enforced limit on the number of foreign players is concerned , I should like to recall the following
This was confirmed by the Court in its now famous 1995 judgment in the Bo@@ sman case
As the author is not present , Question No 51 , 52 and 53 lapses
Now that the Commission has studied this plan , can it certi@@ fy that it is consistent with the ' acquis communautaire ' ?
Does it intend to communicate its considered opinion to Parliament and , if so , when ?
Mr President , the honourable Member will of course be aware that his very important and interesting oral question has sadly been overtaken by events over the last 24 hours
I would therefore , with his permission , like to take this opportunity to inform you about the latest developments
Notwithstanding the European Union 's preference for a political solution , the Commission confirms that the accession process will continue as planned in line with the existing timetable
All the preparatory legal steps to enable this to take place have already been taken
The Commission notes and endorses the UN Secretary-General 's statement that the peace plan will stay on the table
The Commission is also ready to support all further endeavours in this context
The Commission encourages all the sides concerned , including Turkey in particular , to work actively to achieve a solution
The Commission underlines its solidarity with all Cypriots and appreciates the courage with which the Turkish Cypriots have expressed their European convictions
I have to say very clearly that the Cyprus problem is part and parcel of these political criteria for accession
We have also expressed this unequivocally in the accession partnership with Turkey
I find it very difficult to imagine how , in such a situation , the Commission could issue a positive opinion on starting accession negotiations with Turkey
It is very important for the United Nations plan to remain on the table
the most recent version of the United Nations plan was an extremely favourable offer , especially for the Turkish Cypriots
I am firmly convinced that there will never be a better offer or a better solution for the Turkish Cypriots than this one
That is why it is extremely important from the point of view of the Turkish Cypriots for the United Nations to say that the plan will stay on the table
We can only warmly welcome this
Commissioner , allow me a brief comment , if you will , before the supplementary question
I am not just talking about resolving the Cyprus problem , I am talking about dealing with the occupation
Will the European Union accept responsibility for liberating the occupied part of Cyprus ?
Mr Alyssandrakis , I do not agree with you that Cyprus ' accession , in the form currently proposed , will mean a de jure division of the island
But this is not tantamount to recognising two Cypriot states
From a purely legal point of view , the whole of Cyprus will become a Member of the European Union
In practice , Community law will not be able to be applied in part of the territory of Cyprus for as long as there is no political solution
We would not need to hold further negotiations
Neither would another Treaty be required , or renewed ratification
All of these matters are settled in the protocol , which is part of the Act of Accession
What can the Commission do to improve the situation ?
That is the only thing that we can do
At the end of the day it is also the only thing that will help
and the debate was still in full swing
I then went to another meeting
I really would therefore cra@@ ve your indulgence
I would therefore ask you to call my question again
The question has lapsed and the Rules of Procedure do not leave any other option since that would amount to setting a precedent
I understand your argument , but I cannot do anything , either for you or for Mr Salafranca who is now going to speak
I will give the floor to Mr Salafranca for a point of order; but , for example , Mr Lamy has already left
I know that we have started late , because Mr Prodi arrived late
But the Rules of Procedure lay down that the questions lapse
Mr President , I am very glad that you know what I am going to say , because I did not intend to say what you have suggested
The speaker was not present and Mr Lamy did not wait very long , because I ran into him leaving
Thank you for very much improving on what I thought you were going to say
It is always important that the President can be mistaken in his judgments
You have many reasons and you have explained them to me
I will ask the Commission to answer these questions in writing given the extraordinary circumstances , but there will be no oral reply
firstly , Commissioner Verheugen is still here
Secondly - and this is also an important point - you made an exception at the last part-session
I will check in the Minutes to see which Member was concerned
I have a very clear rec@@ ol@@ lection of this precedent being set
Thirdly , I should like to say that I would request that Question Time begin , as in previous years , at 5
That was the practice in this House for almost 20 years and it was something that we could rely on
Either you are liberal in both cases or strict in both cases
I would ask that this be the last point of order , since we are going to spend more time on this than we would have done answering the questions
I will present it again for the next part-session since I would prefer there to be a debate in the Chamber
But you will remember that I said that I was not setting a precedent
What action will the Commission now take to ensure free competition and an equal market in the Czech Republic ?
Mr President , Mr Crowley , the point you raise in your oral question corresponds exactly to the subject of a formal complaint that has been submitted to us
The formal complaint came from the Media Observatory Czech Republic , and has been endorsed by the company Media Pr@@ int & K@@ app@@ a Pres@@ seg@@ ros@@ so
It stated that alleged violations of EC competition law had been observed in the Czech Republic
And I can tell you that immediately afterwards I had the opportunity to raise this issue with the Czech Government at the very highest level
Nevertheless , the Commission services have contacted the Czech competition supervision authorities
Czech is a difficult language
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his brief response
However , Commissioner , you did not answer the basic aspects of the question
Mr Crowley , the different roles that we play here explain our different accounts of the situation
As a Member of Parliament , you are of course free to express a political judgment
As a Member of the Commission , I obviously cannot make a political assessment of a case when the legal proceedings are not yet concluded
I must therefore say that I simply do not know today whether we do in fact have a breach of competition law on our hands
That is the connection
Incidentally , if this had happened after accession it would not have made any difference
The Commission is therefore already doing what you asked me to do at the end of your statement
We are acting on this matter
In late January 2003 , the Centre for Re@@ productive Rights published an investigative report confirming that forced sterilisation was being practised on Roma women in the Slovak health-@@ care system
Mrs Van Lancker , yes , I must say that this is a particularly depressing question
I also found the reports to which you refer deeply disturbing
I read the report on the alleged forced sterilisation of women from the Roma minority in the Slovak Republic with great concern and consternation
I am very pleased to be able to tell you that the Slovak Government responded immediately and without hesitation
The Deputy Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic responsible for human rights issues acted straight away to instigate the necessary steps under criminal law
A special investigation team was set up
This investigation team is supported by the Home Affairs Minister 's advisor on Roma issues
This Home Office advisor for Roma issues himself belongs to the Roma minority
In addition , the government has invited the Vice-@@ Chair@@ person of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly 's Committee on Health to the Slovak Republic on a fact-finding mission
I can assure you that the Commission will closely monitor the progress of the investigations
Mr President , I thank the Commissioner for the steps that he has already taken in this matter
If he will allow me , I will shortly be handing him a copy of the investigation
So I am really shocked by the Slovak Government 's response to the effect that these practices do not go on
The fact is that , at the moment , it is the complainant who is in the dock
Mr President , Mrs Van Lancker , you have clearly misunderstood me
At any rate your supplementary question does not reflect what I said
I did not say that the Slovak Government had dismissed the accusations as untrue
If the Slovak Government were to say that there was no truth in these accusations then it would not need to order an investigation
I would ask you not to be too quick to condemn another country
So far , in my opinion , there is no proof that this is a systematic state practice
Instead the suspicion that is uppermost in my mind is that what we have here are individual cases of abuse , admittedly of the grav@@ est kind
I must draw your attention to the fact that the Commission does not have any executive power in the countries that will be joining us
I really must insist on stating here that the Slovak Government responded immediately and has complied with all of our requests without hesitation
Mr President , I would like to thank the Commissioner for his answer and I would like to congratulate Mrs Van Lancker for bringing this forward
What I saw was that , despite the commitments of the government , the discrimination continues , partly because it seems to be ingrained in the society and almost institutionalised
As a criterion for membership of the Union , is respect for minority languages and cultures being seriously independently monitored and if so by whom and how ?
How is the Commission responding to any criticisms that may be coming up ?
There is barely no other issue either that I myself , and the Commission as a whole , are working on as intensively as this one
It is just that it is not as noticeable in the figures because there are not as many of them in the Member States
The crucial point here is whether the constitution , the judicial system and the state administration system in the future Member States really do discriminate against the Roma or not
What we do find is deeply rooted , traditional discrimination in society , which in some parts of these countries has taken on really tragic proportions
However , I must repeat that this is nothing new
Our efforts have focused on ensuring that these countries develop a strategy to reduce the discrimination against the Roma
We have made it a political precondition for the conclusion of the enlargement negotiations for such strategies to exist and be in force
Neither can we say that there is absolutely no discrimination in the present Member States
Instead we say that European Community law requires measures to be taken to put an end to this discrimination
That is the situation that we find in these countries
In its pre-accession instruments the Commission addressed the needs of the Roma minorities in a big way
I never let a visit to these countries go by without addressing this problem directly and on the spot
Mr President , I should like to thank the Commissioner very much for his answers
He really is very convincing on this issue
I should also , however , like to thank the questioner for even raising this matter
I would be interested to talk to this woman in person
Perhaps it would not be without interest for the Commission either to hear a personal account of the situation on a one-to-one basis
If it did then the Commission would be very grateful to have this opportunity to receive information of this kind first hand
We shall now proceed to the second part of this Question Time , during which Commissioner Fischler will respond
Guarantee of food distribution to disadvantaged groups
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the question posed by Mr Staes concerns the distribution of food to those in need in Belgium
This is clearly a matter for the Member States , so , in this case , it is a matter for the Belgian authorities
The funds that were provided for the 2002 programme in Belgium were no lower than in 2001
On the contrary , funding was increased from around EUR 2
Mr President , Commissioner , I am rather surprised by your answer , because it is of course all a matter of juggling with figures
All I know is that these food distribution organisations are man@@ ned by people who are highly committed , very socially aware , and also well disposed towards Europe
In response you said that just as much food is being distributed as before and then we have the disconcerting assessment that in fact 750 tonnes less are being distributed
Mr Staes , in my statement I was talking about amounts of money and not about tonnes
I also said , however , that you need to bear three different things in mind here
The only way of finding this out is , however , by cont@@ acting the Belgian authorities
We then leave it up to the Belgian State to divide these resources amongst the individual charitable organisations in accordance with its particular priorities
Question No 58 by D@@ ir@@ k Sterckx , which has been taken over by Mr
C@@ alcul@@ ation of a ' fishing day ' to limit the fishing effort in accordance with Regulation 23@@ 4@@ 1/@@ 2002
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the problem raised by Mr Sterckx in his question is one of which the Commission is very well aware
it is true that the definition of fishing days in the temporary recovery plan for cod is very inflexible
We accept this and are working on amending Annex X@@ V@@ II because in this way we can resolve the problem
I can also tell you that we invited all those with responsibilities in this sector to Brussels on Monday morning
We discussed this issue with representatives of the Member States on Monday and also today
We are sure that we will find a solution to this problem that takes account of the practical situation
You say that you are expecting a result to be achieved
when are we going to do something concrete ?
What kind of result have you achieved with the agreements that you have made during the meetings today and yesterday ?
Mr Ver@@ me@@ er , if you wish I can be even more specific
We are not putting off dealing with this problem; we want to change it straight away
We were simply waiting until we had met with those involved , the representatives of the fishing sector
It goes without saying that this is something that we intend to change within the next few weeks
How can you justify this to the fishermen of Scotland ?
Mr President , the question that Mr Purvis has raised is actually completely unrelated to the issue that we have been discussing here
Turning now specifically to industrial fishing , I can only say that we have been working on this issue for years
We were told that this is only true to a very limited extent
In addition , you will also see from the stock surveys that the sand eel stocks continue to be very large and are not in decline
These stocks are in fact st@@ able; we do not have a problem there
There is one problem with industrial fishing and that is the risk of cod being caught as a by-@@ catch
Will they too receive aid based on historical rights ?
Has the Commission forgotten young farmers ?
All eligible farmers , including of course young farmers , who have already received direct payments under the old system , have an equal claim
Furthermore , under Article 49 of our proposal , these claims can be passed on , either through specific be@@ qu@@ ests or by anticipating the line of succession
This provision takes account of customary practice in Europe when a holding is taken over by young farmers
In addition the proposal also specifically accommodates new farmers
Article 45 provides for a national reserve in the Member States
Reference amounts can be allocated from this reserve for the single payment to farmers who started their farming activity only after 31 December 2000
The possible cases when hardship pertains are described in more detail in Paragraph 4 of the relevant article
Thank you very much , Commissioner , for that very positive and illuminating reply , at a time when there is great uncertainty in the countryside
However , given the importance of the issue , I believe more information should be provided
Mr President , Mrs Izquierdo Rojo , I can tell you that what you said about par@@ o@@ dies certainly rings true with me
We have prepared a public relations strategy specifically so as to ensure that the proposals are discussed in the public domain
We do however expect - and quite rightly in my opinion - the national governments to at least provide correct information
Whether a government representative likes these proposals or not is of secondary importance
We have an entirely legitimate expectation , however , that no false information is put into circulation
Unfortunately , this requirement is not always respected
I would therefore say that this is a task for all of us
In any case I will continue to do everything in my power to send this information out directly from Brussels , particularly through the media
Question No 60 by Mrs María Es@@ ther Her@@ ran@@ z García , which has been taken over by Mrs
The new rural development aid being proposed by the Commission is a partial and temporary solution because it will decrease over time
What steps is it proposing to take to alleviate the situation ?
The EU standards included in these basic requirements have all been legally binding for a long time@@ ; they are nothing new
This Commission proposal cannot therefore directly create any additional costs
Furthermore , the measures that are available to Member States under rural development have been extended to include instruments to improve quality and also achieve better animal protection
The aid that is granted for applying a particular standard is limited in time , but the measure itself is not
As far as funding the measures on rural development is concerned , by introducing modulation the Commission is also laying the foundations for increasing the relevant budgetary funds
The Commissioner has just told us only what he was able to tell us
Other things have been left out , however , which have already been debated in the special committees on agriculture
We could also consider gar@@ lic , mush@@ rooms , honey , tom@@ ato , rice , wine , concentrated juices , etc
I would therefore ask you what supplementary measures are subject to the supervision of the Commission , but do not tell me that control falls to the Member States
What is more , this is not even a subject for which I am responsible
I would however like to comment briefly on what you said
Firstly then , why do we need a rice reform ?
Of course the world 's poorest countries include a whole series of rice producers
That is why our current rice regime will no longer work in the future and why we need to change it
I turn now to the question of import controls
This is , however , as I said , the responsibility of my fellow-@@ Commissioner Mr Byrne
Let us continue with rice
If the 40 poorest countries are so poor and are dying of hunger , why do they have to send us rice ?
Will we put a label on every grain of rice ?
And if they wish they can also import rice for their own use
That is part of the decision that was made in this House
Incidentally , I might add that I expressed my own misgivings about this from the outset
But the decision was made and I stand by it
How can we ensure that this is the case ?
We can do so by using those instruments that we also use in all other areas to check the origin of a product
This requires proof of origin , certificates and checks by the appropriate teams of inspectors , and in some cases on-the-spot checks or analyses are also necessary
As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed , Questions Nos 61 to 95 will be replied to in writing
The following questions are addressed to the Commission
( The sitting was suspended at 7
and resumed at 9 p
Mr President , I would like to welcome the Commissioner to this sitting
But it says something further
In the field of budgetary policy , the message seems to me to be equally clear
This Parliament is stressing its commitment , which it has always maintained , to the Stability and Growth Pact
On financial markets we are essentially in agreement
Thank you very much , Commissioner , I hope that the message is clear and that it is well received
My explicit question on this point , Commissioner , concerns the compatibility of the Lisbon objectives with the objectives of the Stability and Growth Pact
Clearly , this is not a question of procedure but a choice which must impact on the objectives of the Stability Pact and the way it is applied
Mr President , those politicians who launched EMU were bold and far-sighted
There were many who believed that the project would fail
Their fears have nonetheless proved groundless
EMU has been very successful
Now , further reforms are needed , however , as well as compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact by the Member States
Overall , the introduction of the euro has been a pain@@ less process , especially in terms of the huge logistical work involved
Certainly , there have been complaints about price rises , but the general price level has not increased
Further investigations may , however , be needed , something that we are now also requesting in this report
I believe that , as I hope you already know , Sweden ought already to have been a fully fledged member of EMU
Now , the situation is different , I am happy to say
In a referendum on 14 September 2003 , the Swedish people are to say yes or no to the euro
Fortunately enough , events have taken on their own momentum , independently of both the report and myself
In two areas , Sweden is considered , however , not yet to have fulfilled the criteria
The most controversial of the convergence criteria is that relating to the rate of exchange because , unlike the other criteria , it has been so un@@ clearly formulated
ERM membership must be viewed as a requirement , but the period of membership may be relatively short
The exchange rate criterion has , of course , also been applied flexibly to countries that have already introduced the euro
I am thinking in particular of Finland and Italy which were not , of course , a part of ER@@ M@@ 2 for two years
The issue of membership of ER@@ M@@ 2 is also significant and , of course , also very sensitive where the candidate countries are concerned
Because quite a few of them are well on the way towards adjusting to EMU , I would certainly advocate a degree of flexibility
I also noted that , in the course of a speech in Hungary the other week , the Commissioner was thinking along similar lines
Another area in which the Commission and the ECB consider that Sweden does not meet the requirements of the Treaty is legal convergence
This has to do with the independence of the Swedish Central Bank
The issue has also been taken up in an exchange of letters between the President of the ECB and the Swedish Finance Minister
The ECB expressed particular concern about the lack of clear rules concerning transfers of reserves from the Swedish Central Bank to the national trea@@ sury
In my opinion , this does not mean however that Sweden is dis@@ qualified from the third stage of EMU right through to 2006 or 2007
One of the most important principles of the Union 's legal system is , of course , that EU law takes precedence over national law
I would make bold enough to say that Sweden needs the euro
At the same time , I would also venture to say that the euro in fact needs Sweden
The Swedish economy is in good shape and can meet the necessary requirements
That is something I am able to say , even though I am a member of the opposition in my country
Now , it is the Swedish population that will decide this on 14 September
The ' wait and see ' approach championed by some of my fellow MEPs in Parliament rich@@ ly deserves to be criticised
Nothing at all would have become of it
The Swedish people want to be fully involved and to exert influence over both the new and the old Europe '
In conclusion , I want to say that there is a certain confusion where the amendments are concerned
I nonetheless want to say , however , that I hope to be able to achieve as large and as broad a majority as possible
I have listened to the criticism and am able to accept that Amendments Nos 12 and 14 should be removed because their subjects are covered elsewhere
Although this was not carried out , it ultimately anticipated the true situation seen at the end of the year in those countries
The tone of the speech President Romano Prodi gave this Parliament is therefore fully justified
Since then , many politicians , experts , research bodies , academics and leaders of public and published opinion have contributed their thoughts on the matter
All of this coincides with the increased difficulties that the European economy has been displaying
Following the enormous step that was the creation of the single currency , the Union appears today to be in a genuine state of paralysis
Many countries , incidentally , have enshrined principles and rules in their Constitu@@ tions establishing rules - some more rigid , some less so - for budgetary deficits
This , unfortunately , is the situation seen in many European economies at the end of 2002
Mr President , I will try within the time available to me to comment on the four reports presented to us
Mr García-Margallo has insisted on the need for a healthy macroeconomic policy and clearly supports the Stability and Growth Pact
I believe we take the same approach and we have no great difficulty in accepting his recommendations
He also refers to a point which we all believe to be fundamental and that is how we can increase the growth potential in Europe
But it is also essential - and this is the approach we adopted in Lisbon - to improve education and training
We believe it is also essential to implement more appropriate taxation in order to achieve these objectives and of course to carry out more public and private investment
I will discuss this in more detail when I come to the report by Mr Trentin
The broad guidelines for economic policy , however , should not be seen independently from the Stability and Growth Pact
Mr Trentin refers to this point when he points out the need to approach the Stability and Growth Pact jointly in Lisbon
what more can we do , in relation to the Stability and Growth Pact , in terms of growth ?
How can we ultimately improve the quality of public finances ?
In his report , Mr San@@ tos also stresses this point , which I would like to focus on further
I believe that the key lies in greater investment in research and development
It is true that the pact provides us with the initial means for achieving budgetary balance or a situation of surplus in the medium term
We believe that all actions which ultimately allow us to increase our growth potential must be treated in the same way
That report is a key to understanding what is done subsequently , in November , when we present our proposal for a communication to the Council
In our Commission Communication to the Council we do not intend to modify the pact or to make it more flexible
We also believe it essential in our Communication that the Member States confirm their commitment to the pact
That is why we requested a European Council resolution to allow this progress
Though I have said this several times , it is perhaps worth repeating that we insist in our communication on certain fundamental points
All of this has been approved by the Ecofin Council , with the corrections which I referred to in relation to the report by Mr Trentin
I come to my final comment on the report by Mr Schmidt
However we have yet to deal with those two elements which I hope can be resolved in the future
You know what our position is in relation to them
In the legal field , the Central Bank 's independence system must be adapted
I personally believe that the adoption of the euro would be beneficial to Sweden and I hope that that country will soon fulfil the necessary conditions
I also believe it would be beneficial for the European Union and for the eurozone in particular , since it would represent a significant advance in our process of integration
Mr President , I should first like to thank the Commissioner and applaud his clear statement in the debate on these four reports
In school I would say to Mr Trentin that he had stra@@ yed from the subject
Today you clean forgot about it once again
This cannot however absolve the Member States from applying strict standards in their budgetary policy , as prescribed by the Commission
We want to strengthen the Commission 's independence
The proposals that have been made in the reports are inconsistent in many respects
It is of course not the case that there is insufficient room for manoeuvre
Eight out of twelve Member States in the euro zone have already managed to balance their budgets
The offenders who are not sticking to the rules are the ones who are now calling for the Stability and Growth Pact to be changed
If Germany with its considerable economic power does not comply with the Stability Pact then it puts the stability of the euro at risk
We cannot def@@ lect attention away from the Member States ' responsibilities by correcting and re@@ touching the rules
The golden rule that appears in some of Mr dos San@@ tos ' amendments is of no use here either
There is no such thing as good or bad debt
The European model has brought lower inflation and stable monetary policy conditions
That is what we should keep as our basis , what we must be rigorous about keeping as our basis
Finally , I should like to say to our Swedish Members that we welcome the fact that Sweden wishes to join the Economic and Monetary Union
We will do all we can to help it to do so , but we ask that it be under the conditions laid down in the Maastricht Treaty
In this respect we have every reason to thank the Commission for the line that it is taking
Mr President , proactive and resolute leadership is needed on economic policy at the EU 's spring summit
We cannot go on tro@@ tting out the same old formulae
I should like to underline that it is out of the question to eliminate a Stability and Growth Pact that has been created to bring order to the economy
I think that we need to make every effort to halt the economic slide
We cannot deny either that even the European Central Bank is now talking about risks of a downward trend in the European Union
This means that we need to pursue a proactive policy and to that extent the repeated references to structural reforms do not serve any purpose either
Economic institutes , national ministries and also the Commission have not answered this question
But we need this answer to know which direction is the right one
employment creates growth , but growth also creates employment
We have to work on the basis of real growth and not only on the basis of potential for growth
We are not honouring the Lisbon agreement about 3 % growth
Neither are we respecting the agreement to invest more in research and development , and that too applies to both the private and public sectors
Japan and the USA are streets ahead of us in both respects
Firstly , we must improve the level not just of research and development but of its application within the productive system
Mr President , Mr García-Margallo y Marfil calls a spade a spade
He stated that the European Union does not have an economic policy
He has contributed to a good debate and I thank him for this
In considering causes and solutions , the notion of inflexibility and structural reform are often ban@@ died about
We are forever asking the Commission , the ECB and the experts what they mean
I have been struck by the imprecise and inconsistent nature of the responses
Clearly , the problem of pensions will not be resolved unless there is a large increase in employment rates in Europe
It is essential to mobilise all human potential
A great deal of work will have to go into reforming the labour markets , especially as regards training and qualifications
We must , however , remember that this involves reorganisation and there will be a price to pay
We must consider why there is a lack of productive public and private investment
One of the reasons relates to the flow of capital , much of which ends up in the United States
It does not provide for local development or for the development of SMEs and infrastructure
The European Union should be able to finance effective networks of services of general interest and develop policies on productive enterprises
We do not only have a supply problem; we also underestimate the problem of demand
Hundreds of billions in paying off goodwill are putting a serious strain on business and are hampering recovery
Far from fe@@ aring inflation , the European Central Bank should amend its target and reduce its real rates below zero
There are two more points I would like to make
I believe war against Iraq is not just madness , but economic folly too
It will increase public deficits point@@ lessly in both the United States and Europe , when we want to reduce them
As one of our experts said , the United States is sk@@ ating on very thin ice
The future growth of that country will require us to make even greater demands on our capital reserves
This is yet another contradiction
Europe cannot therefore just tag along with the United States
Europe must devise a policy of her own
We in Europe have our backs against the wall
The Convention , however , is silent
As for the calls for economic government , they bring to mind a scene from the film Sh@@ oul@@ der Arms
In it a military unit is eng@@ ul@@ fed in fog , everyone is stumbling around and a soldier is heard calling for his captain
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I have to recognise that there are a number of reports on broadly the same subject
This being the case , we will not support the report drafted by Mr Trentin , whom I greatly admire
We will consider instead Mr García-Margallo y Marfil 's report
The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is faced with a real operational problem
With a bit of luck , the report is approved when it is put forward by a rapporteur from the right
Be that as it may , I have long acknowledged that Mr García-Margallo y Marfil has demonstrated considerable qualities in his role as a rapporteur
As Mr Langen said , the Trentin report is clearly not actually a report drawn up by Mr Trentin
Mr Trentin 's speech almost entirely contradic@@ ted the contents of his report
It is my belief that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support all the objectives and comments on the subject as included in the García-Margallo y Marfil report
It has the virtue of bringing the objectives of economic policy back into line with the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives
We want to ensure that Europe is a model of economic growth
Growth should be based on high-quality investment in human resources , high-@@ calibre public investment and on the use of environmentally-@@ sustainable technologies
The García-Margallo y Marfil report does contain discrepancies
It is forced to ju@@ ggle the fact that the Stability and Growth Pact must be welcomed , while also acknowledging the need to finance investments
It mentions taxation , not interest rates
In short , the report tends to skir@@ t round the real problems of institutional impasse we are currently experiencing within the European Union
Next year these problems will cat@@ ap@@ ult us back into the situation of so-called euro@@ paralysis we experienced during the dark years of working towards the euro from 1990 to 1997
As we cannot control the interest rates fixed by the European Central Bank , interest rates will be too high
This will present problems for Member States wishing both to invest and pay off their debts
These excessive interest rates will also make the euro too strong
It will hamper exports at a time of global recession
Unless we resolve to tackle the Stability and Growth Pact as it currently stands , we will be unable to finance the investments Mr García-Margallo y Marfil calls for
The Stability and Growth Pact is an agreement , an agreement that we must hold one another to
The words that Mr Trentin writes about the Stability Pact in his report are worth reading
He says that even in periods of economic recession the pact must be adhered to closely and I am in complete agreement with this
Likewise Mr Gar@@ ci@@ a-@@ Margallo y Marfil rightly says that the European leaders at the forthcoming spring summit must dispense with vague and self-@@ satisfied declarations and must speak plainly
Clear agreements about the way in which we wish to achieve the economic objectives remain necessary to comply with the pact even in this period of recession
I am therefore greatly amazed when it appears once again that France is unwilling to comply with the agreements made
Last Thursday it again became clear that this Member State would make no attempt to put its 2003 budget straight
The radical Members will support them in their present form
I do not want to go into the details of the individual res@@ ports , but I would like to take this opportunity to make some more general comments
Firstly , I believe that we should be a little mis@@ trustful of high-@@ sounding slogans and goals such as the Lisbon objectives , to which we are constantly referring
I feel that the European economic structures need to be completely overhauled
The economic crisis in Germany is an indication of the crisis of an old economic model , the model of an old Europe which has nothing left to invest
We state repeatedly in the reports that we need more public investment - although we do not say where we are to find the money - and more private investment
it will increase if and when we have a more flexible economy , with flexibility introduced in large doses
We owe this to the future generations of European citizens
On 1 January 2002 , the euro was introduced as the currency , in notes and co@@ inage , of 12 European Union countries
The transition was very successful , and people accepted the new currency in a positive way
Wor@@ ries about price increases proved to be more or less unjustified
As everyone knows , Sweden is not among those countries that went over to using the euro as a currency
The reason for this was , of course , mainly political
If Sweden is to be able to introduce the euro as a currency , we must however formally meet five convergence criteria
The Commission and the ECB consider that Sweden fulfils the three criteria relating to price stability , public sector finances and long-term interest rates
With regard to the rate of exchange criterion , the Swedish k@@ ron@@ a has obviously fluctu@@ ated in value in recent years
With all due respect for the convergence criteria , the decision concerning Swedish participation in the third phase of EMU is political
It is a decision that will be made by the Swedish people
In the referendum of 14 September 2003 , the Swedish people will decide for a long time to come which currency is to be used in Sweden
On the other hand , Sweden is obliged , under the Treaty of Maastricht , to become fully involved in EMU cooperation once the convergence criteria have been fulfilled
Unlike Denmark and Great Britain , Sweden has no special exemption clause , but we shall hopefully obtain a ' yes ' vote from the Swedish people on 14 September
As a result , the Swedish Government need no longer , either intentionally or unintentionally , delay or avoid taking the measures whereby Sweden will fulfil the remaining convergence criteria
I noted with satisfaction that Mr Olle Schmidt accepted Amendments Nos 3 and 4 by the Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats
This will make it possible to obtain that broad support for the report desired by both the rapporteur and myself
Turning to the situation of public finances in France , one cannot help remar@@ king that economic policy is not considered as an issue of common interest
The Treaty is not being respected
One cannot help remar@@ king too that economic and monetary union does not actually exist , certainly as far as economic union is concerned
The Stability and Growth Pact is at the heart of these mechanisms
Nevertheless , it appears to be more of a safeguard rather than a tool of economic policy
The adoption of the Lisbon strategy could subsequently have been the catalyst that would have provided the economic and monetary union with an economic policy
In short , the Stability and Growth Pact has not proved to be a dynamic tool for implementing this strategy
In principle , the tools we have at our disposal are the famous broad economic policy guidelines we are discussing again this evening
These will galvanise approaches on European Union economic policy in the weeks and months to come
What could the outcome be , Commissioner ?
At present these broad economic policy guidelines are functioning as an academic exercise
Europe needs a strategy for growth
You said so yourself in your speech
This means we need more tools than we currently have available
Commissioner , the Council has just expressed its opinion on your statement
I think we need to go further and we must do so at the Convention
I think that we must work together to establish mutually acceptable proposals
Mr President , I do not have the time to del@@ ve into the possible differences between the text of the reports and the personal views of each of the rapporteurs
I will therefore focus my comments on the Commission 's statement and on the contribution of the Commissioner , and will offer both my strong support
In my view , the Commission is fulfilling its role as guardian of the treaties on this matter perfectly
I believe the Stability and Growth Pact is not dead
The Maastricht criteria mean we are committed to a monetary union that is also a political union based on a number of values
The stability on which the euro is based goes beyond the technical definition of the concept
It amounts to a mutual agreement on a form of social contract
As well as being a strong currency , the euro must above all be a stable currency
In proclaiming this principle , Europe is setting aside its bad habits of the twentieth century , characterised by inflation , which represented a tax for poor people
Europe has decided to commit itself to being a confident society with a stake in the future
These are the values we are presenting to the countries about to join the European Union
He@@ rein lies another reason not to alter these values by taking im@@ prudent action which would undermine them
When players are not doing well at a game , they do not ask for the rules to be changed , but learn them instead
Item 6 of this report states that the introduction of the euro is part of the Treaty obligations for all the Member States , including Sweden in other words
Mr Olle Schmidt hopes that the Swedish people will vote ' yes ' and so resolve this contradiction
On the contrary , the ' no ' camp is at present very clearly in the lead , by ten per cent according to the latest poll
The trend suggests that this lead will become ever greater
The situation does not therefore reflect the classic picture of an educated Europh@@ ile élite and an uninformed popul@@ ace
What we have instead is a political debate demanding objectivity and arguments on both sides
Sweden has a well-@@ run economy
Swedish industry traditionally asser@@ ts that the euro community is at all events good for trade
The business ' paper , A@@ ff@@ är@@ s@@ v@@ är@@ l@@ den has recently shown that this too is not the case
The economists sympathetic to EMU cannot deny this state of affairs
They therefore say , as Mrs Grö@@ n@@ fel@@ dt Ber@@ g@@ man just did , that the arguments in favour of EMU are not economic but political
It is not easy to sell this message to the Swedish people
The truth is that EMU has not been the success it was expected to be
The Stability and Growth Pact is coming up against ever@@ more criticism , and economic stagnation is increasingly widespread
This issue concerns not only Sweden , but also the UK and Denmark
We shall soon also have a range of new Member States that are also outside the framework of cooperation concerning the euro
In those countries , too , there may perhaps be referendums on the euro and , as a result , the euro may be rejected there
Is it possible to contemplate a euro community that is voluntary in character ?
What , in actual fact , do the Commission and the Council have to say about these matters ?
Mr President , our group voted against this report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs
In its current form , this report fails to challenge the principles of the neo-liberal credo , which unfortunately are at the heart of many Community policies
Yesterday , the dock workers brought this home to us forcefully in this very city and with every justification
The report does not query the validity of the stability and growth programmes to any significant extent
It is worth considering the meaning of the terms ' growth ' and ' stability '
By definition , things that are ' stable ' do not grow
Growth means mo@@ ve@@ ment; stability means the opposite
Certainly , the reality is dialec@@ tical in nature
On the other hand , this use of words could be construed as an attempt to resolve a contradiction
The report appears to reject any initiative to make the stability and growth criteria more flexible , and particularly the famous 3 % criterion
Given the present economic difficulties , some Member States , and not just the smallest among them , are finding it increasingly difficult to comply with the 3 % rule
Will this remedy kill the patient ?
We should note that experts from both the European Union and Member States gave overly optimistic predictions of growth
We hoped that the American economy would show signs of recovery , and that the European economy would follow suit
The policies pursued by Member States and the European Union were therefore based on inaccurate data
In this respect , the rigidity of the criteria of the Stability and Growth Pact seems to run counter to the fundamentals of good governance
People better qualified than I on this subject have spoken strongly on the matter
We should envisage policies of Key@@ nesian cyc@@ lic recovery
We should also consider policies aimed at achieving long-term improvement of the bases of the economy
These include , for example , energy efficiency and the provision of training
I would like to add that good governance implies reliable economic data , meaning the State must benefit from the Rule of Law
Mr President , we are currently engaged in a debate over the breaking of the Stability and Growth Pact
We should remember that , when considering the budget or any other subject , we must not fail to see the wood for the trees
The three countries with the highest deficits have one thing in common
They have all had socialist governments
I would add that Germany still has a socialist government
These governments have been lax on public spending and have failed to implement reforms which could have achieved savings
They have wasted the margins for manoeuvre achieved through the growth in the years 2000/@@ 2001
We are now dealing with the bitter consequences of this
This particular tree must not obscure our vision
The real problem is the general decline in public balances in the eurozone
The main cause of this is the slowdown in the growth rate , and the tide is not yet turning , even slowly
This goes against the somewhat unrealistic assertions of the reports we are considering this evening
One of the possible causes of this slowdown is the economic climate
The main cause , however , is to be found in the huge public payments and the lack of structural flexibility
No solutions have yet been found for the latter
In this respect , we must break the taboo and ask whether in fact the euro itself forms part of the rigid structures holding back growth
In view of the marked differences in performance between the eurozone and the countries outside the euro , the question certainly needs to be asked
Given that we are losing ground , should the Stability and Growth Pact be made more flexible ?
With respect to both the Stability and Growth Pact and foreign policy , the European Union , as usual , does not want to face reality
Instead it wants to paper over the ways in which we are slipping behind on meeting fundamental criteria
In our opinion , we should not lose sight of the objective of completely eliminating public deficits
This is certainly a laudable aim
We think , however , that the French Government is right to maintain their programme of reducing taxation in order to avoid aggravating the current crisis
We have to address a situation we have inherited and that is not of our making
We must at least try to do so in an intelligent way
I should like to start where Mr Gasòliba i Böhm left off
We are not setting new objectives
We are not making new promises or developing new hypotheses and analyses
If you do not take yourself seriously , then others will not take you seriously either
Some of us complain about the common principles of economic policy and at the same time criticise the fact that they are not respected
At the same time , we regret the crisis of confidence in Europe about many economic policy measures and the principles and objectives of the European Union
That is why I say very clearly on behalf of my group that we say ' yes ' to the internal market
We say ' yes ' to competition policy
But that also means that we must , at last , eliminate tax provisions that distort competition
For some types of tax , such as value-added tax , energy tax , corporation tax and the taxation of pension funds , a convergence programme is necessary
We say ' yes ' to a benchmark
Mr President , my home country , Sweden , will be holding a referendum on the euro this autumn
I believe that it will be possible quickly to fulfil the requirements regarding these issues if the outcome of the referendum is a ' yes ' vote
Our respect for these rules does not only have to do with the fact that they exist as external demands
Rather , it primarily has to do with the fact that we ourselves perceive that they are beneficial to the Swedish economy , which has also constantly been improving
At present , we have relatively low inflation and low unemployment , together with stable state finances
What is more , we have higher growth than many other countries
These are basically good rules
It would therefore be dangerous to begin to ignore these rules , together with budgetary discipline , as soon as some people have problems
That would undermine confidence in the euro and EMU
Allow me to mention a few examples , for instance concerning the matter of price stability
That is something that would favour growth and increase flexibility
The Commission has put forward an interesting proposal whereby countries with low national debts should be given increased opportunities to provide loans for long-term investments
That is something I believe would be constructive
Allow me finally to say that , for both political and economic reasons , I hope that Sweden will soon be involved in cooperation concerning the euro
I should like to express my thanks , especially to Mr Olle Schmidt who has produced a truly excellent report of which I shall vote in favour
Mr President , what has surprised me most in this debate is that nothing sha@@ kes the faith of some Members in the rigidity of the criteria for nominal convergence
Mr President , my contribution relates exclusively to Mr Olle Schmidt 's report
I would ask my fellow MEPs to be alert to what is stated in the report , for I find certain parts of it both erroneous and startling
Firstly , Mr Olle Schmidt writes that prices have not risen in those countries that have introduced the euro
Secondly , Mr Schmidt offers a false picture of the Swedish economy
He maintains that , in terms of trade , Sweden has been slipping behind because we have not introduced the euro
To that extent , the report is a biased contribution to the EMU debate in Sweden
Mr President , the downturn in the economy has proved to be deeper and longer-@@ lasting than was first thought
The present situation clearly highlights how important the Lisbon strategy for growth and competition is
Only three countries - Denmark , Sweden and Finland - have done what was agreed at Lisbon
Ireland , Great Britain and the Netherlands have also made considerable progress
The three biggest economies in the euro area , however , have not done enough up till now
If we were at school , ladies and gentlemen , Germany , Italy and France would be kept down a year
I would not use such harsh words normally , but this is a serious business
What in your opinion , after all , does a press report tell you which says that at present a hundred Germans lose their jobs every hour ?
International business cycles obviously play their part , but this does not alter the fact that our economic structures are so constrained that they are a huge barrier to growth
At the moment we do not need new targets or new complicated rules
Now is the time for action
This means genuine commitment to the Stability and Growth Pact and structural reforms
In practice this would lead to rules that are open to interpretation , and would weaken our credibility and our ultimate objectives in coordinating economic policy even further
Mr President , a fiscal responsibility for Member States is a must , inside or outside the eurozone
Having said that , I am and have always been in favour of an intelligent and flexible interpretation
Clearly there is room for improvement
I am sure the Commission recognises this
The economic cycle calls for more than an annual disapproval
Monitoring over such a short period of time is incompatible with real-@@ time analysis
I am sympathetic to Mr San@@ tos ' view that the cyc@@ lically adjusted deficit approved over the economic cycle is both sensible and prudent
Growth and stability are twin pillars
There are no high walls to keep the market out
The EU is increasingly in danger of being left out
The risk to the Community of not tackling substantial structural reforms is too great to be ignored
If we delay now , that will worsen , not ame@@ li@@ or@@ ate , economic down@@ turns
Today 's discussions have been enter@@ taining and hum@@ orous in many respects
Maastricht criteria or not , these two Member States have taken it on themselves to increase their deficits in order to support capitalist ventures in their countries
The attitude of the French Government demonstrates how France and Germany will respond to the in@@ junctions of the European institutions , if they do so at all
They may perhaps reduce their budgetary deficits , but they will not do so by reducing the considerable sums of money they give to employers
In France , this amounts to at least 10 % of the budget
There is certainly scope for making good a 3
In order to avoid reducing the money allocated to business , however , the French Government is cutting public spending
In truth , this means taking money away from public services
The requirement to balance the budget will mean less money for hospitals and schools
The population as a whole will suffer so that the wealthy can get away sco@@ t-@@ free
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the Lisbon strategy can only succeed if we promote competition between the European systems
In other words , we are concerned here with competition between economic solutions and , above all , with the best solutions to emerge from competition between the EU governments
That also ties in with the basic idea of subsidiarity in Europe
Moreover , we should - in my view , anyway - also take care that such objectives do not find their way into the EU constitution
What is more , we also need competition in the tax field , that is to say between European tax systems
Nor , above all , should we go on using the open coordination method in the form currently under discussion
In other words , we need , in the future too , an economic policy for which the Member States themselves continue to be responsible
Mr President , I would like to thank everybody who has taken part in this debate for the ideas and issues proposed and raised
It is also the case that we often tend to compare what happens in the European Union with what happens in the United States in a rather simplistic way
There are clearly other factors involved in terms of productivity and which affect the labour market
This apart , however , there are two elements which I do believe to be important
They are both in our synthesis report
What has happened between 1999 , when we launched the Lisbon process , and now ?
Nevertheless , our productivity has decreased in comparison with the United States
Within this context , is the Stability and Growth Pact an obstacle to recovery in Europe ?
The Stability and Growth Pact , by means of automatic stabilisers , has provided the Union with clear fiscal impetus
Does a further discre@@ tional fiscal policy in the Union make sense ?
We believe that an asymmetric shock clearly raises problems which are not going to be resolved through elements of general taxation policy
A@@ symme@@ tric shocks must be resolved through defining monetary policy and only in very exceptional circumstances does discre@@ tional fiscal policy make sense in the event of an asymmetric shock
However , we have introduced the room for manoeuvre into the pact which I referred to earlier , but we have introduced it in connection with that Lisbon growth potential
The Commission believes - and I am personally convinced - that the 3 % , in nominal terms , should be the fundamental anchor of our entire system
We must define a reference which is untouchable for everybody and I believe that that is the reference we have to work on
But it is not a reference which we have defined and to which we are too stubbornly attached and which cannot be changed
In summary , I believe the instruments we have will allow us to confront the current situation with a certain degree of coordination
If I am asked whether we should be satisfied , I must say that we have made progress , but not that we should be entirely satisfied
You have raised some of the elements of concern to us all
I completely agree with this principle and I believe it is one of the essential faults we currently have in our coordination system
Others have referred to the need to pay more attention to compliance with what is agreed and not to agree new things
Only if we are able to make progress on all these elements will we have a departure point which will allow us to grow rapidly when the economic context changes
I believe that our fundamental balances are in a relatively comfortable position at the moment
We are aware that our growth rates are relatively low
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken tomorrow at 12 noon
The Spanish Presidency made the common position possible , and the Danish Presidency worked hard at seeking dialogue with us
I am also glad and grateful that , in the last week , the Greek Presidency has set aside its self-imposed ban on engaging in talks
I should like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein 's political staff and secretariat for their constant readiness to engage in discussions with us and to work with us on reaching compromises
I should like to thank them most sincerely for their contribution
The second point I should like to make is that this directive has also clearly shown the problems we have where legislative procedure is concerned
Today we have the second reading debate , and tomorrow the vote
Parliament 's first reading produced 4@@ 58 votes in favour
If the Council had accepted this gesture of cooperation on our part , we should already have had this directive long ago
Nor does it just have to do with occupational retirement provision
As its name suggests , it is a directive on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision
That needs to be stated , because we are concerned here with a financial services directive
That being said , many wishes have of course been expressed to me in terms of defining the benefits , designing the products , and so on
We also had the task of structuring occupational pension schemes as the second pillar of retirement provision and of dealing with the social aspects of this
This directive is a success for the European Parliament
We amended the Commission proposal at first reading
At second reading , we shall amend the common position along lines that reflect our own thinking
This directive is not the end product
It is a first step
We have made amendments to six items as a matter of priority
The amount of information to be given to recipients of pensions has been increased
The biometric risks have been clearly formulated , and it has been made possible to cover these
It has been clearly specified that our objective is life-long pensions , which must be at the heart of our arrangements
The directive will lead to coordination of the work of the supervisory authorities , and it has laid the foundations for a level playing field
It has still not liberalised the assessment stipulations
Given the Council 's position , that was not possible
The directive is an important step in the right direction , however
I believe we have maintained the balance within the framework of our competences and the existing options
I should like most sincerely to thank all those who have contributed to the work
Mr President , the Commission would like to thank the European Parliament and especially the rapporteur
The rapporteur has been so kind as to thank my cabinet and my services
I am duly grateful for those compliments and shall certainly pass them on to my staff
This directive has clearly been identified as a priority by Heads of State and Government , notably at the Barcelona European Council
After all , the responsibility for designing and managing pension systems remains with the Member States and there is no intention of changing that
It is against that background that our efforts to create an internal market framework for the institutions offering occupational pensions must be considered
A directive aimed at creating a prudential framework for pension funds must fit in with this process of steady but gradual and coordinated reform of national pension systems
I am very pleased to note that the package of compromise amendments tabled by the PPE-DE , Socialist and Liberal groups fully complies with those two principles
Our group was very concerned at any possibility of the directive failing for lack of consensus in Parliament or between Parliament and the Council
But the rapporteur has very successfully squ@@ ared this very difficult circle
We in the PPE-DE Group are very pleased to support the compromise which the rapporteur and the Commissioner have engineered
I should , however , flag up some residual concerns which we still have
For example , compromise Amendments 4 and 12 give Member States the right to provide an option for coverage of biometric risks
I would appreciate the Commissioner 's reassurance as to his understanding of the impact - or hopefully non-@@ impact - of this option
The other concern regards the requirement for a register which also has to show in which Member States the institution concerned is operating
The rapporteur has assured me that , under the agreed amendment , no such register would be required if instead the institutions were ' authorised '
Again I would appreciate the Commissioner 's specific assurance that this is also his understanding
This would certainly be welcome to the financial services industry with a view to eliminating unnecessary red tape
Apart from these two matters , we are very pleased with the outcome which provides ample flexibility in , for example , how pension benefits are paid out
The lump sum payment will continue to be permitted
We are taking a major step forward in providing a Europe-wide single market in financial services
Mr Karas and Commissioner Bolkestein are to be congratulated for this achievement
Tomorrow we must ensure a resounding vote of support for this directive
In those circumstances , I would support it
From the time of the Green Paper up until now when the second reading is imminent , the directive has had several names
The name of the directive really does not matter now , however
What matters , rather , is the content
What this has to do with pension payments , you will first need to explain to me again
When it comes to the biometric risks , there is clearly no European solution , particularly not in terms of guaranteeing the amounts paid in
This is an essential plank of the Financial Services Action Plan
It will cut the administrative costs of many multinational companies ' pension funds , allowing people to have better pensions when they retire
It will help millions of European old people to retire in the sun
At present , European citizens are effectively being denied their right to free movement during their working lives and during retirement because of the patchwork of national pension systems
These impose unacceptable barriers when people seek to change jobs or residence
This is a big step forward in dealing with them
We look forward to more progress , particularly on some of the tax issues
Companies also suffer from a less mobile workforce and the additional bureaucracy , administration and costs involved in managing multiple pensions systems
This agreement also provides more choice of pension funds because it opens up the European market in investment management and pension administration
In future , we can have a genuine pension savings market of 3@@ 77 million people , expanding after enlargement to 450 million people
This is a vast potential market
Fund@@ ed occupational retirement schemes in the EU cover 25 % of the EU workforce and are currently valued at more than EUR 2 500 billion
They are expected to grow to more than EUR 7 000 billion by 2010
This is a key plank in the opening up of the financial services market
It is also a market-opening measure without using sledge@@ ham@@ mers to crack nuts
It gives a passport to pension funds to operate throughout the EU without trying to harmonise everything
For example , I am pleased that lump sums are specifically allowed
This insistence on the so-called ' prudent person rule ' - the rule that investments are decided prudently - will open up the fund management market
Overall this is an excellent measure
I commend it to the House
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I believe a directive on supplementary retirement provision businesses should have been established to provide a degree of social protection
The European Union does not have such a mandate however
Consequently , this report forms part of the work towards the objective of creating an internal market for financial services
Above all , this report will allow supplementary retirement provision institutions in Britain and elsewhere to benefit from their position and offer cross-border services
We voted against this report at the first reading at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs
The document certainly sought to correct the shortcomings concerning social obligations but it made investment risks worse
The common position of the Council better safeguards the prudential requirements for investment , but it does not meet Parliament 's demands on social issues
We have called for this common position to be rejected
We think that this report must be reconsidered in the context of the serious crisis affecting the stock markets at present
This is affecting pension funds
It poses a risk to the level of benefits and is causing contributions to be increased
Confidence in these pension fund systems will not be restored without strict management rules and mutual insurance structures for the guarantees
It is also necessary for these structures to be covered by European collective conventions between social partners
I would like to say that Mr Karas has worked very hard on this report and has ensured that the text is balanced
At the end of the day , however , we believe the amendments have a limited scope
This is down to the agreements between the different components of the political groups and what the Council deems to be acceptable to avoid conciliation
The report is an improvement on the common position , and the amendment proposed by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance strengthens the prudential requirements for investment
Nevertheless , the fundamental and essential sl@@ ant of the text remains
We are not supporting this proposal because we wish to oppose the financing of supplementary pensions through accumulation of capital on principle
As Mr Kuckelkorn said , a pension is a pension
It is not a form of saving
Pensions are for life
They provide for workers when they retire
They also offer certain guarantees in case of incapacity
R@@ ever@@ sion pensions provide for surviving spouses
Pensions are not financial products
It is quite possible that certain financial products and financial institutions may contribute to the management of certain pension schemes
Beyond this , however , we would be embarking on the search to establish European definitions of pension products and social mechanisms for the first time
We also need to consider in what circumstances financial institutions can make a contribution
At present , we are just dressing up savings products in a very ill-@@ defined way
I would like to thank Mr Karas for all the efforts he has made to make this d@@ res@@ sing@@ -up as convincing as possible
Sav@@ ings products have been dressed up to resemble pensions
With Mr Karas ' amendments , they were already far from being pensions
The compromise amendments , however , have made everything quite clear
They are purely and simply savings products and should be treated as such
It would amount to a violation of trading regulations to sell them as pensions
First of all I should like to thank Mr Karas for his report
It has been no easy task to reach a compromise on such a complex issue as the supervision of occupational retirement provision
I can support the compromise reached in principle , although it is a weaker proposal than I would like to have seen
I have submitted three amendments on behalf of the EDD Group , but also at the request of a number of fellow Members from other groups
I would like greater clarity from Commissioner Bolkestein on this
Is the European Commission prepared to promise that it will take account of the matters referred to in the amendments in the implementation phase of the directive ?
What promises can you make with regard to the subject of the annual reports and associated administrative burdens , as stated in the amendment to Articles 10 and 11 ?
A second question concerns the amendment to Article 18 , Paragraph 2
Are you prepared to review the absolute prohibition of loans and to give Member States the option of prohibiting them if so desired ?
In Recital 8 there is after all clear reference to the principle of subsidiarity
This recital is not in my view consistent with the prohibition provision in Article 18
If I receive a satisfactory answer to my questions , I will be prepared to reconsider my amendment
The English text contains the words ' or authorised ' and I think that this is what must appear in the Dutch text too
Mr President , I would like to join in thanking the rapporteur , Mr Karas , which I think is only fair
Secondly , I would like to stress the generosity of the European Parliament
We have sacrificed these positions , however , because we have always been aware that this directive was essential , at least for three reasons
Firstly , to make the freedoms enshrined in the Treaty more effective and more real , particularly the mobility of workers
These professional systems of a supplementary nature - I would insist on this aspect - will serve to maintain the future incomes of workers
This is a social approach which my group applauds
Mr Karas has highlighted many of the amendments which have enriched the original text of the Commission and the Council
And thirdly because it increases the coordination of the supervision authorities and promotes the possibility of cross-border activities
I would like to end , Commissioner , by stressing some of the deficiencies pointed out by the rapporteur
I would like to thank Mr Karas for all his work
The result of the second reading will probably be acceptable overall
We are going to create a European passport for pension funds
We are dealing with a financial instrument but one that has social objectives
Some improvements are therefore necessary in relation to the Council 's positions
We need to guarantee European citizens decent pensions
Pension funds will have a role to play in this respect , especially if there is also biometric coverage for contributions , or protection against the hazards of life
To present pension funds as a panacea however would be a deliberate lie
The press is today referring to a message from the European Financial Services Round Table to the Ecofin Council
It presents pension funds as a miracle solution to the problems of financing pensions in Europe in future
Pension funds that are based on the accumulation of capital , however , will experience exactly the same demographic problems once they reach maturity
In fact , pensions paid in any given year always involve transferring funds from working people to retired people , whether by redistribution or the accumulation of capital
Since the bur@@ sting of the speculative bubble , most pension funds have shown negative yields
In the United States , pension funds provided by large companies are having to face up to a deficit of more than USD 300 billion
In Great Britain , the company pension funds deficit was estimated at between GBP 65 and 130 billion at the end of 2002
There are also significant deficits in Sweden , the Netherlands , Belgium and elsewhere
Even the modest pension funds for Members of the European Parliament have just amended contributions by three points
This type of exercise would also save all redistribution funds
Due to negative financial yields , companies with pension funds no longer have a guaranteed benefit system but a guaranteed contribution system
In a guaranteed benefit system , contributors save money which they will receive in their retirement
In a guaranteed contribution system , people know how much they are contributing , but receive no guarantee of the result of fund managers ' investment policy
It also goes without saying that fund managers always take their cut of the funds , however the fund is doing
This explains why the financial sector welcomes the directive so warmly
Once again , the Group of the Party of European Socialists are not opposing the second and third pillar pension funds
We do , however , think that we need to act very prudently and that very strict prudential requirements are necessary
Mr President , pensions based on the accumulation of capital should not undermine national pension systems based on solidarity across the generations
That is of course clear , and so it is also right that we have two pension systems alongside one another , counter@@ balanced by the third-@@ pillar system
Meeting our requirements as it does , though , this directive is extremely important
I am also very pleased with this compromise
It is quite clear that not everything is regulated
In my country it has up to now been customary to insure biometric risks
It must be possible to prevent things of this kind and so that is why the compromise is exceptionally good
With regard to the provision of information , there has been criticism of the fact that we have gained less than we originally sought
This we have of course left aside , as is , I think , far and away the best thing to do in political terms
I believe that with its announcement the Commission has acted correctly , that is by examining the extent to which the present taxes are not discriminatory
We have recently had the D@@ ann@@ er ruling
While we still have a long way to go , I think that all in all we have certainly made a start
It shows that the Council and the Commission were in any event prepared to take Parliament seriously as a co-legislator
In a European context , however , a far more profound discussion is needed about the content and the quality of second-@@ pillar pension schemes
If you want to propagate the second-@@ pillar , fully-@@ funded pensions , you also have to lead the discussion about the structure and the quality of these schemes
In the Netherlands roughly half of the income of pensioners is provided by fully-@@ funded second-@@ pillar schemes agreed by social partners - in the future even more of it will be
That is a subject for social policy
That was also always on the agenda in the discussion and that should also therefore be developed further by way of the spring summit and those discussions about open coordination
On this point far more must happen , not only fis@@ cally , but also where the portability of pensions is concerned
Here too I would like to see a rather more ambitious approach from the Commission that finds its conclusion in legislation
Commissioner Bolkestein and those officials reporting to him , as well as the rapporteur , Mr O@@ th@@ mar Karas , have done a magnificent job in particular
I think with the work he has done with regard to this directive O@@ th@@ mar has shown he has the important qualities needed by someone who is influential in society
Ensuring the existence of retirement provision will be one of the main political challenges of the EU Member States in the years to come
To address this challenge , however , we have a difficult message for the people of Europe
We must work for a longer period of time but at the same time the pension we receive from statutory occupational retirement schemes will be smaller than before
It will certainly sound like a k@@ am@@ ik@@ a@@ ze mission to any politician but it is nonetheless inevitable
The status quo is not an option
This will be especially true on the day we make headway with decisions on taxation
It took 15 years to establish common EU laws
The EU citizen has long been able to benefit from local social and health services in another Member State
Furthermore , there has been common legislation in existence now for years applying to institutions providing personal pension insurance
The directive now leaves the social partners in the Member States with a free hand to choose how to organise comprehensive voluntary retirement provision
This is a reasonable European compromise considering the differences that exist among pension systems in the Member States
Our negotiations were at times both very intensive and intense , but I believe that we will be satisfied with the end result
The most important thing was that we avoided possibly having to resort to the conciliation procedure
Mr President , I congratulate the rapporteur , the Commission and the presidency on producing a package of compromises
It has been an issue of compromise all the way through
However , the people who have not been involved - as is so often the case - are the people most likely to benefit or suffer from our decisions
Compromise was very necessary
This is not a directive aimed at replacing the first pillar social sec@@ ur@@ ity-@@ type pension provision
In the UK , for example , people aged 16 have recently been out@@ numbered by people aged 60
The problem is that many people , even today , do not feel obliged or encouraged to save for their retirement
Many companies are ham@@ str@@ ung by administrative and legal costs prohibiting the promotion of such funds across the European Union
That is a statement of fact
I hope that we will come back to this discussion at a later date
L@@ ump sum payments have been dealt with in a way that pensioners in many countries will feel is a reflection of what already occurs
That is an important minimum
It is clear that the changes we have introduced on transparency and registration are improvements that everyone in this House can live with
Mr President , Mr Karas deserves our admiration
Moreover , he was the first and only MEP to talk about the gre@@ ying of the population
What I am not at all keen on is being called grey
What do old people want ?
It is just that all this is very difficult to achieve in the framework of occupational retirement provision that is only offered on a time-limited basis
Even a one-off payment - however generous it might be - does not provide security
Lifelong payments do most justice to the wishes and also to the needs of old people , corresponding to what we understand to mean by social security
Throughout Europe , we are in the process of discussing and solving the problems of a society in which people at long last ought to be living longer
I say ' of being able to ' , please note
Mrs Lulling will certainly agree with me when I say that this society and this Parliament need us
Anyone who , like myself , has six grandchildren can no longer just relinquish this society of ours to other people
We ourselves have to take care of it
We ol@@ dies are not of course in the end fighting for ourselves , since we obviously already have an income
Rather , we are fighting for the young men and women whom we wish to see have much longer lives
In spite of his best efforts , the rapporteur has not succeeded in improving the common position , which really does not add anything in terms of quality
What is really needed here are regulations to reduce people 's uncertainties at precisely the present time
Nor have matters gone significantly better for the other Member States
At a period such as this , people ought not , where the issue of pensions is concerned , to be led to expect quality when it is not present
That alone would signify ' back to square one ' and , for us , new opportunities of obtaining an improved directive
The Council has given an assurance that it is able to agree to the package before us
I believe we have to some degree succeeded in doing this
It is not our task here to prescribe what kind of supplementary pensions are to be provided and for what sums
I must of course be certain that I do not then have to become a burden on the state
That would have led to a level playing field and so to greater competition
That being said , this directive has done nothing to bring about a common market in supplementary pensions
Mr President , I hope it is not a disappointment to Mrs Lulling that the Commission has the last word
I welcome the fact that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Parliament agree on the compromise text , which may not satisfy everyone
At least it is an agreed text
That is what we need on this most important subject
Parliament is entitled to hear what the Commission thinks about the various amendments , but before doing that I should like to say something to three Members who have spoken
First , the issue of taxation referred to by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil , Mr Pronk and Mrs Lulling
The follow-up to the pension taxation communication of April 2001 has developed along two tracks
The process did not , I am sorry to say , lead to tangible results
A number of Member States could only accept any sort of agreement if the issue of residence taxation of pension pay@@ outs versus source taxation was also tackled
On that issue Member States remained deeply split
Secondly , the Commission has been examining whether or not the national taxation rules on the deduc@@ ti@@ bility of pension contributions are compatible with EU law
Here the Commission kept its promises to take action
Last month the Commission sent a reasoned opinion to Denmark and five letters of formal notice to Belgium , Spain , France , Italy and Portugal
In all those Member States pension contributions paid to foreign funds are not tax-@@ deduc@@ tible , while contributions paid to domestic funds are
That is a clear case of discrimination
The Commission is convinced that Community law prohibits such a difference in treatment
Therefore the Commission has no opinion on them
where the company is established
That includes provisions on biometric risks , but that should not be an obstacle to cross-border activity
Once again , the compromise arrived at means that there will be no conciliation
That is a good thing
One never knows where conciliation might lead
Personally , I have very vivid memories of conciliation from the takeover directive and am very anxious not to repeat that experience
Let me turn to the amendments submitted to the vote
I am please to say that the Commission can accept Amendments 1 , 5 , 13 , 15 , 22 and the package of amendments 25 to 37
The commission cannot accept the other amendments , which for the most part aim at widening the scope of the directive
The directive does not intend to interfere in the way Member States organise their pension systems
It considers that the directive should not regulate in a restrictive way the products offered by pension funds
Nor should it define the precise arrangements for the payment of benefits
The directive must also respect the diversity of occupational pension systems while setting some strict standards to ensure their mutual recognition , but without imposing unnecessary costs for pension funds
That is why the Commission rejects Amendments 3 , 4 , 9 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18
The directive should not experiment by allowing for the possibility of extending the scope of this directive to institutions that today do not offer occupational pension products
That is why the Commission cannot accept , regrettably , Amendments 2 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 17
That is why the Commission cannot accept Amendments 7 , 19 , 20 , 21 and 23
I should like to thank all colleagues for their attendance tonight
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken tomorrow at noon
( The sitting was closed at 11
This is the raison d' être of my political group 's proposal , which I supported , for an amendment seeking the rejection of the Council 's common position
The court 's 18 judges will be sworn in and the court will be inaugurated today
It is expected that prime ministers , presidents , and foreign affairs and justice ministers of the member states will attend
On behalf of the European Parliament , I should like to say in the clearest way that we , in this Parliament , have promoted and defended human rights
In so doing we have strongly supported the establishment of the International Criminal Court as a vital step forward at global level
We can be proud , as Members of the European Parliament , that the court will take shape today
In my opinion , for those who have offended the international human rights order , a body such as the International Criminal Court is better than a Guantanamo Bay
The House will recall that we have already adopted resolutions in this regard on a number of occasions , including as recently as last October
That is because we are fundamentally opposed to the financing of European parties by the EU
We do not therefore wish to get involved in the technical elaboration of such a system
The next item is the Council and the Commission statement on Iraq
Would the Members be so kind as to remove the bann@@ ers and sit down so that we can listen to the Council 's statement
The honourable Members are well aware of the Rules of Procedure
Please sit down and remove the bann@@ ers
The President-in-Office of the Council , the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs Mr Pap@@ an@@ dre@@ ou , has the floor
Iraq is a matter of concern to us on a number of counts
Iraq is testing relations and institutions and setting all of us a tough challenge
Relations between the United States and the European Union , trans-Atlantic relations are being tested
Relations between the European Union and the Arab and Muslim world are being tested
The countries in the Gulf , which surely have their own specific concerns about how things are developing , are also being tested
The concept of multilateral diplomacy and , more importantly , the relevance , future and modus operandi of the UN are being tested
At the same time , new challenges are testing us , such as weapons of mass destruction and international terrorism
Our approach , how we plan to step up our fight against these new threats , is also being tested
This is where Europe has a voice
This is a Union that believes in common values and our approach to current problems is based on these common values
We considered that war was not inevitable and I should like to stress that we still feel the same
It is for Baghdad to end this crisis by complying with the demands of the Security Council
The Fifteen fully support the ongoing work of the inspectors and wish to give them the time and resources that the Security Council believes they need
However , inspections cannot continue indefinitely
Pri@@ m@@ ary responsibility for dealing with Iraqi disarmament lies with the Security Council
Naturally , we - the Union - have our views , but it is at the UN that the decisions are taken
I should like to point out here that recent developments in Iraq are giving us grave cause for concern
We recently had the opportunity to listen to Hans B@@ li@@ x@@ ; according to the detailed Un@@ mo@@ vic report , Iraq has now started to cooperate
I refer to the start made on destroying the Al-@@ Sam@@ oud missiles and private , un@@ ta@@ ped inter@@ views with Iraqi scientists
We therefore call again on the Iraqi regime to comply immediately with these resolutions
We have taken important initiatives here
We have visited the Arab world repeatedly over recent weeks
Mr Patten has been to various countries in the region - Iran , Jordan , Turkey
The presidency has done likewise
I personally have recently visited the region four times
On the contrary , it is a crisis in which we are working with the Arab and Muslim world and this is well appreciated by the Arab world
Our third objective was to galvanise the Arab world into action , which I think we have succeeded in doing
An Arab League delegation is due to visit the region with a clear message for Saddam Hussein within the next few days
I think it would be a mistake not to recognise that relations have been particularly strained recently , especially over the question of Iraq
Naturally we are in constant contact with the United States as regards our position on the Iraqi question
This close collaboration is ongoing
As far as multilateral diplomacy is concerned , I think , as I have said , that we have fully supported UN efforts
As the presidency , we too have therefore tried to support every initiative which has originated in the Security Council
Numerous proposals have been tabled , by Canada , by Mexico , by Spain , Britain and America and by France and Germany
Europe is a community of values
This invaluable experience can guide us and give us an important base from which to deal with new problems in other regions of the world
With these few words I should like to thank you for lis@@ ten@@ ing; I am , of course , here to answer any questions you may have
I should just like to say that I wish I had more time for debate and could spend more time here in the House
Mr President , I wish to express my gratitude for the professionalism and courtesy of the Foreign Minister of Greece , with whom it is a real pleasure to work
I say that , having worked now with eight presidencies
The Minister said that he had spent a good deal of time in the last few weeks at about 30 000 feet
I can honestly say that I have spent a lot of my time in the last three and a half years at that al@@ titude
On the whole , when I have not been at that al@@ titude , I have been in this Chamber
Because of the range of my responsibilities I have probably spent - and enjoyed spending - more time in this Chamber than any other Commissioner
I think the House will know that I have tried to be pretty brief in my remarks so as not to take up too much debating time
I hope that I have never knowingly over@@ sold to this House the achievements of the common foreign and security policy - or even its potential under the existing Treaty
I have always been acutely conscious of its limitations
Foreign policy remains primarily a matter for democratically elected Member State governments
That will become more obvious as the Union takes in new members
But without better machinery to harness common political will , they are just as likely to drive an incoherent high-profile policy
This has not been a good time for those who believe that the way forward for European foreign policy is to leave things to the big Member States
It is in the interests of the whole world that power should be constrained by global rules , and used only with international agreement
What other source of international legitimacy except the UN exists for military intervention ?
On what other basis is it possible , indeed , to address the problem of weapons of mass destruction ?
I am here thinking not just of the particular case of Iraq , but of the wider issue
I regretted , too , America 's decision to re@@ sile so lightly from the Anti-@@ B@@ all@@ istic Mis@@ sile Treaty
For such decisions - and there have been many - send a dangerous signal about the value that the United States places on international commitments
That , surely , is a critical battle lost in what some call the ' war against terrorism '
For I find it hard to conceive how the terrorist threat can be confronted effectively except through international cooperation and disciplines
Im@@ pressive work has already been done within the European Union and through the UN Coun@@ ter-@@ Terrorism Committee
We should continue to help countries which find it hard to meet their counter-terrorism obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 1373
As a general rule , are wars not more likely to recruit terrorists than to deter them ?
It is hard to build democracy at the barrel of a gun , when history suggests that it is more usually the product of long internal development within a society
No-one can seriously dispute , however , that it would be preferable if - a huge ' if ' - we were able to disarm Saddam Hussein by inspections
The European Union is a massive donor in the Balkans and in Afghanistan , and we are already the largest humanitarian donor in Iraq
The Commission has been engaged in intensive contacts with UN organisations and with the countries around Iraq about how we might best contribute on the humanitarian front
EUR 15 million has already been set aside , but we may well need to go much further - drawing , if necessary , on the budget 's emergency reserve
It will be essential that , with other international assistance agencies , the European Union should be free to give independent and impartial help
A strict separation will need to be maintained between military action and assistance in order to preserve the so-called ' humanitarian space '
That objective will be much easier to achieve if the UN is recognised , at an early stage , as the lead assistance coordinator
Im@@ mediate humanitarian help is one thing , but the demands upon us will certainly extend much beyond that
As the House is all too well aware , Europe 's external relations budget is already heavily committed
It will be very difficult in any circumstances to launch massive new programmes in Iraq and in the neighbourhood of Iraq
But that is not my point
I am not making a quasi-@@ legal point
I am simply offering a political judgement of no great no@@ vel@@ ty or s@@ ag@@ acity
Our joint efforts should be directed to trying to minimise those potential effects
But there are three other areas , finally , where we should also work to reduce collateral damage from recent events
We must not be dis@@ heartened by this setback
As a Union of independent nations we do not enjoy that luxury
But that is a reason to redouble our efforts to build an effective CFSP , not to abandon them
A second European project that risks being hurt by recent events if we do not work actively to sustain it is the cause of enlargement
It is particularly damaging that disagreements over Iraq have been allowed to overshadow the debate about enlargement
We should not call into question the European vocation of countries simply because of their views on the Iraq crisis
Let us assure the acceding countries that we continue to look forward eagerly to their imminent membership
But , on the other side of the argument , let us also acknowledge that those who join our Union are making an exis@@ tential choice
They are not declaring themselves for Europe and against the United States - emphatically not
The present members may have set a very bad example ,
but that does not reduce the responsibility on all members , including the acceding states , to meet that Treaty obligation
Finally , I want to say a word about Israel and Palestine
What happens if there is a war in Iraq ?
Let us further suppose that all the worries expressed about the consequences in terms of the stability of the country prove unfounded
Let us , in short , put all or most anxieties to one side
I want to ask two questions
First , will the peace that breaks out drive Palestinians and Israelis into an historic reconciliation ?
'@@ The stark fact is ' , he wrote , ' that almost a quarter of Palestinian children are suffering from acute or chronic malnutrition for purely man-made reasons
No drought has hit Gaza and the West Bank , no crops have failed and the shops are often full of food
But the failure of the peace process and the destruction of the economy by Israel 's closure policy have had the effect of a terrible natural disaster '
European leaders have been told that will happen
We have been told that the road map will see the light of day before we all run out of road
I genuinely fear the outcome if war in Iraq is followed by another year or more of violence in Palestine and Israel
That would further inf@@ lame opinion in the Islamic world
Some say that to defeat terrorism it is necessary to defeat Saddam Hussein
That may or may not be true - some of us are at the very least agno@@ stic on that point
And the truth is - and we should face this fact - that none of us would be immune from the consequences of that
We must introduce our analysis of the situation by describing the actual facts in clear terms
We have to declare in explicit language that Saddam Hussein 's regime depends for its existence upon a secret service , upon violence , murder and terror
I am very much in agreement with the President-in-Office of the Council when he says that our goal must be Iraq 's complete disarmament
That is at the heart of the problem
Ladies and gentlemen , let us now take a look at America
I remember very well our debate in Brussels on the day after the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September 2001
It is because such a thing would have been a vision of horror that we say that it is a good thing that the United States of America exists
We are America 's friends and partners
That is true of our group
It would be a great achievement for President George W
Bush if the presence of these troops were to succeed - by peaceful means - in bringing about Iraq 's total disarmament
This is something we have to make utterly clear
It is for that reason that we hope that the United Nations will succeed in using peaceful means to steer Iraq towards disarmament
Now it is time for us Europeans to look at ourselves
We always make a big thing of criticising America , but it is not that there is too much of America - there is not enough of Europe
Where Iraq is the issue , it is not a good sign when one government after the other goes its own way without consulting with the others beforehand
Let me just make two additional observations
We must endeavour by all peaceful means to prevent this confrontation with Iraq 's criminal regime from becoming a confrontation with the Arab world
We welcome the visit to Algeria by the French President , which has met with great success
Let me conclude by saying that Israel has a new government
' yes ' to the UN and multilateralism , ' yes ' to disarmament and ' yes ' to democracy
Last Friday , in the Security Council , Mr B@@ li@@ x and Mr El@@ Bar@@ ade@@ i presented an account of the progress made on the inspections and on the efforts to disarm Iraq
Their report confirmed that progress has been made , including , where ball@@ istic weapons are concerned , the gradual destruction of Al-@@ Sam@@ oud missiles and others
Although he has done so reluctantly - ' à cont@@ re-@@ co@@ e@@ ur ' , as the French say - Saddam Hussein must allow the inspection work to go ahead
We also say that we must pursue a clear policy of inspection backed up by pressure , as stated in Security Council Resolution 14@@ 41
We must continue working on this basis , because war can be avoided and a peaceful solution is still possible
At the outset of a potential invasion , however precise the operation is , massive collateral damage will ensue
Our group feels that the approach we should adopt is to continue applying Resolution 14@@ 41 , within the framework of the law and of international law
Like Kofi Annan , we reiterate that any unilateral action would breach the United Nations Charter
The international community 's ambition to ensure world security must be based on preventive policies , not on preventive attacks
We must be more ambitious and more decisive if we are to resolve the causes of inequality , violence and poverty
I wonder , as we all do , what the consequences of a rapid military victory would be
What plan is proposed for addressing the extremely complex problems faced by the region ?
This letter promised peace , happiness and democracy in six months
Six months later , there was war in Baghdad
We must bear this in mind and learn the lessons of history
Ladies and gentlemen , the time has come , especially for Europe , to transcend our divisions
This is our message , which I repeat on behalf of my group
We must be guided by solidarity and by our commitments to one another , as laid down in the Treaties
These are obligations that are binding on all our States and on all our citizens
We therefore require the Spring Summit , to be held next week , to make all necessary efforts to create a united European voice , as the Treaties stipulate
Once they have signed a joint communiqué , each country cannot then pursue its own approach and there can be no repetition of the farce witnessed in the Security Council
We therefore need , and this is a very basic equation that all Heads of Government could understand ?
? we need our votes , plus that of Bulgaria
What makes the UN irrelevant is saying that we will be going to war whatever happens
Iraq has been under notice from the international community for over a decade and our patience on the issue of disarmament is running very thin
For Liberals in this House good relations between Europe and the United States of America are of huge importance
Our commitment to shared values , our commitment to economic and cultural ties reflected in our military alliance are things that we hold dear
We share America 's pain about the attacks of 11 September , and not just because European citizens were among those so brutally murdered
But we do not share the US President 's view that war against Iraq is justified at this stage
The report presented by Hans B@@ li@@ x to the UN Security Council last Friday does not make a case for immediate military action
On the contrary , he reported substantial disarmament and , while he recognised that cooperation was by no means immediate , he welcomed it as active , even proactive
His report showed that inspections are delivering tangible results for the weapons inspectors , sufficient to be given the additional months needed to complete Iraqi disarmament
To pull the ru@@ g from under Hans B@@ li@@ x 's feet and resort to war now , would be incomprehensible to moderate opinion around the world
I would ask our American friends to pause and reflect , if only for a few minutes , on some fundamental questions
Will a regime change in Iraq help bring to justice Al-@@ Qaeda terrorists ?
Will upheaval in a secular Arab state advance the cause of peace between Israel and Palestine ?
And would not the cost of continued vigilance , resilience and patience be lower than the cost of war and reconstruction ?
As the crisis unfol@@ ds we are also approaching a critical moment for the future credibility of the United Nations and a world order based on the rule of law
The remarkable unity displayed by the international community last November in agreeing unanimously to Resolution 14@@ 41 is in danger of falling apart
The dignity and integrity of the United Nations is at stake
For the US to disregard a UN decision against early military action would deal a potentially fatal blow to the United Nations
It does not matter whether this decision is reached because of the failure to muster the required nine votes or because of a French or Russian veto
A veto one opposes will always be less reasonable than a veto one imposes
Yet rules are rules , and UN backing for military action must not be circum@@ vented on the grounds that a veto is ' unreasonable '
It would be far better for any vote on a new resolution to be postponed until a consensual outcome can be achieved
The elements of a consensus can be readily identified , if only the artificial demands of a pre-@@ determined military timetable could be set aside
Mr President-in-Office , you have told us that war can still be avoided
The gates of the Temp@@ le of Jan@@ us have been un@@ locked , if not yet opened
In conclusion , it is claimed in London , Washington and Madrid that war could be short , swift and successful
Anyone who took it upon themselves to go beyond that mandate and to start a war unilaterally would be def@@ ying the whole of the international community
I hope that they would be calling upon themselves exemplary political penalties exac@@ ted by their own peoples
As for their credibility in the eyes of the world , it would no doubt be adversely affected for a long time
To show too much of one 's ' hard power ' is to run the risk of ruining one 's ' soft power '
Yet this is precisely what the President of the United States is envisaging quite sha@@ mel@@ essly
When it comes to taking action , we are short of neither tr@@ ump cards nor allies
It is within that camp that the voice of Europe promoting world solidarity must and will have to make itself heard
That is our second tr@@ ump card
Thanks are also due to Mr Patten for some of the strong and just words that he spoke on the subject this morning
As for other allies , it was on the other side of the Atlantic that we found them
There , you have a United States which does not desp@@ ise Europe , but which places its hopes in Europe and welcomes its representatives with open arms
What , then , did our US friends tell us ?
) is receiving unprecedented support prior to the start of the conflict
The New York Times , too , has chosen to say no to war
This is a far cry from the sacred union that some people have been telling us about
Con@@ gres@@ sman Den@@ n@@ is K@@ uc@@ in@@ ich , the spokesman for the coalition for peace , echoed these sentiments when he told us , ' George W
Bush has threatened to isolate those Europeans who are resisting his claim to su@@ pre@@ mac@@ y; this is a perfect moment to take one another by the hand '
Finally , Mr President , may we each have the US friends that we deserve
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , there are some things that I just cannot understand
For example , we always defend the Treaties
Spain , the UK , France and Germany must therefore uphold a common position
The common position defined by the leaders of the European Union , whether we like it or not , does not talk about ultimat@@ ums or about the consequences of war
It says that the work of the inspectors should be continued
This is precisely the memorandum proposed by France and Germany
I do not , therefore , see how , in the name of the Treaty , Spain and the UK can fail to uphold that position
In the final analysis , we must have a decision , within Europe , on the real nature of our Treaties
Frankly , I do not understand why it is necessary to make war when we have won the war already
Why take military action when we have won without it ?
We have to admit that , without the US , there would not be any inspectors now
There would be no inspection and no disarmament
However , since there is disarmament and since there are inspections , it is not necessary to go to war
Why , therefore , should we shoot and kill , when we can have everything without shooting and killing ?
We are criticising ourselves by saying that the situation is as it is thanks to a certain amount of determination , whether we like that determination or not
We are now being told , and I still do not understand it , that we shall be bringing democracy to Iraq
What , then , are we doing with Turkey ?
The Turkish parliament is elected
It is a democracy
Whether or not we like the people who are elected , that is not our problem
For example , we continue to explain that we are going to liberate the people of Iraq
We tell the Iraqi Kurds that this will be fantastic , that we are going to liberate them using the Turkish army
finally they will be under the domination of the Turkish army
Yet there is one key to democracy in the region , and that key lies in Teheran
There is no question of making war on Iran , and yet the people in Iran are fighting for democracy
The Iranians are the only people who , at the present time , are rising up against their totalitarian regime
They are the only people who are staging massive demonstrations , who are voting in favour of democracy
We are not helping them , but we then go on to claim that we have brought democracy to other regions
I believe that we should be doing exactly the opposite
By helping the Iranian people to liberate themselves , we would be providing the region with two lessons
That would be an extraordinary lesson for the region , and far more meaningful than the occupation of Iraq by some US general
Finally , therefore , let us all stop being blind
It is not peace , but then war is not the best way of ensuring that the Iraqi people are finally allowed to live in peace
They have the right to live in peace , without any US general , but also without Saddam Hussein
Mr President , President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the United States of America is a great democracy
It has contributed much , and if we look at the last 50 years , no one can forget the crucial role that it has played in defending freedom
This is why I and my group refuse to place ourselves in the awkward position of saying that we are for the US or against the US
That would be a stupid position
We cannot have it both ways
The United States has been the victim of a terrible attack
Thousands of its people have been killed
No one can forget that
It therefore has the right to defend itself; it has the right to respond
Who , though , was responsible for those attacks ?
It was the Al Qaeda organisation
Is there any proof of links between Al Qaeda and Iraq ?
The answer is no , there is no proof
Consequently , the United States , before engaging in this military operation , should tell us what its real reasons are , the deep-seated reasons why it wants to intervene
That is why we in our group are agreed that every effort must be made to achieve a solution to this problem by means of disarmament
From then on , once this principle has been established , the decisions will not be taken in this House
There is something nice and surreal about our debates
Mr President , there is a bizarre contradiction in this Iraq debate
Reports are reaching me from Iraq about contacts between leading representatives of the Ba@@ ' ath regime and the Iraqi opposition
Saddam 's immediate en@@ tourage is evidently preparing itself for the fall of the ' Republic of Fear '
As a last resort it is trying to save its own skin by announcing an uprising now in the event of an American military intervention
What , though , do I perceive within the European Union ?
A number of large Member States are working hard for the political status quo in Iraq
UN weapons inspections with no clear time limit are supposed to be sufficient to rein in the regime in Baghdad
On what is this great political credit that they are granting the merciless ty@@ rant Saddam Hussein based ?
This irresponsible attitude taken by a number of European countries is met with manifest and widespread in@@ comprehension on the part of the suffering Iraqi population
All because of a murderous megalom@@ an@@ i@@ a@@ c who for years has simply been refusing to comply fully with UN resolutions
Such a scenario must encourage similar dictatorships to go their own way where weapons are concerned
Is there anything that the Member States of the European Union can still salv@@ age from this divisive conflict over Iraq ?
I am looking forward to initiatives from the Greek Presidency on both these issues
The diplomatic resolve of France , Germany and Russia may give the politicians of the United Kingdom , and even those of the United States , pause for thought
War is war , but the prelude to war is not war
The resulting shake-up of the world would release the forces of evil everywhere
Then again , what would be the next stage in the promised res@@ haping of the Middle East ?
Mr President , this is a very special day for me in the European Parliament
I have heard speeches from Mr Cohn-Bendit and Mr Le Pen which I consider to be in@@ distingu@@ ishable
Since we last debated the Iraq crisis the stakes have increased
The clear issue remains that Saddam is still playing for time
The United Nations call for disarmament , as set out very clearly and unanimously by Resolution 14@@ 41 , today continues to be unfulfilled
That is the truth of the situation we face
I must say that the events of recent months have also demonstrated two important truths for us here in the European Parliament and for Europe more generally
Firstly , we undermine the unity of NATO at our peril
Some anti-@@ American voices in Europe have been playing out their contempt for all things American , and we may hear more of that in this debate
Let me make it clear beyond any doubt , on behalf of the British Conservatives , that we stand resolutely behind NATO as the bedrock of our security and defence
I make no apology for repeating our belief in NATO and the value that we attach to our partnership with the United States
I believe that the actions of France , Germany and Belgium in f@@ omen@@ ting division within the Alliance over the crucial issue of Turkey 's security are nothing short of deplorable
The coming days will be a test of the will of the international community and of the credibility of the United Nations
the responsibility for avoiding war remains squarely with Saddam Hussein and it is up to him to choose peace
On 11 September 2001 , every nation and government in Europe without exception rallied round the United States of America when it came under terrorist attack
Today every nation in Europe , although not every government , is against this fruitless , futile war
The lack of unity between the Fifteen is having a knock-on effect when it comes to dealing with the crisis
We have to realise that international conventions need to reflect the new state of play in a considered manner , using procedures which do not cause rifts
It is also worth reiterating a few matters of concern to us , the European Union
We spoke with one voice on the Palestinian problem
And yet , our united voice went unheeded
We spoke with one voice on Iraq , on the embargo against the Iraqi people
And again , our united voice went unheeded
We therefore have to realise that persistence is needed at times when our policies may be able to bring about practical results which do not in turn foster new crises
Ladies and gentlemen , we really are at a crucial stage , but I think that every crisis contains in it the germ of a new standard
We need to tell our American friends that their perception leads to trouble , trouble which is not even in America 's interest
Mr President , in my own country , Sweden , a priest proposed yesterday that , in order to avoid war , someone should be paid to kill Saddam Hussein
Certainly , some of us have had these thoughts in secret , but this type of murder cannot of course be committed
It would be contrary to international law
The war could nonetheless perhaps be stopped if Saddam Hussein were to resign or go into exile
The discussions now being conducted within the Arab world to induce Saddam Hussein to resign are extremely interesting
We hope , of course , that an international court will be able to hold Saddam accountable for his crimes
If the clock could be turned back , there is a lot in the Iraqi conflict that could have been done differently
The Arab world should have been involved much earlier in the discussion of the future of the whole of the Middle East
The United States , the EU and the UN Security Council ought to have shown greater commitment to solving the conflict between Israel and Palestine
The peace talks must begin again
Otherwise , we shall never win the fight against terrorism
Now , the dr@@ um@@ be@@ ats of war can be heard
The progress that has been made has been due not to Saddam Hussein 's having become willing to cooperate but to the resolutions and the threat of military force
We must never forget that it is Saddam Hussein who must prove that he does not have weapons , not the UN which must find them
Hopefully , war can still be averted
It is our view that if , in fact , any military decisions are to be taken , they must be taken by the UN Security Council
The UN is , however , seriously wounded at present
The horse trading that is going on in order to convince countries to vote yes or no in the Security Council is pathetic and damages the entire international community
When the permanent members quarrel , these difficult decisions are left to countries such as Ghana , Cameroon and Angola
This is unreasonable and frightening , and it undermines the UN 's credibility
Substantial reform is becoming a matter of ever greater urgency
The UN is divided , as are NATO and the EU , and transatlantic relations are damaged
The only person to delight in the fact is the dictator in Baghdad
Mr President , what is this war about ?
Knowing the answer to that question is of course the prior condition of being able to prevent it
As the weapons inspectors become more successful in their work , the purpose of the war is , however , changing
I now also hear from my esteemed fellow MEP , Mrs Malmström , that what is at issue is removing the dictator in Baghdad
Excuse me , but I thought the idea was to disarm Iraq and destroy its weapons of mass destruction
The picture I now have is of the UN 's far exceeding the limits of its powers and replacing regimes we do not like
We do not like Saddam Hussein
Where is the EU when people take flight from the abominable dictator described by my fellow MEP , Mr Evans ?
Why do we throw those refugees back into the hands of the regime we want to change ?
Why , just as my fellow MEP Mr Cohn-Bendit said , do we not support democratic movements in Iran ?
I shall stop there , for I have no more speaking time left
Europe in that time has been putting patience and diplomacy to use in an attempt to enlarge the Union
That is a symbolic and clear difference
If Parliament and the Commission were to accept ultimate responsibility , the EU could act with authority for the benefit of world peace and an international legal order
That is unfortunately not the case
Has the war against Iraq already started , or not ?
Or has the war against Iraq never really stopped since the first Gulf War and the struggle for hegemony in the Middle East simply entered a new phase ?
History will be the judge
The United States and Great Britain were subsequently able to bomb in Iraq with greater success
The new weapons inspections under the direction of Hans B@@ li@@ x and the United Nations , and accompanied by military threats , have however been successful
We must therefore pursue this path and we must unite the European countries around this position
The fact is that after more than ten years and 17 UN resolutions , the Iraqi regime is still delaying destroying its illegal weapons
This time , however , Saddam Hussein will not be able to continue to de@@ fy international law
I also wish to make it clear , however , that we will not remain neutral in the event of a conflict
We will always be on the side of democracy and not of tyranny
We are also on the side of international law , because we want to see immediate and unconditional compliance with the 17 UN resolutions on Iraq 's disarmament
It is simple , Mr President
To ensure that , if we face a direct threat in future , we can count on their solidarity too
The real actors are still the nation states
There is no longer any united international community , there is no united West , any more than there is a united Europe
The West , the so-called international community , and Europe , have been completely shattered
No , the nation states are the only ones left , and we are happy that proof of this has been provided in such a glaringly obvious way
That is also something that we have always claimed , namely that empire equals war
The nation state , on the other hand , is the only possible way to bring about the non-@@ totalitarian unification of the world
All the same , this very morning , many Members have exec@@ rated Saddam 's regime and called for democracy and freedom for the Iraqi people
I hope , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that Europe may once again speak with one and the same voice on this basis
We must remember that the inspectors are not private investigators - they are not bud@@ ding S@@ her@@ lock Holmes - they are simply information ga@@ there@@ rs
We accept , however , that they have made progress
They have been able to do so simply because of international pressure , the last resort of which is the use of force
I assume we all agree that we must do whatever we can to ensure that international terrorist organisations do not gain access to these weapons of mass destruction
I assume , Commissioner , that there are no doubts about this
I also wish to point out that , for the moment , everyone , except for Saddam Hussein , has acted with the utmost respect for international law
Simply saying ' never again ' will not get us anywhere
You will forgive me , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , if I continue in German
Mr President , the threat of a punishment must always be so credible that the punishment does not need to be carried out
The massive military presence around Iraq , and Bush 's rhetoric , have finally had their effect on Saddam
Sud@@ denly he is cooperating with the inspections and destroying weapons he said he did not have
It is therefore naive to think that Saddam could have been called to order with diplomatic pleas alone
To this end he is even trying to bribe members of the Security Council , in particular to make possible an attack in the near future
Bush and Blair have now become the prisoners of their own rhetoric and their diplomatic inability to mobilise sufficient support
A unilateral military intervention will lead to unprecedented instability and seriously impede the reconstruction of Iraq
European policy must consist of maintaining the pressure on Saddam and certainly there must be no headlong rush to war
We must be specific about what compliance we are expecting of the ty@@ rant within a timeframe that the inspectors consider reasonable
Only the UN can ensure that Saddam obe@@ ys , and that the punishment does not need to be carried out
The UN and public opinion worldwide want nothing to do with this war
Reas@@ on and justice refuse to submit to the fanatical fundamentalism which has been holding sway for some time now in Washington
The Iraqi people are innocent
Why , when they have been suffering for so long under such a cruel embargo , is it necessary to bomb them as well ?
This war will precipit@@ ate a conflict between civilisations
This time , it is not the Islamic fundamentalists who are pushing for war , but the US administration
The reactions will be terrible
Yesterday the Al-@@ H@@ as@@ ar mosque , the Mo@@ sle@@ m Vatican , called for a holy war against the United States
In the Security Council , France will use its veto to oppose the war , and so will Russia
We must preserve peace
Bar@@ b@@ arity cannot be combated with barbarity , and war , whether we like it or not , is a form of barbarity
It is also an old-fashioned way of settling conflicts
This is a complete contradiction and , in terms of international law , it is a further black mark against the US Government
If I wanted to sustain Mr Bush 's metaphor , I would say that the US State is a super-@@ rogue
However , I shall not do so , because that would be to insult the American people , and I do not want us to end up insulting one another
Last week , in fact , we had an opportunity to meet US elected representatives who are openly opposed to the use of force
They are demonstrating against the war alongside their fellow citizens and they constitute , in my opinion , the great majority of public opinion
European history from 19@@ 30 to 19@@ 39 is the history of a Europe that , step by step , gave in to Hitler 's expansion and aggression
'@@ There will be peace in our time ' , said Cham@@ ber@@ la@@ in when he returned from his meeting with Hitler in Munich in 19@@ 38
Today , the Cham@@ ber@@ la@@ ins of our own time say that Saddam Hussein can be dis@@ armed by the weapons inspectors
If that is the case , why was this not done long ago ?
That is something that is easily achieved using conventional small arms
The war against Saddam Hussein must be a war of liberation
It is a question of democra@@ tising the Arab countries
The EU must think again and be much more active in promoting the freedoms and social development of the Arab peoples
As long as we only have words to offer , we are powerless
If the United States is allowed a unilateral war , we may soon see China invade Taiwan or Russia trying to create another Soviet Union
Therefore , I ask the Greek Presidency to con@@ vo@@ ke a General Assembly meeting
Mr President , the worldwide confrontation on the subject of Iraq between two concepts of international relations is splitting Europe in two
The crisis is dispe@@ lling our illusions and bringing us face to face with reality again
The most determined supporters of the US vision are European , as are its most articulate opponents
The Convention will therefore have to learn certain lessons from this return to reality
No-one should continue to imagine that an all-@@ purpose common foreign policy can be imposed by means of majority constraints
That would be to opt for the alignment of Europe rather than for its independence
The CFSP must adjust its ambitions to fit the reality
If the United States of America declares war unilaterally , we will have great problems persuading our people of that war 's legitimacy
It will be extremely difficult to restart the transatlantic dialogue , and , above all , to gain our citizens ' support for it
We are told that a b@@ lit@@ z@@ k@@ ri@@ e@@ g would make it possible first of all to establish democracy in Iraq and then to dry up the springs of terrorism
What are we being told about the mobilisation of public opinion , the new super-@@ power ?
Our hope is that there will be a majority against an ultimat@@ um within the Security Council
We believe that war is avoidable
That will depend to a large extent on Europe
However , first of all , let us hope that there will be a majority in the Security Council
We wanted to have inspections and international legality , and all Europeans agree on that
The inspectors have carried out their work , and we acknowledge that they have made progress
The inspectors are asking us for more time , and we must give it to them
What can Europe do when it is time to make decisions on the Iraqi crisis ?
Parliament adopted a resolution calling on the Security Council to act against Saddam Hussein because of the terrible crimes he has committed against humanity
We strongly reaffirm this , because that dictatorship has left an appalling trail of blood in its wake
That is why Iraq must be dis@@ armed , but only through the UN@@ ; the democratisation of Iraq must be supported , but only through the UN
Unilateral war will split the UN@@ ; it will split the Atlantic Al@@ li@@ an@@ ce; and it will throw Europe into crisis
What happened in the case of the former Yugoslavia ?
The Security Council could not decide on intervention in Kosovo , but NATO carried it out with the agreement of the European Council
If there is war , it will be a disaster
Let us unite , therefore , against the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and for the freedom of the Iraqi peop@@ le; let us keep war away from the young ?
Mr President , we are on the verge of a disaster announced and desired by the US Government
What an admission that is
Afghanistan , Colombia , the Philippines , Venezuela , Palestine - no one is to be spared
Yet , on 15 February , another upheaval occurred
Thousands of people invaded the streets of our capital cities to say no to war , and they will do so again on 15 March
Democracy means taking up this challenge , and not a single elected representative or government can escape that fact
The veto is now on the streets
Here and in the USA , we all have to decide which side we are on
We are obliged to watch as un@@ disguised attempts are made in the Security Council to use economic aid as a bribe to induce African states to consent to war
Since this House 's last debate on war in Iraq , though , encouraging things have happened
For the time being , at least , the Turkish parliament has refused to allow the deployment of troops on Turkish territory
In Great Britain , over two hundred Labour Members of Parliament have expressed their opposition to a war
They deserve our respect
Those who oppose the war in Iraq that is being planned are no fo@@ es of the United States , but rather defenders of civilisation
Ladies and gentlemen , we initiated the reflection on this subject in our previous debates
Obviously , we have not found a final answer to this question
Weapons of mass destruction constitute a real threat to the survival and health of populations
Mr President , the role of the inspectors appears to be crucial to this debate so perhaps I should spend some time looking at their activities
Many people have claimed that they have been successful so far@@ ; I have to say that is not my view
Yes , there has been some success but it really is the tip of the iceberg
Iraq 's pros@@ cri@@ bed weapons programme '
That document is 17@@ 3 pages long and it lists 29 separate sets of unresolved issues; these include the strong presumption that 10 000 litres of anthrax still exist
We also know that a dr@@ one has been discovered which is capable of spreading biological and chemical weapons , and we know the cluster bombs have also been discovered
That is not a success
The report is a clear indication that Iraq is in breach of Resolution 14@@ 41 , it is not fully cooperating with the inspectors , nor is it coming clean
Indeed on 7 March the Iraqi permanent representative to the UN yet again , despite this evidence , claimed Iraq does not have weapons of mass destruction
Yet despite this evidence , many people here have said the inspections should continue
At what point do we say enough is enough ?
Let us remember that 12 years ago Iraq was given 15 days to disarm
Indeed , only yesterday the U@@ 2 sp@@ y planes that he gave concessions for were grounded
Is that not a sign of what is to come ?
Yet we still ask for indefinite inspections , surely that is simply because we do not want to have to make a decision
Commissioner Patten made a very cogent case setting out the dangers of unilateral ac@@ tion; there is very little I can disagree with
What he did not talk about is the future of the UN if we do not take effective action to enforce 12 years of resolutions that have not been followed
The future of the world is at stake
We have heard much about ex-@@ presidents , the Pope , academ@@ ic@@ s; they all have one thing in common , they are totally powerless
At this time when the future of the world is at stake , we need honesty , courage , determination and nerve to enable the international community to act together
We must have a second UN resolution , we must have a clear timetable in order to say inspectors can go on for so long but no further
When that happens , then we must prepare to go to war
Mr President , we all know that disarmament , which is making progress , and the removal of Saddam Hussein are merely a pretext
The real motive , of this there can be no doubt , is the quest of the USA and its allies to control Iraq 's oil fields and geo-strategic position
Will they use their 4 votes in the Security Council to do this ?
Will the Greek and other governments stop helping to prepare for war by giving the aggres@@ sors every possible assistance ?
We must bar the road to ruin
At the same time , let us express our solidarity with the Iraqi people in their fight to overturn this tyrannical regime
On the contrary , it will only be an obstacle to it
It did that in Rwanda , and it lost us a million people
The willingness of the United States and the United Kingdom to extend the ultimat@@ um to Saddam Hussein opens up a new glimmer of hope for peace
a goal that it is not impossible to achieve
Europe must also make its loud voice heard , however , by avoiding divisions and conflict
We must learn from these difficulties so that Europe can , once again , play a leading role on the international stage
This is because every act of international diplomacy these days can only be aimed at building a solution to the Iraqi crisis
The European Union and the United States must find joint initiatives within the framework of the international order
Mr President , history has taught us that it is almost impossible to work together with dictators , because they do not care if their own people suffer
That is also the case with the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
The Iraqi people have had to pay dearly for their leader 's un@@ yielding attitude
Prior to that the Iraqi leadership had de@@ fied the decisions of the UN and not agreed to give up its weapons of mass destruction and weapons programmes
Although there has been progress with the weapons inspections there are still more than a hundred unanswered questions in the weapons inspectors ' reports
My country , Finland , strongly emphasises the importance of the UN 's role in finding a solution to the Iraq crisis
President Hal@@ on@@ en said yesterday that Finland will support the Security Council and its decisions and that force without its authorisation was unacceptable
Hal@@ on@@ en also said that Finland supports the continuation of the work of the weapons inspectors as long as it is meaningful and useful
The Security Council must consider how much time it has got left on the basis of the weapons inspectors ' report
It is extremely important that the Security Council members use all their skill to achieve unanimity
The aim should obviously be for Iraq to be dis@@ armed without the use of force
If this calls for military action it must have the approval of the Security Council
Pur@@ pos@@ eful diplomacy must come before public appearances by the Security Council members
The weapons inspectors must be given enough time to do their work , but that must not mean that Saddam Hussein can play endless games with the international community
Th@@ ron@@ gs of people throughout the world have gone onto the streets to demonstrate in favour of a peaceful solution to the Iraq dispute
The role of the UN and its Security Council must come first in resolving the Iraq crisis
If the UN cannot now act we are in danger of losing the most essential global instrument we have in safeguarding world peace
The European Union must now take a united stand and use all its powers to shore up the viability of the UN
Mr President , it has fallen to my country 's government to drink of this bitter cup
We can forge a massive alliance with the people of Europe
No presidency has been in the privileged position of having the people of Europe take to the streets and standing united
They need a common reference point , not just Mr Schroed@@ er or Mr Chi@@ rac@@ ; they also need Mr Sim@@ itis , the head of the Greek Presidency
These are hard times and , like Belgium , we are a small country
Your heart is in the right place , but we want results
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , nobody is left unaffected by the danger of war in Iraq
I know nobody who would not rather see a peaceful solution in Iraq
Among democrats , such a thing should be self-evident
Our own willingness to seek peace will not , though , on its own be suffici@@ ent; we also have to do something about it
This is where Europe has become less important
Over the past weeks and months , we have failed to maintain and build on the crucial role we once had as the USA 's partner
It is unfortunate that my government - the government of the Federal Republic of Germany - has played a substantial part in bringing this about
Europe still does not speak with one voice in matters of foreign policy - indeed , it does so less now than ever before
We are further away than ever from having a common foreign and security policy
That is why Europe needs the United States of America as a guarantor of peace and freedom in the world
It is not Europe that is in a position to contain the conflict between India and Pakistan
It is not Europe that is able to take up positions in North Korea in defence of our security
On its own , Europe does not have the capacity to combat international terrorism
What is a fact , though , is that Saddam Hussein is a threat to the peace of the world
On this continent of ours , we have often had to deal with despo@@ ts whose intentions were apparent from the outset , as are those of Saddam Hussein
It is a lamentable fact that , in Iraq , terror , torture and murder are arbitrary and a part of daily life
It is a fact that many questions have still not yet been answered
Does Iraq possess the small@@ pox virus ?
What was done with the mu@@ st@@ ard gas g@@ ren@@ ades ?
Where are the highly dangerous V@@ X nerve gas , the large quantities of anthrax , the 6 500 bombs carrying chemical weapons , and the mobile weapons laboratories ?
No less important than getting answers to these questions is the need to give some thought to the region 's future
Here lies Europe 's great mission
I call on the foreign ministers to join with the Commissioner in developing models for dealing with this region 's future and for relations with it
Is such disarmament best achieved through military intervention or through continued work on the part of the weapons inspectors ?
It may be appropriate once all the other options have been tried
What is more , I believe that the weapons inspections are working
One might perhaps wish that they were working still better , but progress is at present being made
We must bear in mind that the inspections are working because of the pressure on Saddam Hussein and the threat of armed intervention
It is therefore important for this pressure to be maintained
This situation cannot go on forever , but the time limits that have up until now been proposed by the United States and others have been quite unrealistic
That is why the weapons inspections must continue
To launch an attack without a decision by the UN Security Council would be utterly reprehensible and a violation of international law
It would have far-reaching consequences for the UN 's future legitimacy
The UN system has its faults , but we have no other such system on a global basis
We must therefore join together in helping to maintain this system
The EU 's role in this conflict is a sorry chapter
The proud declarations concerning the common foreign and security policy that are usually made on solemn occasions have of course proved br@@ ittle when they have been put to the test
If the EU is in future to play a role in the area of foreign policy , we must learn from what has happened
Otherwise , the EU will not be able to play an important role in the future
Mr President , Commissioner , perhaps we shall succeed in saving Europe , and that would , at least , be something
It is true that , after a year of uncertainty , of contradiction and of conflict , there are positive signs
The disarmament of Iraq is underway
We have seen , in effect , that even with massive propaganda , neither s@@ ar@@ cas@@ m , nor threats , nor portfolio policy have succeeded in stopping the protests
Moreover , remarkable and intense diplomatic efforts are being made within the UN , and there is also , thank goodness , the work of the Greek Presidency
If the objective is democracy in Iraq , there are ways , other than war , of creating it
T@@ z@@ ve@@ tan To@@ dor@@ ov , who studied the totalitarian systems of the twentieth century , had an excellent way of describing this
He said that democracy is not imm@@ un@@ ised against the temptation of the good , which may lead it to the worst , in other words the dropping of humanitarian bombs
Let us not , tomorrow , drop humanitarian bombs on Iraq , on an Iraq which we shall have succeeded in dis@@ arming , but not succeeded in protecting
Furthermore , trading insults across the Atlantic serves no purpose , and only makes matters worse
It is hur@@ tful to be accused of being anti-@@ American simply because one is opposed to the policy of the current US Administration
It adds further insult to injury when one is accused of forgetting the US contribution to two world wars
That does not mean that we should not be able to disagree on occasions , especially when we believe the strategy to be wrong
It was the US that provided resources and support to these unsavoury individuals when they were their allies
Now the whole world - not simply America - is paying the price of these errors of judgement
The UK and the US should pause and reflect before they embark on a course of action without UN authority
The UN is the accepted cust@@ o@@ dian of international law , with unique structures and processes to uphold it
This means that anyone supporting this principle must abide by its decisions , including the use of veto
One simply cannot adopt an à la carte approach
Mr President , many claim the split over Iraq is between Europe and the USA
However , in reality it is between France and Germany and 19 other pro-@@ US new European governments
France and Germany have alien@@ ated America , undermined the UN and NATO and exposed the difficulties of achieving the CFSP
France and Russia will be judged harshly for using their UN veto for cynical , commercial interests in a second resolution , sending all the wrong signals to Baghdad
The alternative is to contain Saddam for a while until the world 's attention is focused elsewhere and he can once again re@@ arm
In the meantime , let us not be deterred from confronting a dangerous menace when we can
Mr President , what has happened to the EU 's common foreign and security policy ?
A month ago , the French president wag@@ ged his finger at the candidate countries and demanded a declaration of solidarity with the EU
On the contrary , it is Saddam Hussein 's task to produce his weapons of mass destruction and destroy them under the weapons inspectors ' supervision
If Saddam Hussein has already destroyed the weapons of mass destruction he possessed , then he must supply the weapons inspectors with documents to that effect
UN Resolution 14@@ 41 leaves no room for a game of hide and seek
Personally , I have no confidence in Saddam Hussein 's goodwill
He has repeatedly de@@ fied the UN , and he has never in actual fact complied with UN demands
There is no difficulty in diagno@@ sing Saddam Hussein as having a severe personality disorder or being seriously disturbed psychologically
He boasts of having murdered someone for the first time when he was eleven years old
He went on to murder one of his ministers in the course of a government meeting
He has murdered those closest to him in his own family , and he has employed gas g@@ ren@@ ades to kill his own people
He suffers from megalom@@ ania comparable with that of Hitler and Stalin
The people of Iraq need alternative political leadership
Allow me to express the hope that this can be brought about without the need for recourse to war
Mr President , in recent weeks we have witnessed dangerous rifts in the United Nations and in the international institutions of the democracies
The future European Union is already split between 18 countries which have declared one view and three or four which have declared the opposite
NATO effectiveness may have been fat@@ ally undermined
What possible motive could there be for this ?
Much nonsense is talked about who armed Saddam
We should be clear that it is Russia and France that armed him
Much nonsense has also been talked about control of Iraqi oil
We should be aware that Iraq 's policy is to award gas and oil concessions to countries supporting the easing or lifting of UN sanctions
Twelve years ago we stopped at the gates of Baghdad
We did so on a commitment by Saddam Hussein that the weapons of mass destruction would be dismantled
Twelve years later , countless resolutions later , countless promises later , countless inspections later , that commitment has still not been fulfilled
We are where we are today because of that
' We are either with the American people , we are part of them , or we are not '
That remains as true today as when it was first said
Let us look at the politics
The failure of the CFSP is our fault
The Bush administration has never hidden its determination to remove Saddam Hussein by force if necessary
Congress approved this and Europe largely ignored it
I have an interest here , as my kin@@ sman T
Law@@ rence sought and expected Arab autonomy
Indeed , the road map for peace between Israel and Palestine is published - it is on the Palestinian Authority 's website
We all know that in the democracies public opinion is opposed to conflict
Who knows , however , what real public opinion is in the Arab countries ?
At the same time , people 's aspirations for more freedom and greater participation in decision-making , have grown , fuelled by rising incomes , education and information flows
So speaks the United Nations
Our efforts to promote democracy and human rights in the world are founded in the framework of the Democracy and Human Rights Programme
The core principles of the CFSP - promotion of democracy , human rights , the rule of law and fundamental freedoms - are absolutely crucial here
Mr President , Saddam Hussein is the root cause of the Iraqi crisis
We must not forget that Saddam Hussein threw out the previous weapons inspectors in 1998
That gave him four years in which to develop biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction and long-distance missiles of the Al-@@ Sam@@ oud 2 type
The existence of these self-@@ pro@@ pe@@ lled missiles was long denied by the Iraqi regime
Now , they are being destroyed under the supervision of the weapons inspectors
Saddam Hussein is a dictator and ty@@ rant , prepared to embrace any methods whatsoever to fight his enemies , including that of murdering his s@@ on@@ s-@@ in-law
It is just such weapons of mass destruction that the UN inspectors have not been allowed to search for
For twelve years , Saddam Hussein has attempted to mock the surrounding world by playing a cat and mouse game with the UN weapons inspectors
The EU 's common foreign and security policy has foundered when it has been most needed
Difficul@@ t situations put our trust in each other to the test
Obviously , there is now a lack of such trust in each other within the EU
A European Union in which we do not have confidence in each other is an unstable structure
First of all , is there any possibility of resolving the crisis diplomatically in the short time left
The final objective is quite specific and we are all agreed on it
The second point is that the summit Council basically instructed the Greek Presidency to take initiatives
First of all we have to exhaust and make every effort to exhaust diplomatic channels to resolve the Iraqi crisis
We have , of course , emphasised that Saddam Hussein himself is responsible for any consequences
That is what will make us more efficient , especially when it comes to resolving the problem peacefully
We know what the consequences of war are@@ ; they are mani@@ fold and unpleasant and the Council has naturally insisted that every initiative should be exhausted
However , the question posed by Mr Watson and , even more insis@@ tently by Mr Cohn-Bendit is , I think , a reasonable question
Mr Cohn-Bendit asked why the United States or the international community could not say that we have succeeded
And this is one of the problems we face
Whether the glass is half full or half empty
And when the Arabs ask for clarification as to what message they should send Baghdad , the current discussion in the Security Council about so-called benchmarks is extremely important
Are there specific targets which would allow us to assess whether Saddam Hussein has taken the strategic decision to disarm at the insistence of the Americans and the British ?
And if there are , how long should this assessment take ?
As Mr Titley pointed out , there comes a point at which enough is enough
The summit Council has already agreed that there has to be a cut-off point
So I believe that we should not see war as a foregone conclusion
We need to continue in our diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis peacefully
That brings me to the second point I wished to make about a European voice , about a European presence , to quote Mr Poettering , about European unity
Of course , as Mr Alavanos quite rightly pointed out , the presidency can only act within the framework of the decisions , the unanimous decisions taken by the Council
However , we do have a common position
We have common conclusions although we differ in our practical approach
Of course , the final decision as to what we are going to do about Iraq does not rest with the European Union
It rests with the Security Council
I should also like to comment on something Chris Patten quite rightly said about the unity of the European Union
We can play a part on the political stage if we work hard - large , small and medium-sized countries together , with a strong , united , European voice
That brings me to the question of Europe 's presence
I think that the crisis in Iraq has highlighted important questions about what happens the day after the crisis , whenever that may be
We have demonstrated our skills over recent years in foreign policy , witness the Balkans
We have a unified , cohesive , substantive policy which has an influence in the area
I think that we should take this as an example when deciding what to do next
Finally , as far as a European voice is concerned , I have a couple of comments to make about enlargement
It is vital for enlargement to proceed and not to be affected by the present climate and for us to learn from the lessons this experience has taught us
That is , if you like , the meaning of enlargement
My third point , and this was a question raised by a number of members , concerns the crisis in the United States
I agree with the numerous speakers who say that ' anti-Americanism ' versus ' pro-@@ American policy ' is a false dilemma
This would only obscure the real dialogue and the real debate needed
What are the threats today ?
How are we going to deal with these issues ?
How are we going to deal with terrorism ?
We understand the sc@@ ar left by September 11
But at the same time , as Mr Patten said , what is the reason for terrorism in Palestine ?
Is a strategic , policing approach the only way to wipe out terrorism ?
Or do we in fact need to win the hearts and minds of the people in the regions in which violence and conflict often foster terrorism ?
This is where Europe has an important part to play
As Mr Patten said , we invest in humanitarian aid and development aid and we open our markets to regions throughout the world in order to boost their economies
We deal with problems such as poverty , the environment , equality , ethnic crises and fundamentalism
And this is not a weak Europe talking
It is a Europe of values and experience
I should like to say here that you , the European Parliament , have a very important part to play
I have spoken with the President of Parliament about his initiatives and I think he is in full agreement with this prospect
Fourthly , I should like to say something about the Arab world
Many of you emphasised that this crisis must not be a clash of cultures or religions and highlighted a real fear that such might be the outcome of this crisis
Our partnership with them is very important
So I think our position is very important and the Arabs certainly approve of it
However , as Mr Brok said , cultural dialogue is the top priority
Mr Cohn-Bendit spoke about democracy in the Arab world
We do not dis@@ agre@@ e; I agree entirely and have emphasised the fact that democracy , the notion of democracy cannot be imposed
The word itself tells us that it originates in the public , the people , the citizen@@ ry , that it comes from the bottom up
We therefore have to cultivate democratic institutions
Before I finish , I should like to comment briefly on a matter which was raised
Both Mr Watson and Mr Cohn-Bendit asked whether Cyprus and democratic developments in Turkey will be the first victims
There may indeed be a great deal of fallout from the crisis and we shall have to deal with it , regardless of whether or not there is a war
And it would , of course , be a double w@@ ham@@ my if this very progress towards change and reform in Turkey were to fall foul of the crisis
I think that the Turkish parliament really is acquiring democratic momentum which we must respect and build on
Here again the European Parliament has an important role to play
I think we all need to keep up our efforts to bring about democratic change in Turkey
We also need to understand why Turkey has a number of serious fears about Iraq , especially the integrity of Iraq
If Iraq 's integrity cannot be safeguarded , the Kurdish question will blow up in our faces
The European Union is committed to protecting the democratic and minority rights of the Kurds
Iraq may perhaps become a federation at a later date
However , the European Union is against any thought of changing the borders and threatening the territorial integrity of Iraq
I think this is an important message that needs to be underlined
This crisis is also causing Turkey serious economic problems , which will be even worse if there is a war and we in the European Union must understand that
At the same time , Turkey 's progress towards the European Union calls for a solution to the Cyprus question
On behalf of the presidency , I should like to express our appreciation of all Kofi Annan 's efforts to resolve this problem
However , these efforts are not finished
This chapter has not closed and , of course , the Cyprus question will not be sacrificed to Iraq
I think there is still a great deal of momentum and there will be increasing momentum as Cyprus integrates into the European Union
We want the Turkish Cypriots with us
We want them here in this Chamber
We want them in the Council , we want them in the European institutions
That means , however , the Cyprus question needs to be resolved
We want to see the Turkish Cypriot community with us
That means we also want Turkey 's help to ensure that the Turkish Cypriots do not remain excluded from this big family , this community of values
Ladies and gentlemen , I have spoken for longer than the Rules of Procedure allow
My thanks to you and the President for your for@@ be@@ arance but , as I am sure you understand , this is a very important debate
I just want to finish with a couple of comments
We are indeed in the middle of a crisis but , as the Chinese say , a crisis is both a threat and an opportunity
The main opportunity here is to reform our own institutions and operations so that we have a more important voice on the international stage , a united voice
Secondly , it is an opportunity to restate our relations with the Arab world , as I said , through cultural dialogue
It is an opportunity for new relations with the United States , articulated around the issues of security , democracy and multilateral diplomacy
Europe is a pro@@ to@@ type for multilateral cooperation , the like of which the world has never seen
This teaching power is a decisive factor
And what we teach is the strength of law , not the law of the strong
This moral authority must be safeguarded if we want to live in a world of security and freedom
Ladies and gentlemen , the presidency will make every effort to respond to the demands of the citizens of the European Union , the European Parliament and the Member States
You said very clearly that Parliament had an important role to play
At this crucial time I am sure that every colleague here would wish you and Commissioner Patten every success in looking after the interests of the peoples of Europe
The debate is closed
In today 's debate , however , we have clearly felt , among certain speakers , the beginnings of a slide towards a sort of anti-@@ American ex@@ al@@ tation
This argument reminded us of the old dialec@@ tic which we used to hear too much of precisely during the cold war
Thanks to that argument , the objective of dis@@ arming Saddam Hussein , and even sometimes of condemning him , has gradually disappeared behind anti-@@ American jubil@@ ation
The next item is the vote
There are , though , two aspects of it to which I would now like to draw attention
As rapporteur , I asked myself whether we should go along with this game , but we decided to leave well alone
We are not joining in this char@@ ade either
There is , though , another peculi@@ arity to which I would like to draw your attention
I was then curious enough to ask how the Member States measure such undeclared activities as prostitution , for example
It appears that there is a rule of thumb for this purpose
It is known that an ever-increasing share of the EU 's own resources is dependent on the gross domestic product
It therefore follows that some Member States do not give the full figures , as then they would have to pay more
On the other hand , they then also have to pay in dri@@ bs and dra@@ bs , that is to say , by underestimating their G@@ N@@ I
Then , of course , they would have problems complying with the Maastricht criteria
Mr President , the Karas report was discussed yesterday evening from 11 p
The group leaders will have noted your comments
Mr President , at the eleventh hour the rapporteur , Mr Thomas Mann , has made some further effort to move some way towards my group 's position
We very much appreciate this effort
Nevertheless , the result does not yet entirely meet our expectations
This is because there are a number of passages concerning SME policy and concerning tax reduction that we cannot wholeheartedly support
I would therefore like to call on my group to refrain from voting on this report
I broadly share the rapporteur 's concerns about the need to adapt companies ' obligations to file information to the digital age
In a border@@ less area , this will only be possible by using the most up-to-date techniques and information technologies and the voluntary publishing of information in other languages
The provision that companies ' websites should also contain the minimum particul@@ ars laid down in Article 4 of Directive 6@@ 8/@@ 15@@ 1/@@ EEC is also important
This directive would also need to be updated with regard to the types of company it covers and with regard to its references to accounting requirements
I therefore voted in favour of the report
I have voted in favour of this report because I attach enormous importance to adopting better and swifter measures for dispute resolution in civil and commercial matters
The main criticism made in relation to the use of PP@@ O relates to the need to adapt diesel engines
hydro@@ gen , li@@ que@@ fied natural gas , electricity , etc
I congratulate Mrs Ayuso González on the document on which we have voted today in plenary and which I fully support
Mr President , the Karas report regulates supplementary pension funds with a directive
I hope it will be successful in the next version of the directive
Mr President , I welcome the Karas report and the compromise amendments which we agreed
I was particularly pleased that the amendments seeking to abolish the lump sum payments that are very common in British pension funds were dropped
There are an awful lot of people in our countries today who are very concerned about their pensions
They feel that their pensions are under threat and insecure
European legislation should not be adding to the uncertainty that people feel about their retirement
Ex@@ tra products should enhance pension security , not undermine it
The compromises we reach today will go some way towards doing that and make sure that everyone in our countries reti@@ res on a decent pension
We believe that the funding of retirement pensions should be based on the principle of contributory schemes
Institutions for occupational retirement provision cannot be treated as mere financial instruments - they should be thought of as a form of social protection
Since the first reading , we have fought to have the basic principles of biometric risk , regular information for participants and control of these institutions integrated into the text
We reject this forced takeover
I mis@@ tak@@ en@@ ly voted against Amendment No 38 , tabled by the GUE/NGL Group
I am , however , in favour of rejecting the common position on the grounds that it is completely unsatisfactory
The markets being shared out within the WTO between the monopolies and the heav@@ y@@ weights are not restricted to industrial and agricultural produc@@ ts; they also encompass services
the privatisation and liberalisation of any remaining public sectors
The Communist Party of Greece is radically opposed to this process
We condemn the greed of the monopolies , the plundering of national wealth , the savage exploitation of the workers , with miserable working conditions and attacks on social benefits
Is the WTO an organisation for dismantling public services ?
That is the impression given by the General Agreement on Trade in Services
Postal services , energy , railways , this is happening to all of them
And when will culture , education and health services be subjected to competition ?
I would like the mandate given to Pascal Lamy , the Union 's negotiator , to be clear and extremely well-defined
Because we are talking here about the common principles and values to be defended - equality of opportunities and equality of access - and not a mere commercial negotiation
The mandate given to the Commission should be decided unanimously by the Member States , and not by a qualified majority
Nobody has been able to see its content , not even the national parliaments , who have not been able to debate it
And it is they who have voted for the creation of public services
Only a few MEPs have been allowed access to the mandate document , in a room especially prepared for that purpose , with no@@ te-@@ taking formally prohibited
This is a wonderful example of the democratic deficit
We have voted against Parliament 's resolution which gives the Commission a mandate to negotiate a liberalisation of the trade in services , within the so-called GATS round
We believe such a development would make GATS even more of a trap for us
It is also noted with some am@@ us@@ ement that the French Government has protested and has called for unanimity on these ' very sensitive ' issues to be maintained
However , should these areas be considered more sensitive than others , than the production of water or nuclear engineering , for example ?
If unanimity really ensures such good protection , why is it demonised in all European affairs ?
This is a disastrous development for the vast majority of society
It is a real attack on the working classes
The problem is not only the preservation of cultural diversity , even though it can legitimately be stated that culture should not be a commodity
How can we accept this for water , electricity , postal or rail services and other socially important sectors ?
We want to speak out against this entire development and we oppose any opening up of public services to competition and the quest for profit
We oppose any attack on employees in these sectors and any job losses
All the amendments of the GUE/NGL Group in this regard were rejected
This type of Europe is not the European Europe for which I have fought for 40 years
I am sorry that , on a subject which is so important for the future of European citizens , we have to be content with a resolution procedure
A Commissioner should only speak on behalf of the European Union after having negotiated their mandate with the elected representatives
The Constitution should take account of this democratic deficit if it is to succeed in bringing Europe closer to its citizens
As the amendments proposing a new political direction for the text have been rejected , I am voting against the resolution
Public services should not be part of negotiations
A moratorium suspending any new agreement would allow for a genuine impact assessment with regard to the other market services
Some claim that the developing countries have asked for these agreements
Trade at international level is essential , but it must be conditional on adoption of and compliance with environmental and social rules
to pursue the liberalisation of services and strengthen the role of the WTO within the framework of unequal globalisation
The authors of the joint resolution are aware of the general concern caused by GATS
However , nominal precautions cannot conceal the fact that the adoption of this resolution would represent one more step towards the commo@@ di@@ tisation of services
So should we privatise and commo@@ di@@ tise the world 's public goods such as health , literacy , knowledge and water ?
According to the WTO , the answer is yes
Everything is a commodity
People pretend that they want to preserve cultural diversity
It has also been said that no liberalisation offer has been made by Europe in the fields of health , education or audio-visual media
However , US intellectual ' fast food ' chains are already buying a university in Madrid
The audio-visual media of Berlusconi , Bou@@ y@@ gues and Mur@@ do@@ ch are a commodity
The explanation that Commissioner Lamy gave on Monday 10 March at the beginning of the debate on the commitment of the EU to the GATS negotiations sounded reassuring
In spite of this explanation the fear being articulated by the US and by the developing world is that the position of the EU is quite a different one
The availability of drinking water for the poor is said to be under threat
Can we now speak of the EU being much tougher on the outside world than on its own Member States and inhabitants ?
The concluding response from Mr Lamy sounded less reassuring than his beginning
For me this is a reason for putting supplementary questions to the European Commission shortly
If all the amendments from the Left are rejected , I will vote against
I recently visited Ey@@ em@@ outh in the south of Scotland and will shortly visit both O@@ ban and C@@ amp@@ bel@@ town on the west coast
These are communities gra@@ vely affected by this crisis , but even worse is the situation in the north of Scotland
If we cannot do things adequately to help that industry it will collapse
Thus even when the cod stocks are restored , there will be no viable industry to go out and catch them
This is a vital part of a sustainable diet for Europeans in the future
We must have an adequate fishing industry
We must support it properly and , if we put up the money , our government in the United Kingdom must take it up
It has been said that they will not go cap in hand to the Commission looking for money
This is not cap in hand
The money is willingly being offered
Decisions and objectives of the recovery plans cannot disregard the social and economic consequences which they will have
Rec@@ o@@ very plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry
2003 is a repeat of 2002 is a repeat of 2001 is a repeat of 2000
Fishermen are now demanding emergency aid to compensate for losses incurred by coastal communities as a result of cod conservation measures , and I for one support them
Once again , fishermen disagree with the Commission
there is already talk about hake and sole in the Bay of Biscay
It is indisputable that some stocks of cod are , in many areas , in a vulnerable situation
However , by holding fishing solely responsible for that situation , the Commission risks condemning fishermen without replen@@ ishing the resources
Apart from this , we do , of course , support this resolution
Mr President , this document deals with employment strategy and social policy
I voted for it , naturally , but I should still like to make a point
I often hear it said by certain enlightened and important economists that employment strategy cannot be divorced from pensions strategy
If one talks about increasing employment in Europe , one should also be talking about reforming pensions for those in work
I must emphasise , however , Mr President , that one should call a spade a spade and say what one thinks
It is time people explained what they actually mean by what they say
Unfortunately , recent employment statistics for the European Union paint a very black picture
Employment rates are dropping in both Greece and Germany
Substantial measures must be taken at once to increase employment
First , if war in Iraq is averted , this will stimulate investment both globally and in the European Union , where it will impact on employment
Secondly , relaxing the Stability Pact will encourage government intervention to foster growth and employment
Thirdly , employment indicators need to be set so that , as with economic indicators , the Member States ' unemployment policies can be monitored and reinforced
The explanatory statement for this report welcomes the drop in unemployment at European level
Moreover , for several months , the number of unemployed has again been rising in all the countries of the Union
How could it be otherwise , when the most powerful industrial groups on the continent are announcing considerable reductions in their workforce and closing their factories one after another ?
I can therefore only oppose the report amended in this way , as it adopts neo-liberal principles in advocating an employment policy that ignores the person
Paragraph 23 makes a useful reference to the European social model
This model should be developed in order to safeguard social standards that are attractive to the rest of the world
In this context , the use of tax exemptions in high-@@ employability sectors ( public works , services , hotel and catering trade , etc
) should be integrated into the European social model
We welcome the fact that the report , with the proposals for amendments appended to it by the PPE-DE and Liberal Groups , has been rejected
We contributed to its rejection by voting against not only the most negative amendments but also against the final resolution
greater flexibility in current legislation in the labour field , which would lead to those seeking employment being offered various types of employment contracts and working time regul@@ ations;
As you can see from these few examples , the report 's approach was to insist on speeding up the implementation of neoliberal policies
I am therefore happy that Parliament has rejected it
Our vote is in line with the need for those running SMEs not to endure unnecessary tax burdens or inappropriate regulation
Increasing investment will not solve the problem as most investment is in technological equipment which cuts rather than creates jobs
Unfortunately , this report has not been approved
I would say that , through trying to reach a balance between so many conflicting points of view , the report ended up losing its own balance
The rapporteur suggests approaches that deserve to be supported and followed up
Following the conclusions of the Lisbon Summit , we have always stressed the need for a balance between quality and quantity
We have therefore made some real progress , and we must combat the scourge of unemployment
However , we need to be on our guard in relation to social plans , company restructuring , relocations and mass redundancies
We cannot be content with the precarious situation being experienced by an increasing number of our fellow citizens
Parliament has a real duty to guard against these things
Mr Mann has given the opposite message , which is unacceptable , by presenting us with an entirely neo-liberal profession of faith
We now need a real battle against poverty and in favour of employment
We do not accept casu@@ al , unqualified jobs , and we do not accept employees being placed in a precarious situation
On the contrary , we need to place the emphasis on training and qualifications , and support the most vulnerable
We need to be very vigilant on the employment of women , and we need to enable young people to enter the employment market with hope
We do not want the markets in the service trade to be deregulated and opened up unchecked
We will not sacrifice all our social heritage which has been acquired at such a high price
We are in favour of a European social policy that runs through all other development and growth policies pursued by the Union
It remains blind to the increase in unemployment , mass redundancies and sudden closures of companies
What crime have the employees of Me@@ tal@@ euro@@ pe committed ?
What sort of ' stability ' are we talking about when lives are shattered for the sake of being ' consistent with monetary policy ' ?
liberalisation of the markets requires sacrifices
I cannot support the invitation to ' further liberalise services of general interest (
) namely postal services , telecommunications , gas and electricity , rail and air transport , and broadcasting '
The cause it suggests is the ' rigidity of the European economy ' , which prevents it from ' reacting swiftly to external shocks '
The problem lies in what rigidity we are talking about
This ability is further weakened by the Community budget , which does not make up the shortfall in Member States ' redistribution and solidarity needs
The report insists on greater flexibility in pay and in the labour market , which contributes to pay disputes and to job instability
It wishes to see greater flexibility in the products market , in particular by pursuing the approach of privatising , liberalising and deregulating the markets
This report adopts the anti-grass roots policies of the ? U , which subvert the rights of the workers for the benefit of the monopolies
It openly maintains that the slump on the job market and the failure to fully apply flexible forms of work are one of the main causes of unemployment
5 % for 2003 ) , and yet the main concern is to strengthen the competitiveness and profitability of the European monopolies
We are opposed to these anti-grass roots policies and we stand by the workers in their fight to reverse them
The only aim of this report is for Parliament to unconditionally support the Commission 's plans
Like the García-Margallo and dos San@@ tos reports , on which we are also voting , the Trentin report promotes intelligent application of the Pact and the adjustments that this involves
However , it combines intelligence and stupidity in an incoherent approach that is trying to make things compatible with each other that are not
Clearly the structural reforms mentioned mean more precarious employment , globalised pensions and further privatisations
As we see no trace of such a possibility , we have voted against this report , which is only proposing inconsistent pat@@ ching up of the Pact
Above all , it is clear that the absolu@@ tisation of the Stability Pact is not only motivated by purely economic considerations , but is now a truly political aim
That approach is unacceptable
We therefore need to consider a way of making the S@@ G@@ P more flexible by introducing more sophisticated criteria
I have consequently voted in favour of this report
I voted against the report when item 15 was voted down by the political Left
The fact that item 15 has been removed makes room for la@@ xity in the Stability and Growth Pact
Instead , strict compliance with objective and measurable criteria should be required
The removal of item 15 opens the way for European finance ministers to increase public expenditure in times of recession and in situations in which there are budget deficits
There is a danger of this leading to increased inflation , a loss of confidence and a less stable EU currency
I voted in favour of item 5 to the effect that a possible introduction of the euro should be subject to a referendum
Sweden will not be forced to enter into economic and monetary union if the majority of voters support the Swedish k@@ ron@@ a
It is worth noting that this item was adopted on the basis of 4@@ 86 votes in favour , 3 against and 8 abstentions
I voted in favour of removing item 4 , that is to say against the Stability and Growth Pact 's being implemented in ' a more flexible way '
In practice , this item would entail a relaxation of the objective criteria in favour of vagu@@ er , politically negotiable criteria
Unfortunately , this item remained in place
The euro requires clear and stable rules
The decision means a reduction in confidence in the euro as a currency
I voted against item 10 to the effect that EC law takes precedence over Swedish law , even before Swedish legislation has been amended
The item would mean that the rules governing the way in which the Swedish constitution is amended would be circum@@ vented by EC law
Mr President , we are talking about the finances of the countries that have adopted the euro
Parliament is once again acting as a co@@ g in the machine of urgent demands from the college in Brussels
It goes without saying that I cannot accept such a possibility
That concludes the explanations of vote
( The sitting was suspended at 1
and resumed at 3 p
The minutes of yesterday 's sitting have been distributed
Thank you , Mr Posselt , for your comment , which has been noted so that the necessary action can be taken
The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the military mission of the Union in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
The President-in-Office of the Council and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece , Mr Pap@@ an@@ dre@@ ou , has the floor
I should like to convey my personal condolences to his family , his wife and children and , of course , the Serbian nation as a whole
However , this incident shows that we still have a long way to go
This operation is important on several counts
Secondly , this operation will help enhance the role and profile of the European Union in this country
It will , if you like , reinforce this country 's progress towards European integration within the context of the Stabilisation and Association Process
It will facilitate the application of the framework agreement
Consequently , preparations and the operation itself need to be completed with the utmost care
The European Union has taken over this operation subject to two basic preconditions
As far as the first precondition is concerned , permanent arrangements are nearing completion
Almost all the relevant draft texts have already been agreed by ? ? ? ? and transmitted to the European Union
The Greek Presidency has included the takeover of this mission in its basic priorities in the ESDP area and is therefore making every effort along these lines
We shall , of course , need to take over within the specific permanent arrangements agreed , in order to safeguard the autonomy of both organisations
The Council adopted the general idea of the operation on 23 January and the related joint action on 27 January
The institutional framework for the operation and , more importantly , the funding arrangements , are in place
The Political and Security Committee decided which third countries would be invited to participate on 4 February
On 7 February , the Deputy Supreme Al@@ lied Commander for Europe was appointed as operation comm@@ ander
It was decided that operational headquarters would be at S ? ? ? ?
The French force comm@@ ander was also appointed , given that France has been elected to act as framework nation
On the same day , the initial military guideline was issued to the operation comm@@ ander
The operation comm@@ ander has submitted a draft operational plan , including the rules of engagement administration and control structure and a statement of resource requirements , to the Military Committee
On 18 February , the Political and Security Committee therefore decided to set up a Con@@ tribu@@ tions Committee
Finally , the conference to set up the force was held on 20 February and the conference to appoint the force staff was held on 25 February
This decision will set the exact date on which the operation is taken over
It is expected to start officially before the end of the month , as soon as the outstanding issues I mentioned have been taken care of
Before closing , I should like , if I may , to comment on the objective , duration , size of the force and command of the operation
It is expected to last about six months
The end of the operation will depend on when the basic objective is achieved
The force numbers 4@@ 87 men , including 2@@ 12 staff positions
The structure and control of the operation are vital to the command of the operation
The Deputy Supreme Al@@ lied Commander for Europe has been appointed as operation comm@@ ander , and the European Union operational headquarters will be at S ? ? ? ?
As I said , France has been elected as the framework nation for the operation and will have the lead role in directing the operation
Bri@@ g@@ ad@@ ier@@ -General Mar@@ al has therefore been appointed as force comm@@ ander
However , ? ? ? ? will keep a supreme military representative at allied headquarters in Skopje and the two sta@@ ffs will therefore work in close collaboration
And now that it has come of age , the crisis management mechanism built up over the last four years can be implemented
This first operation is , I think , particularly important
Mr President , I wish to begin by associating myself wholeheartedly with all that the Foreign Minister has just said about the murder of Prime Minister D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic
I should like to extend my sympathy and , I am sure , the sympathy of the House to his family and friends and to all democrats in Serbia
In about one and a half hours I am supposed to be flying to Croatia
This means I shall miss the end of the next debate , which will be left in the capable hands of Commissioner Bolkestein
Tomorrow evening I had planned to fly to Belgrade
The first European Union military operation is , as the Foreign Minister has said , about to start operations in the Balkans
It is an historic step for the European Security and Defence Policy
All of us remember the tragic events which took place in south-east Europe at the beginning of the nineties
It is therefore not by chance that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is to be the setting for this new step forward by the European Union
The context of this operation is no longer the imperative to put an end to the civil conflict and to separate the fighters
During my first two years or so as a Commissioner I visited FYROM much more than any other place
In one period of just over a year I was in Macedonia almost ten times
A substantial and sustained commitment by the European Union - political as well as financial - supported the process
Thus we offered both a European perspective to the country through the Stabilisation and Association Process and through increased financial support
A few figures can illustrate how substantial our financial assistance package has been
More than EUR 30 million was allocated in 2001 through the CARDS programme and the Rapid Reaction Mechanism , while nearly EUR 7 million was delivered in humanitarian assistance
These funds have been focused on de-mining , housing reconstruction , local infrastructure rehabilitation , confidence-building measures and institutional reforms required under the Framework Agreement
This effort was quickly followed up by the adoption of a multiannual programme which , under CARDS , earmarked EUR 130
These efforts have been paying off
The last few months have shown that political life is returning to normal , based on the implementation of the Framework Agreement and on the Stabilisation and Association Process
It is true that the security situation is still fragile
This assessment is shared by the government , the President , the main political parties and international players
Here I would like to address some of the concerns which may have emerged regarding the scope and the objective of the European Union military mission
It will be a visible sign of our commitment to safeguarding stability in this country
Secondly , we do not need to have second thoughts
Our objectives are clear
It is fully consistent with our policy to contribute to the long-term security of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Let me just remind the House of the comprehensive package of financial assistance given by the Community in the security sector , under the justice and home affairs heading
2 million have been earmarked for this purpose
This encompasses two crucial elements in particular
The first is support for the country to manage its borders through a comprehensive integrated border management programme , which includes creating an effective border police corps
We know the journey is not an easy one and today 's tragedy reminds us how much work there still is for us to do
Whatever the tragic setbacks , I am sure that they will attain that objective in the years ahead
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , I too would like to express my sorrow at the murder of Mr D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ i ?
We should also see this as imposing on us the obligation of making an ongoing contribution to stability and democracy in the region
I believe that what we are discussing today is one of the steps to that end
This morning , we demonstrated what a poor position Europe is in when it comes to issues of war and peace
In the Balkans , we have learned from the mistakes of the past , and the European Union has taken on greater responsibilities
I believe we should take this as a favourable assessment , and so I would like to thank those who have been involved in making it possible
Right now , the European Union is planning a substantially larger operation for 2004 , which will involve taking over NATO 's SFOR missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina
Military operations by the European Union , such as are currently planned for the Balkans , differ in one very important respect from missions undertaken by NATO
NATO is a military alliance pure and simple , whereas the European Union is not
Cooperation between civilians and the armed forces under the flag of the European Union will always be an important dimension of the overall mission
This first mission in Macedonia sees us - even Parliament - breaking new ground
Let me also express the hope that this will not lead to disruption of the efforts towards greater stability in Serbia and in the former Yugoslavia as well
Let us return to the matter we are debating today
And within the wider Europe the Union is now itself taking direct responsibility for an important peacekeeping operation
The military mission must of course help make these positive developments permanent
It was therefore a question of finding the right formula with regard to the independent nature of the operation
In this case it is a matter in particular of practical cooperation with NATO , but also of a future lar@@ ger@@ -scale operation , in Bosnia-Herzegovina for example
Conflict prevention is one of the most important basic principles of European security and defence policy
It is now being put into practice ' militarily ' for the first time by an operation according to the rules
It is part of a broader package of political and economic measures in support of the stabilisation process in the region in question
It is therefore important that the requisite publicity be given to the mission
The resolution rightly focuses considerable attention on the question of democratic legitimacy or rather the absence of it
It is indeed disappointing to learn that in this unique instance Parliament has not really been consulted
The European Parliament is after all one of the European platforms for the monitoring and assessment of such peacekeeping operations
Mr President , progress towards stability in Macedonia is a real example of how cooperation between NATO , the EU and the US can have very beneficial effects
Commissioner Patten is absolutely right to say that the European Union has got its act together to a considerable extent in the Balkans
I also congratulate the coalition government in place since last September
Let us hope that Macedonia has indeed turned a corner and that the O@@ h@@ rid Agreement will be fully implemented
A military presence is still necessary to deliver a secure atmosphere and the EU mission can and should carry out tasks such as weapons collection and training
For the EU to undertake its first military operation is a truly significant and historic milestone
Mr Brok is quite right to insist that it should not happen without consultation with the European Parliament
The fact that the fin@@ alisation of the details has been held up by wrangling over intelligence sharing between NATO and the EU is said to be purely a technical issue
It is illustrative of the interdependence between the two and what we have at stake in making this agreement work
It is right for the EU to take over from NATO and a convincing demonstration that we are serious about playing a larger security role
There can be no economic progress or investment while lawlessness is rife
there is a very close link between security and the growth of the economy
I would like to mention again the problem of the name
The President-in-Office and the Commissioner use the formulation of FYROM - the former Yugoslavia Republic of Macedonia
I wish these negotiations over the name could get somewhere - they seem to drag on
Finally , I would like to urge those Member States that have not yet ratified the Stabilisation and Association Agreement , to get on with it
This would send a very good signal to Macedonia
diplomacy , the prevention of conflicts and , when that succeeded , investment in the reconstruction of both infrastructure and institutions
I do not agree with this viewpoint or with this dismis@@ sive gesture
Of course it was only a small-scale conflict
In addition to the fine words about what can be done , two warnings
These have already been referred to by my fellow Members
We in the European Union cannot continue in future to send servic@@ em@@ en without any parliamentary control whatever being exercised
We cannot go on this way
Let us be honest , it is and it will be a hugely difficult point
Then the European Union will finally be able to intervene with a wide range of options , preferably to prevent conflicts and if necessary to manage crises
Allow me to conclude with a few words about the dreadful murder of Prime Minister D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic in Serbia
I therefore fervently hope that the Commissioner will be able to go to Serbia to put to the Serbian Parliament his message of solidarity with the democratic forces in Serbia
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , this operation in Macedonia has just been presented as an historic phase in the commitment of the European Union
I think that we need to set our sights slightly lower than this ambitious presentation
First of all because , in terms of quantity , it is relatively small
It is a mission involving , if we have rightly understood , 500 men , including those in command
Then , because we have not been able to reach an agreement on extremely precise objectives
We are not even capable of agreeing on the name of this country , and I am pleased to be speaking before the Greek Foreign Minister
In short , contrary to what the Committee on Foreign Affairs pur@@ ports , the mission is not really taking over from NATO
It will be led by the supreme command of the Al@@ lied forces in Europe from its headquarters , S@@ H@@ AP@@ E
It is using NATO resources
I do not think that this is really something we should welcome
Apart from that , Mr Gollnisch , I take the view that our taking over from NATO responsibility for the mission in Macedonia is an historic event
It is for that reason that I believe this to be an important step on the road that leads to a European defence policy
For the first time , the EU is taking on responsibility for the military side of peacekeeping in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
What functions do parliaments have to perform in operations of this kind ?
It is one of the principles of democratic politics that military operations may be mounted only with the mandate of a directly elected parliament
For Macedonia , these mandates were provided by the national parliaments
Those in positions of political leadership must ensure that the troops on the ground are not exposed to unnecessary dangers - and what gives rise to these ?
They come about as a result of the wrong orders being given or of inadequate leadership and equipment
This consideration leads me to put a number of questions to the Council , and also to the Commission
For a start , what difference will it make that American troops are no longer to be deployed in Macedonia ?
Might not the loss of certain capacities expose our soldiers to danger ?
My second question concerns the way in which decisions are implemented
Thirdly , I turn to costs , on which I have questions about both the civilian and military sides of this mission
Mr President , I too am utterly at a loss to understand the murder of Mr D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ i ? , the prime minister of Serbia
Only a few months ago , I was able to have a long conversation with him in his official residence in Belgrade
He took significant steps to bring Serbia closer to Western fundamental values , not only in terms of its political system , but also of its society
Whatever it is in Serbia and Montenegro that lies behind this assassination , this demonstrates how precarious the situation there is
There is also a precarious situation in the surrounding areas , as the killings in the Presevo valley remind us
Peace has not yet been established
The assassination of Mr D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ i ? has yet again made that abundantly clear to us
I also very much endorse the progressive Europe@@ anisation - yes , let us call it that - of current security policy and of the military intervention in the Balkans
That is why I regard this course of action as absolutely right and crucial , trivial though it may at present appear to be
Mr President-in-Office , Commissioner , you are aware of that
It will , during this stage , be increasingly important to have due regard to the European Union 's institutions and to remain within the bounds of its institutional structures
This is a new measure agreed on in November
I see this as an important decision and as complementing that on the political principle of involving Parliament
This example shows how we are already involved in this area
The Serbian leaders have recently been surrounding themselves with high-level security , in the knowledge that the greatest danger is just when steps towards normalisation start speeding up
The murder of Zor@@ an D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic has , amongst other things , implications for the tabling of certain amendments to the resolution we are about to put to the vote
I think the two-@@ month period requested for the European Community for initial monitoring of the results of the mission is too short
That is clearly the case and we should take it into account
Now , however , we have gone into Macedonia and , for better or for worse , we must clarify certain points and discuss them in this House
We have learnt something during the last hour and perhaps we shall learn something later on that we do not yet know
Military expenditure is the responsibility of the national parliaments , but the European Union should manage the financial operations on joint bases and Parliament should then perform its monitoring role
One of its key aims is to remove American involvement in European security
The primary instrument of this policy is ESDP which otherwise sensible European states have been ho@@ od@@ win@@ ked into supporting
They have been given a false prospectus
The existence of this separate ESDP has undoubtedly been a factor in weakening the coherence of the NATO alliance , contributing to the recent very damaging disagreements
By the way , for Mr Gollnisch 's information , there are only 30 American personnel in the Macedonian force , and none of them are combat troops
The fact is that the EU 's R@@ ur@@ it@@ anian takeover of the NATO operation in FYROM will not contribute any additional military assets
It merely opens the opportunity for political division between European and North American allies at the very time when they should all be sitting around the same table
How much simpler if France were merely to rejoin the integrated military structure of the alliance and then everyone would be happy
We need to bring Europe 's military contribution back into the NATO fold and start rebuilding the common western strategic culture before it is too late
We believe in the important role of the European Parliament and in transparent , informative relations
I think this shows that our common foreign policy has come of age , in this region at least , and will be important as we develop it further
I should also like to emphasise that the problems in the Balkans are very complicated
I should also like to say something in my capacity as Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs
As far as the name is concerned , none of us is happy with the name the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
This name does , of course , need to be finalised as quickly as possible and negotiations are in fact under way at the UN
Unfortunately the idea of ' Great Macedonia ' existed until recently and hence the term ' Macedonia ' had clear conno@@ tations of changing borders and assimil@@ ating territory from neighbouring countries
Fortunately , this has been dealt with@@ ; we have gone beyond this historical aspect at least
More importantly , there has been a spectacular improvement in bilateral relations between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia over recent years
This proves there is a need for multilateral cooperation , for close cooperation in dealing with crisis at international level
Where we have this sort of cooperation , this sort of coordination , we are , I think , more efficient
I have taken Mr Laschet 's comments on the parliamentary assembly of the Western European Union on board
I too am in contact with the upper ec@@ hel@@ ons of the Western European Union and these are issues that will be discussed during the debate on the future of Europe
First of all , the European Union 's decision-making mechanism , the ES@@ D ? mechanism , is being tested for the first time , especially as regards military operations
As regards the military operation and any dangers inherent in it , naturally unavoidable dangers are inherent in any military operation
The ? ? ? ? staff in Skopje will continue to operate , as will KFOR Re@@ ar
This being the case , and given the assessments made so far , we consider the risk to be relatively low
Of course , it would be useful if future operations under the ESDP could be funded from the Union budget , but that requires institutional reform
On that note , Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I should like to thank you for listening
Rest assured that I am at your disposal , time permitting , and I fully intend to keep you abreast of any procedures , decisions or developments in this area
The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon
The next item is the Commission statement on the transfer of personal data by airlines to the US immigration service
Let me now turn to the business in hand
The basic aim is to prevent terrorist acts by detecting potential perpetrators before they enter the country
In this context , the United States Congress has required that carriers make passenger name record information available to US Customs upon request
Nevertheless , the United States measures have raised concern with regard to the respect of Community and Member States ' laws on data protection
Moreover , airlines not in compliance ris@@ ked being seen as higher security risks , with potential consequences for significant falls in passenger numbers
The stakes , therefore , were very high and the consequences of not acting would have been extremely serious
Further talks took place on 4 March , as a result of which the United States has given additional undertakings with respect to the handling and protection of sensitive data
I am also aware that questions have been raised as to the legal basis for the action undertaken so far by the Commission
This , as my colleague Commissioner Bolkestein will explain in more detail , seems to be founded on a misunderstanding
There has been no ' agreement ' and no ' decision ' so far
Both sides are now committed to continuing their discussions in order to find a more legally secure solution
Following comitology procedures , the draft Commission decision will then have to be discussed by this House before being finalised
I should like to make one final personal remark
The whole House recognises how the events of 11 September produced a real feeling of vulnerability and shock in the United States
Like a number of honourable Members , I come from a country which has also had to take steps to deal with terrorist threats
That said , I hope that we can engage the United States at a much earlier stage in the policy-making process in discussing these security issues
There should be no difference between us at all on the importance of putting in place security measures which are recognised as being reasonable by both sides
It would be easier to do that if we could talk more openly and earlier about these sorts of measures
Commissioner , I would like to take this opportunity to assure you that it was not the intention of the Chair to exclude you from taking the floor
However , we were informed that owing to constraints of time you had to leave earlier
Mr President , this is of course a Commission statement , but on a very important issue , an issue with political implications
Do you not think that the Council should be present at this issue and should be able to express an opinion , if it so wishes ?
Mr Alavanos , I have , of course , noted your comment and we shall investigate exactly what is going on
However , it was agreed at the outset that the Commission would make statements on this issue
Mr President , I should like to add the following to what Commissioner Patten has just said
It is necessary to pull all these strands together and to strike an appropriate balance
The Commission very much welcomes the opportunity to address Parliament on this matter
Under@@ lying the technical issues are some fundamental questions about security and civil liberties which all democracies have to ask themselves
Discussions amongst elected parliamentarians on such issues is essential
The motion for a resolution before Parliament criticises the Commission for not informing and consulting Parliament sooner
The Commission accepts this re@@ prim@@ and
It had no intention to conceal
It was more a question of when to bring this matter to the attention of Parliament and in what form
We only have a short time
Rather than making a lengthy factual statement I will draw the attention of Parliament to two documents which the Commission has made available
The second document is the statement by US Customs of 4 March which gives undertakings as regards the handling of sensitive data
It is necessary to correct a misunderstanding
As my distinguished colleague Commissioner Patten has just said , many reports referred to an agreement or a decision
I stress that there is no agreement , there is no decision
It follows that , at this moment , there is no legal basis
There have been discussions and the US side has given certain assurances
This is the first step in the process
Both sides are committed to finding a more legally secure solution in due course
These discussions are necessary
Unfortunately the American side was very slow to respond to these requests for information and they only started to take our concerns seriously in December 2002
In the absence of discussions with the United States , the airlines - as Commissioner Patten has already explained - would have been left in an impossible situation
They would have faced a whole range of penalties , starting with the practice of secondary inspections of arriving passengers
That meant very long delays at arrival points for hundreds , if not thousands , of legitimate travellers
That is an option , but is it what we really want ?
It is certainly not what the airlines wanted , and there was every likelihood that these airlines would have complied with American requirements anyway
But not having discussions with the American side would have left them with the data and no means for the European Union side to influence their handling of it
It would have left the airlines open to either US or Member States ' enforcement action when they - the airlines - are the wrong target
If we want to bring pressure to bear it should be on those who can deliver a solution - and that is not the airlines
The Commission considers that the outcome of the February talks was positive for data protection for the following two reasons
Firstly , we secured US agreement on the further steps to be taken to reach a mutually satisfactory solution that would and can provide legal certainty to all concerned
The second reason is that the United States made a number of significant , unilateral undertakings of immediate application
For example they made undertakings on what data they would not use and how they would handle the data they do use
They confirmed in particular that their data gathering would be limited to flights to , from or through the US
Clearly we need more time and information from the United States before we can say that we have a solution
We can only be satisfied when we have an arrangement which provides a maximum amount of legal security for all concerned
There are in the meantime transfers of data
Only the courts can answer that question in a definitive way , but I would like to make two points in this respect
Secondly , legality has to be examined from the angle of the need for adequate protection for data that is transferred to a third country
Trans@@ fers may however benefit from one of the exceptions in Article 26 of the Directive
Since such an exception could be challenged , however , this solution lacks legal security
Moreover , although exceptions may be legal for specific transfers , they offer no guarantees that the data will subsequently be protected
Moreover , Article 25 decisions always contain safeguard clauses which can be triggered if protection does not in practice match up to the standards expected
Finally , an Article 25 decision is a Community procedure , producing a result that is binding on all Member States
It is very much to be preferred to leaving Member States to act in dispersed order
It is worth mentioning that one or two Member States have or are planning measures very similar to those in place in the United States
That I think is a major step forward
Of course the United States still must provide the elements needed for the Commission to make such an adequacy finding
As a comitology decision , an adequacy finding under Article 25 is always brought to Parliament before being finalised , as was also explained by Mr Patten
I certainly look forward to discussing this further with Members of Parliament on a future occasion
In the current situation , the airlines are facing considerable uncertainty
This is also a requirement laid down in Article 7 of our Charter of Fundamental Rights
Mr President , I fully agree with what Mr Hernández Mollar has said
Thus , a fundamental right of European citizens is now at risk
Otherwise , I believe the European Parliament will have to consider appealing to the Court of Justice to ensure protection for the citizens of Europe
Mr President , Commissioner Bolkestein invited us to take a positive view of the Commission 's action in the 17 February joint statement
It is dis@@ ingenuous to try to claim that it is not an agreement
It is called a joint statement and it is also referred to in the text as an understanding of both sides which will be implemented
That , in plain English , is surely an agreement
This is a stun@@ ning rebu@@ ff to the Commission
He said in essence that National Data Protection Commissioners and courts were not free to suspend application of relevant laws just on the sa@@ y-@@ so of the Commission
It is a reminder to the Commission that if it will not be the guardian of Community law , then others have to be
The political groups are in wide agreement on this matter
The PPE-DE Group has not signed this amendment , and I understand they believe it would leave the airlines exposed
However , the Article 29 Working Party has stated that they are exposed anyway to sanction for breach of data protection legislation
The basic problem is that the US has no data protection laws
This is a problem for the Europol Agreement and the EU-US Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement
There is huge concern about the balance between security and civil liberties being ti@@ pped too far towards security in the United States
We need an Article 25 decision after consultation of this House
The Commission may have tried its best , but it did the wrong thing
He disappeared for five hours because he was being interrog@@ ated by the FBI
They gra@@ bbed him with no explanation whatsoever and they let him go with no explanation whatsoever
Who do the United States think they are ?
And where does this leave the European Union ?
Why does the European Union have data protection laws ?
How can we stand by while the United States imposes fines on airlines for wanting to apply the laws of the European Union ?
How humiliating is that ?
This will really have to be solved another way
Pri@@ v@@ acy is not an obstacle , but an essential part of security
De@@ aling care@@ lessly with the privacy of our citizens jeopardises the basic trust of the people in their government and in the constitutional state and then we are worse off
But then agreements must also be made about what data we exchange , which authorities have access to them and how long they may be retained
US Customs may pass the data on to other authorities that are concerned with combating terrorism
Now the Commission is really pleased because the Americans have made a solemn undertaking not to use data about religion and health
Does it mean that while they do have access to these data , they have simply undertaken not to do anything with them ?
Even meal preferences can say something about a person
I myself have been vegetarian for years and years , even on aircraft
For people who do not like this , a European Commission spokesman had good advice
'@@ The choice is clear , ' he said , ' either you do not go to the United States , or you go for the sand@@ w@@ ich option
Do you , Commissioner , endorse this advice , and do you also think it so enormously fun@@ ny ?
Now the small print on an aircraft ticket is one thing , but do passengers really have any other option ?
Mr President , I would otherwise like to associate myself with the many comments of my fellow Members about the precise technical and legal problems with this
We for our part say that the exchange of data must stop immediately
This is how it works in a partnership between well-meaning countries
you say it is not a question of a legislative act , a Community act
the Commission is saying ' Do not intervene
' regarding those airlines that are transferring data in compliance with US legislation
This is why Parliament must continue down this road , and I also believe it will strengthen the Commission and the Community institutions
Mr President , this is an unfortunate situation , of that there can be no doubt
At the same time , the United States have taken a threatening stand
They are threatening to take measures against our airlines if they fail to do as they are told , which is hardly what one expects from friends and allies
This is just the latest in a series of incidents over recent years , especially lately , incidents which often have what might well be seen as com@@ ic@@ -@@ tragic over@@ tones
Its intention was to take certain steps in order to deal with a difficult situation it was facing
The Commission , on the other hand , tells us that these are simply misunderstandings
I must say that , now that these misunderstandings have been cleared up , I am even more concerned
You tell us that the airlines are being pres@@ sured by the action of the United States Administration , which is forcing them to breach European legislation
If this is the case , the airlines have the right to claim protection from their authorities , as do , it goes without saying , the Union 's citizens
The Commissioner says that no agreement or decision has been reached and that , therefore , there is no legal basis for such action
I genuinely believe that this is an acceptance of blackmail and I find this situation surprising
Is the European Union unable to respond in a reciprocal way , to say that some things are not acceptable and might face counter@@ measures ?
In my view , this is unacceptable and this attitude must change
Mr President , the Commissioner has said that there is no agreement and no decision , but there is an interim rule
My question therefore is how long can such an interim rule be valid and how must we view it ?
Protection of personal data is a fundamental right under Article 7 of the EU 's Charter of Fundamental Rights
It is probably also going to form part of our European constitution
So this is a very serious matter
All this is also laid down in our directives and in particular Directive 95/@@ 4@@ 6/@@ EEC
It also contains exceptions that we could meet
In my opinion this has not been satisfied either
I have listened carefully to the Commissioner , who has said that he has done his best to find a balance between maintaining privacy and protecting the airlines
I have some sympathy for that , but I nonetheless believe that he has gone the wrong way about it
There is no democratic legitimacy and agreements have been concluded that could not be tested by the representative body
At the moment my position is that the measures in their present form must be suspended
I am just as incapable as my fellow MEPs of expressing such a positive view
The big picture in this matter is , of course , specifically the United States ' relations with the surrounding world
There are , however , a number of legal principles involved here that we cannot dispense with , and the Commission 's efforts to uphold these legal principles are pitiful
What is described in the paper from the Article 29 Group is certainly alarming
Data is passed on not merely to immigration authorities but to other federal bureaux
It is , then , no longer specifically protected , as it ought to be according to American legislation
I might add one question and one answer
The question , raised by the Commissioner , was as to whether this matter could be sorted out using a comitology procedure
In my view , the matter necessarily revolves around an agreement pursuant to Article 24 - cf
also Article 38 - of the Treaty on European Union , which unfortunately means that Parliament is made redundant since it has no influence upon decisions of this kind
All the more reason , then , for informing the public in advance
The United States on 5 March enacted a law that has indisputable consequences for the citizens of the European Union , for data protection and for EU legislation
The US enacted this law without concluding the necessary bilateral or multilateral negotiations and without entering into an agreement with the Union
This - as you yourself indicated , Commissioner - has led to a problem with the airlines , which are caught in a double bind
If they do not pass on any data , they have difficulties over landing rights , leading to business problems
But if they do pass on the data as required , they run the danger of infringing EU law and being taken to court
So a horrendous problem has arisen here
This procedure is quite simply unacceptable
An opportunity has been missed here - yesterday was the first time we were informed of this
However , we also expect that cooperation with the United Nations in the fight against terror should continue , but on a proper legal footing
We all know that we can only win the war on terror by means of international cooperation
We are therefore committed to cooperation with the United States , but let me make this clear once more - only if our rights are defended
Mr President , Commissioner , I am pleased that we have witnesses here today to hear us - their visit to the European Parliament will have served a useful purpose
It is already clear that we need to fight terrorism
None of us will refuse if the measures proposed are reasonable
Especially since 11 September we have been aware of the need for vigilance on our planet and the need to take appropriate measures at any given time
It is our task as Members , as representatives of the people , to take our electors ' and our citizens ' interests seriously and to defend them
We are not just talking about the airlines ' interests here
Up to now they have always assumed that constitutional arrangements apply in the European Union and that data about them is sacrosanct
Mr President , Commissioner , once again I wish to contradict the previous speaker
He needs to get a sense of proportion
Nothing is being hushed up here , the public is being told about this
I shall try to look at this whole issue from the standpoint of the airlines and their passengers for once
Because of the general recession , Europe 's airlines were already in trouble before 11 September
The events of 11 September and the period that followed caused enormous problems not only for all European airlines but also for airlines in the US
As you will have read over the last few days , even American Airlines may have to file for Chapter 11 protection
So the airlines find themselves in an extremely difficult situation
This will also have an impact on airports and on employment
It therefore has to be said that there is no point in disrupting air traffic between the USA and Europe over the next few weeks because of arguments of principle
We need to ensure that we can find a constitutional and practical solution to this problem
So to that extent the allegation that the Americans would regularly misuse data passed to them is quite simply mistaken
What we do of course need , Mr Bolkestein , is clear answers from you
How do you intend to achieve legal certainty that the US authorities will only receive data needed to fight terrorism and no other data ?
You need to guarantee that by means of unambiguous agreements with the Americans
That is the reason for my two other questions about the extent to which you are prepared to negotiate with the Americans
Which of the two possible legal solutions you have identified do you actually intend to pursue now , and how long will that take ?
I believe that in the present difficult situation faced by the airlines we cannot afford effectively to provoke an interruption of air traffic between the US and Europe
Mr President , the fight against terrorism is necessary , but not all means are permitted
That is a very simple basic principle
You cannot play games with democratic legitimacy and the credibility of politics
This is the way things would go if Parliament were to acqui@@ es@@ ce in the agreement between the Commission and the United States
That according to Commissioner Bolkestein it should now all of a sudden not be allowed to be called an agreement does not make things any better
The European Commission , as I said , has overstepped the mark
In the first place it has failed to keep to its own plan to test its own action in advance against Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights
In addition , as guardian of the Treaties , the Commission is under an obligation to uphold existing European legislation , in respect of data protection in this case
As earlier speakers have already explained in detail I shall not repeat it everything is inconsistent with everything else
This action lacks any legal foundation , is completely non-transparent and uncontrollable
The Commission must therefore re@@ trace its steps and take action to defer the agreement 's entry into force
If the agreements are properly tested against the European rules , a proper agreement can be concluded rather than this half-baked effort that jeopardises legal security
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , we are living in times in which the United States of America persists in adopting undesirable unilateral initiatives
It is unacceptable for that country to impose measures on airlines unilaterally and on pain of severe sanctions
I agree with all the speakers who have emphasised that something is wrong in the relationship between the Commission and Parliament
It took fifteen months for the Commission to submit the matter to Parliament
Consequently , airlines face a real risk of being taken to court , as a result of complaints from passengers whose personal details have been forwarded to the US authorities
The directive on data protection lays down that personal data can only be forwarded to third countries if adequate protection is in place
Have the United States given us sufficient guarantees that this data will be protected ?
Mr President , we all reject and condemn terrorism and its criminal acts
We support the US objective of preventing and combating terrorism and we roundly condemn the appalling acts of 11 September 2001
These acts were intolerable for their blind violence and because they affected innocent citizens
We do not believe , however , that the end justifies the means
Our respect for US law must be based on mutual respect for our own legal system
Our fight for security cannot and must not call freedom into question
Mr President , those sympathetic to the United States also have cause to criticise legislation that forces airlines to choose between the EU and the United States
It is good that the attempt has been made to bring about legal guarantees , but this has unfortunately been unsuccessful
A form of technical data protection has , however , been established , which is obviously quite effective , and perhaps as effective as it can be
As we all know , legislation must balance personal privacy and the fight against crime
The United States has also introduced unreasonable storage periods for information , apparently based upon the notion that each of us is some kind of potential criminal
There is a period of ten years in the case of ordinary citizens and of 50 years for those who are under suspicion
This must be seen in the perspective of our discussions in the EU of a one-year storage period
Our points of view are oceans apart
It would of course be more sensible to delete information once it has served its purpose and once it has been used
Global discussions are obviously required in this case , and not only with the United States
Rather , we also need to hold discussions with other countries in the world that have special rules
It would probably be a good idea if the Commission were also to make use of Parliament , which can in actual fact contribute to this discussion
I believe that Commissioner Patten has understood this in as much as he talked about Parliament 's and the Commission 's needing to join forces
What is at issue here ?
The aim is to protect people
People are , then , also entitled to know what information has been given out to whom and how it is used
This is also a good example of the discussion in the Convention and of the need for people to be able to demand political accountability
It clearly shows that this is the way matters stand
In conclusion , I hope that my fellow MEPs will give very strong backing to this resolution so that our voice is heard in the Commission
We are perhaps heard already , but our voice must also be heard across the Atlantic and lead to joint talks prior to legislation 's being introduced
In that way , we shall obtain legal guarantees and be able to combat crime
respecting someone means talking with them in time
They immediately appropriated the data , even threatening companies that did not provide the information with a fine of EUR 1000 per person
The Commission has also said that this would have prevented long que@@ ues for passengers arriving at the various destinations in the United States
Well , the Commission 's duty would have been promptly to inform the citizens of Europe and the European Parliament , which would automatically have acted as a sounding board
I would say that this too is a moment of serious discourtesy
We ask the Commission what the legal basis is for this agreement and what European interests are safeguarded in this case
I have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 37 , of the Rules of Procedure
Mr President , I shall do my best to answer the most important questions and remarks addressed to me
It is difficult to be brief as this is a complicated and important subject
I should like to stress that this seems mutually satisfactory to the Commission , the European Parliament and the European side
I say this in particular to Mrs Buitenweg , who insisted that our norms should be the touchstone for the acceptability of any agreement that might be achieved in future
It must be a mutually satisfactory solution
The American side has accepted that
Secondly , the American side has given a number of significant unilateral undertakings of immediate application
For example , they gave undertakings on what data they would not use and how they would handle the day-to-day ' do use '
In particular , data gathering would be limited to flights to , from or through the United States
Our discussions so far have yielded this result
We have not yet reached the end of the road - far from it
We have not yet achieved an agreement
The discussions with the United States will continue , I hope as quickly and as energetically as possible
It is premature to say that the Commission has failed and that it should have achieved more than it has
On behalf of Commissioner Patten and Commissioner de Palacio , who deals with transport , I must reject those criticisms
It has been pointed out that , although there is no agreement as yet , the effect is nonetheless that data is being accessed where it was not accessed before
It is clear that in the absence of discussions the airlines would have provided the data anyway
The airlines know that the US airlines and US@@ -based reservations systems are already doing this
That is a very important point which may have been overlooked in the heat of the debate
It is not simply a question of letting the data be transferred or preventing this , much of it is flowing anyway
Therefore it seems to me that the suggestion which has been made that we should take the airlines to the European Court of Justice is not a very productive suggestion
The airlines are , as Baroness Ludford said , between a rock and a hard place
They know that the American side is serious about imposing penalties , including some that could put their transatlantic traffic at risk
The counter@@ balancing threat - namely that the Commission would start infringement proceedings , legal action for breaches of the data protection rules - was a serious concern for the airlines
However , some of them have said that is not life-threatening , whereas the American threats are
A number of speakers have mentioned the supply of information to European Union citizens
Under data protection law , as I am sure Members know , the first duty to inform data subjects lies with data controllers
In this case that is the airlines and possibly travel agents
A duty of information also lies with the American Government
They also have a duty to inform the public so that potential travellers can make an informed choice
It concerns the direct application of the Directive to US Customs that give the European Directive a clear extraterr@@ itorial effect
In any event this question only arises when US Customs have direct access to the airlines ' databases
Furthermore , the question has been raised in particular by Mrs Buitenweg and also by other Members of Parliament about meals taken on aircraft
That is bad practice in terms of data protection
Mr Santini and Mr Jarzembowski referred to this aspect of the case
Even our Directive says that certain efforts are not mandatory where they are disproportionate to the results they achieve for data protection
These are some of the more substantial points which were raised by Members of Parliament
In addition to these points , with respect to a suggestion made by Mrs Paciotti , the possibility of using 25 , i
a finding of adequacy , is of course available
A question has also been raised about discussions to be held at political level
On the other hand I would like to say that it is not always the political input that provides a solution
After all , the staff - certainly in the case of the services that work under my supervision - are extremely able people
Various Members of Parliament have spoken about the suspension of the American measures
After all it concerns millions of passengers per year and we cannot afford to put that in jeopardy
Mr Jarzembowski has said that we must have a practical solution , with a proper legal basis , in cooperation with the United States
I agree entirely with him and the Commission will make every effort to achieve that practical solution , firmly based on the law
I hope to be able to discuss further developments in this area with Parliament as appropriate
The next item is Question Time
We shall examine Questions to Council
Mr Ortuondo , you have the floor on a point of order
Mr President , I wish to ask a question and , depending on the answer , perhaps lodge a complaint
Who is responsible , in Question Time , for determining the order in which questions are answered ?
The person with ultimate responsibility is Parliament 's President
If you will allow me , Mr President , I wish to make a complaint
During the February part-session , it was decided to cancel Question Time
My question to Council was tabled as No 3
When it was announced that Question Time was to be cancelled , we were told that these questions would be answered in March
It is now March and my question , which was then No 3 , is now No 22
This is discrimination
I wish to protest to you , Mr President , and I wish to ask you for your help
It is hard for the President of a sitting to help in these situations
You will receive a letter from the Secretary-General giving a detailed explanation
In any event , Mr Ortuondo , Mr Nogueira , I would ask you to keep your points of order brief
I have already received an answer from the Secretary-General , but it does not answer my question
All I want is an answer
Why should a question that was listed as No 3 in February become No 22 in March ?
I promise that I shall do everything within my power to ensure that you receive an answer
Mr President , I am one of a group of Members who have tabled questions to the Council
We naturally attempt to receive answers here in plenary and we fail to understand what criterion is used
Should we not be told the political criterion so that we can act accordingly ?
I would ask you to write to the services responsible for this Question Time if you wish to receive a detailed answer
This will not affect the right of Members to receive answers now
Questions Nos 1 and 3 will not be answered because the subjects they address already appear on the agenda for this part-session
Mr Posselt has the floor on a point of order
Mr President , Question No 2 has not been dealt with today
Kosovo has got nothing at all to do with Macedonia and Iraq
I have now been sitting here for half an hour , and I have waited from 5
Mr Posselt , I said Questions Nos 1 and 3 , not Question No 2
If gradual steps are not taken to clarify Kosovo 's future status it may prove difficult to stabilise society in and secure investment for the region
What thoughts does the Council Presidency have on this matter ?
The European Union is determined to help Kosovo become a democratic , prosperous society , in which all communities learn to live together in peace and security
Mr President , I would first like to apologise
The interpretation referred to Questions Nos 1 to 3 , which is why I asked to speak
So the reason was an error in the interpreting
Please accept my apology
But I would now like to put my question to the President-in-Office , whom I wish to thank for his very concrete and helpful reply
I have two short supplementary questions
The first is to ask what you think of the idea of simply setting up a working group to consider the options for the future of Kosovo
That would give us a preventive role and stop us from once again reacting only when it was too late
I would like to ask whether the European Union or the United Nations have protested against this
I ask because this would prejudice the chances of keeping open the future status of Kosovo
We all know which UN resolution I mean , so there is no need for me to refer to it at this point
It is Security Council Resolution 1244
Minister , you tell us that we need to wait
We have just learnt of the assassination in Belgrade of Prime Minister D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic
Many European capitals felt we had to wait for the arrest of the war criminals M@@ lad@@ ic and Kar@@ ad@@ zic
In Kosovo , the situation has certainly not impro@@ ved; relations between the Serb minority and the Koso@@ vo@@ -@@ Albanian majority are not improving
Could we not , as we did with the Cyprus issue , begin to look calmly at scenarios such as those indicated by Mr Posselt ?
Do you have more precise information on this subject ?
That is why we talk of standards before status
If it does not , the situation may become explosive
The provisions of this agreement are intended to supplement the provisions of the bilateral agreements signed by the US and the Member States of the European Union
Negotiations are still under way
Just two days ago a federal appeals court rejected attempts to clarify the legal situation of some Guantanamo Bay detainees , including two Brit@@ ons
In these circumstances , how can we trust the American criminal justice and law enforcement system ?
Should you not be consulting the European Parliament before making the agreements that the Council intends to make ?
Secondly , I should like to point out that a dialogue has opened with the United States on a series of human rights issues , such as the death penalty
What has the Council done to ensure that the Commission has adequate powers of negotiation in this regard ?
The Council , to be specific the Transport , Telecommunications and Energy Council , followed precisely this approach in its conclusions on 6 December 2002
It approved conclusions on the maritime security and the prevention of pollution following the accident of the oil tanker Prestige off the coast of Galicia
It is very important that we ensure , for example , that double hulls are used with shipments of oil , but that is not enough in all situations
It is approximately 30 metres deep on average and conditions are very difficult
In other words , what is adequate in such a situation would be determined by the Member State whose port the vessel is entering
I understand the conditions that prevail in the Baltic Sea and the freezing conditions she referred to
What is the Presidency 's view on this matter ?
What initiative does it intend to take ?
Why does it not establish compulsory rules for maritime traffic , such as those that exist for air and land traffic ?
I thank the honourable Member for his questions
He referred to US legislation and to the mandatory obligation to apply rules like those in the highway code
I have just two comments
In reply to your second question , as I said earlier , the European Union cannot solve this problem alone
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I heartily support the Council 's attempts to promote the safety of sea transport in the International Maritime Organisation
It is important to move forward via the international community
My question , however , actually concerns whether it would be possible to raise this issue of fuel shipments , particularly in the Baltic , at the next EU-Russia summit
I know that the Baltic states are particularly interested and I am sure that we shall be addressing this in due course
What measures will the Council propose for this EP recommendation to be implemented as quickly as possible ?
The Council takes account of Parliament 's resolutions and endorses most of the principles contained in them
To be precise , the Council endorsed the objective of banning sub@@ standard ships from European Union waters
The Commission may take the initiative and propose special measures for ships sailing under so-called flags of convenience
Current legislation allows port state controls to be stepped up on the basis of the criteria for classifying sub@@ standard ships
These criteria are laid down in the Paris M@@ em@@ orandum of Under@@ standing and include the ship 's flag
This is one of the priority issues for the Greek Presidency over coming months
It has been discussed and will be discussed at forthcoming Councils
How does he imagine we are going to replace those several thousand vessels in order that we can continue to provide Europe with its heavy fuel oils ?
I merely think that the two need to go hand in hand and we expect and will support proposals at the Commission 's initiative
The Council is prepared to examine all these specific cases , be it double hulls or the specific problem of shipping crude oil and heavy gra@@ des
We are prepared to do what we can to promote regulations for us and , of course , at international level
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I agree with you when you state that the laws of the International Maritime Organisation must be changed
What we must do now , however , is seek an appropriate strategy with which to do this
We already have the US Oil Pollution Act , which is a step in the right direction
The best strategy for amending , for changing international legislation is to pass a specific European law
The rest will follow as an inevitable consequence
Why not give this a try ?
Could it perhaps be because some Member States such as the United Kingdom , the Netherlands and Greece are opposed , as happened at the Copenhagen Council ?
We must bear in mind that there have been no accidents in the United States in the last fifteen years , but there have been in Galicia and in Brittany
There have been accidents in the European Union
I agree with the speaker
As I said earlier , we need to evaluate any important ideas , innovations or legislation in other countries in the light of our own experience
The Member States which you mentioned have every reason to want to protect their coastline
The United Kingdom has an extensive coastline
Greece has an extensive coastline
It would be incon@@ gr@@ uous if a country such as the United Kingdom did not want to protect its coastline
So we are waiting for initiatives from the Commission and we are prepared to shoulder our responsibility in the Council
However , I must reiterate that we cannot assume that our legislation alone is protection enough
Po@@ is@@ oning of stray dogs and cats in Greece
Just a few days before Greece took over the Council Presidency , most recently on 30 December 2002 , large numbers of stray dogs and cats were poisoned in Athens
A similar incident occurred shortly before the start of the last Greek Presidency
These systematic pois@@ on@@ ings give rise to the suspicion that the sight of stray animals is to be er@@ ased from Athens ' image when Greece holds the Council Presidency
Will the Greek Presidency launch an urgent investigation to find out who is responsible for these criminal acts and work towards an immediate solution to the problem ?
As you know , the Council does not have the jurisdiction to answer this question , but allow me as a citizen to condemn this incident
I am sure that I speak for all my compatriots and that the government is determined to deal with any such incident most severely
I admit that is asking a lot of you
Please accept that I love Athens , which I regard as the cradle of our culture and the birth@@ place of everything that we think and feel
But I always sleep very badly in Athens because it simply upsets me so much to hear these stray dogs bar@@ king
I believe that these organisations need money and the support of members of the public
If a particular member of the public also happened to be a minister , that would do no harm at all
A progress report on the application of the plan for the management of the external borders was submitted to the Council on 19 December 2002
The report stated that the Ul@@ ys@@ ses programme would start at the beginning of 2003
The first stage of the operation was implemented in the Mediterranean between the 25 January and 10 February 2003
Spain , which is heading the operation , informed the Council that the second part of the operation would take place in April 2003
However , the Council does not have specific information at this precise moment about the exact date of the operation or its geographical scope
These operational aspects will be decided by the head of the operation and the participating countries
Thank you very much , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , for the information you have just given me
To date , some information on the programme 's efficiency has been published
I thank the honourable Member for his comments , which I shall pass on to the Council
What we are trying to do is to see where we can improve our border protection against illegal immigration
All these are factors which affect the rise and fall in immigration and the choice of crossing point and encourage illegal immigration
I agree that the results of this operation are by no means guaranteed
I do not know if and to what extent the Galileo programme will be used to combat illegal immigration , if I have understood your question correctly
This is a very sensible question and proposal , assuming it is not just a question and I shall make a note of it
I personally think these are worthwhile proposals
The Council has not yet reached a decision on these issues
As I said , they are on the agenda for the summit in Th@@ essalon@@ ika
Until then , immigration and illegal immigration will be the subject of serious debate in the Council
Of course , the initial basic debate on these issues was held in Tampere in Finland and it was this that set the ball rolling in the right direction
A directive was issued recently which is successfully reuniting families
This directive was agreed at the informal meeting of the 15 ministers for justice and home affairs
I therefore welcome the important initiatives taken by the European Parliament
Rest assured that the Greek Presidency will bear these thoughts in mind in discussions over coming months
One of the priorities of the Greek Presidency is the strengthening of relations between the EU and those European countries which are still not on the list of applicant states
This summit will be attended by the Member States of the European Union and the countries of the western Balkans
Naturally our aim is to ensure this process helps countries actually acquire the status of candidates for accession to the European Union
The Council would also remind you that , of these countries , Croatia submitted an accession request on 21 February 2003
This request is , I think , indicative of the region 's interest in moving towards Europe and of the importance which the European Union has acquired
It goes without saying , therefore , that the summit in Th@@ essalon@@ ika will be another milestone in special relations between the European Union and the western Balkans
you yourself say that Croatia has already made an application for accession and that Macedonia has also announced that it will do the same in the autumn
So do you not think that it is urgent that the Union should propose the same to those countries ?
First of all , you said that we should consider registering these countries
The Council has not yet answered this question , so I am unable to give you an answer
But you have raised an important issue which will no doubt engage both the Council and the European Parliament for a long time to come
Mr President , the question of the European Union 's borders is very interesting and has also been discussed by the European Convention
Yesterday the Commission adopted a strategy for a good neighbourly relations policy which also lists those countries covered by the policy
Thank you for your question , because I think this issue needs to be clarified
This conference will be attended by some 40 countries , but not as prospective candidates
That is a separate issue
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , ladies and gentlemen , Croatia 's application for membership represents a further step towards the stabilisation of this region
Just in the last few minutes we have received bad news from Serbia
A state of emergency was declared there a few minutes ago following the assassination of Prime Minister D@@ j@@ ind@@ j@@ ic
If I have understood correctly , you asked if we shall convene an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council in the wake of developments in Serbia
First of all , as I said earlier , we have condemned this incident and expressed our sorrow
We do not think that this incident should cause any internal disruption , over and above sorrow and shock
It is on our agenda and we shall take measures over the next few days if any special support is needed
Questions No 10 and 23 have been withdrawn
As the time allotted to Question Time has elapsed , Questions Nos 11 to 22 and 24 to 49 will be replied to in writing
That concludes Questions to the Council
( The sitting was suspended at 7
and resumed at 9 p
Mr President , we are still eagerly awaiting the arrival of the Commissioner , who has indicated that she would be present for this item
I hope that she will be appearing any moment now
Gender mainstreaming as a political strategy is intended to assist in achieving this ambitious objective
This report accordingly proposes a whole raft of measures intended to underpin the principle of gender mainstreaming in the long term
Strengthening the position of women is therefore a key aspect , but not the only one , the aim being to adopt a double approach
We propose a number of measures in the report
With this in mind , planning and implementation , and also evaluation , need to be oriented towards achieving a defined quality standard and facilitating internal benchmarking
A further package of measures concerning agreement on how to reconcile staff members ' professional and family activities is then needed
One important target is the use of gender-neutral language
The situation as it stands is that although Parliament has always been in the vanguard in this respect , the proportion of women Members was 17
5 % in 1979 , and this has now risen to 31 %
However , in the Convention , there has been a step backwards
I hope there has not been a misunderstanding
We are not expecting a commissioner for this debate
This is very much a debate for the European Parliament rather than the European Commission
We can expect a commissioner later on when we have matters relevant to the Commission 's portfolios
I believe expressions of equality have a profoundly cultural content
The report lists our entire acquis , everything we have applied and adopted in the European Parliament to date , such as the report by Mrs Lalumière
It also includes the European Commission 's good practices in promoting mainstreaming in its staffing policy
This is an own-initiative report which does not impose a policy or commit us to specific measures
I trust you are now convinced that the issue we are debating is important enough to warrant the presence of the competent Commissioner at the debate
The European institutions and how they operate should set the standard and an example for both the Member States and the wider world
Without wishing to underestimate the efforts made , we have to admit that the European Parliament is lagging behind the European Commission
Mrs Gröner 's important report details and sets out all the crucial issues for consideration , proposing specific measures and methods for combating existing weaknesses
I should like first of all to thank Mrs Gröner for the sterling work she has done
As one has come to expect with Mrs Gröner 's work , there was a long and thorough process leading up to this debate
We are able to observe some general warning signs right now
Once , the debate revolved around women 's freely choosing to create equal opportunities
Now , the debate has in actual fact moved on and altered its focus in many places in Europe
The debate has moved back into the home
This , however , is to ignore the facts
5 % of MEPs are women , but they are distributed over a wide area
3 % of Swedish , parliamentarians are women
Matters look quite different as soon as we turn to the indirect and the hierarchical systems
It is extremely difficult to implement what the European Parliament is proposing with gender mainstreaming , which I would translate into French as trans@@ vers@@ al@@ ité
That is what this report is proposing
Europe is once again a pioneer in this area and we should be extremely mindful of this twofold problem
We all see this every day in our respective committees , outside the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities
This report , for which I would again like to thank Mrs Gröner , proposes a two-stage process
I think that this second point is just as fundamental
That is why this report is important both for its pioneering nature and because it highlights the difficulty of this policy
Commissioner , the informal Council meeting last week had already practically ratified some proposals of this report and I am pleased about that
However , I am much less pleased about what is happening with enlargement
It also seems that Poland is looking to retain the prerogatives of its laws on gender rights
I question the political will of our fifteen Member States
This is to not to detract in any way from Mrs Gröner 's efforts in this excellent and very full report
This House would also be run by both sexes in an innovative , progressive way that would result from the differences between the sexes
This is , however , a dream
I find it unacceptable that the Member States introduce equality legislation while the European Parliament fails to do the same
During school holidays or an unforeseen strike at school we see many children running around in this House
They are children of assistants , staff members or of the members themselves
They are not always of an age that they can go to the cr@@ è@@ che , assuming that , as in my dream , there is no waiting list
This would therefore be in keeping with the policy that is aimed at the reconciliation of social , family and working life with one another
Still nothing has changed
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I wish to start by congratulating Mrs Gröner on this work intended to ensure parity
The balanced and active participation of women and men in political life is a crucial instrument for consolidating a more just and democratic society
We therefore need to promote women 's full participation in order to attain a more balanced situation
In the prospect of enlargement and of the 2004 European elections , information campaigns must be undertaken to prepare women who wish to enter the European institutions
This will enable us to prevent the percentage of women Members in the European Parliament slipping even further
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , a few days ago , I think we all supported the international women 's days observed in our respective countries
At European Union level , it has to be said that the principle of gender equality is not yet being applied
Mrs Lalumière 's report , which looks at the situation in our institution , says quite clearly that this is the case and makes specific proposals
It is true that we need to deal firmly with this problem and stop hiding behind socio-economic and socio-cultural considerations
We have said that we want to be a fairer and more equal society
We must take an active and effective approach , whether to structures , information policies , the evaluation of our actions , or the collection of statistics
Might I point out that , in less than a year , the Committee on Women 's Rights will be twenty years old ?
Twenty years is an important milestone , and I hope that we will be able to make a more than positive assessment of all the work that has been done
That is why the gender mainstreaming methodology is important in supporting a kind of gender-based structural transformation that is vital
Sweden is usually singled out as the country with the greatest equality , but the fact is that men and women are not equal in Sweden
No doubt that says a lot about the situation in the rest of the world
Following the most recent election in Sweden in September 2002 , our national parliament consists of 47 % women , that is to say even more than the 44
3 % mentioned by Mrs Dybkjær
In 1998 , I was responsible for gender mainstreaming , which I defended in this Chamber
I cannot see that very much in particular , or even anything at all , has happened in the five years since then
Many have taught themselves to use the term ' gender mainstreaming ' , but just learning to use a new term does not bring about any changes
Rather , we must all learn to put it into practice
We can begin by adopting and implementing Mrs Gröner 's proposal which , in spite of everything , is quite modest and self-@@ explanatory
The basic thought behind this approach , that is that women 's problems are cross-cutting problems , goes back much further however and was applied in policy far earlier
The experience acquired varied somewhat
We can now fill quite a book@@ shelf with the successes and also the problems
Unfortunately we also find misunderstandings on this book@@ shelf and perhaps even wil@@ ful distortions
Some false guides in fact try to sell what is actually specific policy under the guise of gender mainstreaming and that gets us nowhere
Fortunately , in her more than outstanding report , our rapporteur , Mrs Gröner , has erected a dam against such misuse of this term in the European Parliament
The report makes clear once and for all that gender mainstreaming is not a matter of ' add women and stir '
Let us realise that we still have a long way to go before this is really understood
Many men after all find the idea that their picture of reality is not relevant for women unbearable
H@@ id@@ den behind these definitions of reality are positions of power which , as femin@@ ists know , will never be given up without a struggle
We must keep on beating the drum
However , I must stress that acting only at that level would only be scrat@@ ching the surface
There is still a considerable difference between salaries for men and women in companies
Why are they not imposing on all the Member States , including the most backward ones , women 's fundamental right to be in charge of their own bodies ?
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken at noon tomorrow
It was also incorporated into the Regulation for the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period
Equality of opportunities is an objective in all the programmes and actions cofinanced by the Funds
, do not feature equality amongst their objectives
We ask the Commission to adopt more specific and more effective measures to remedy these shortcomings
We also think that there is a clear lack of will in the Member States to promote the objective of equality in the Structural Funds
Particular attention must be paid to women who find it harder to achieve equality of opportunity , such as women with disabilities , immigrants and heads of families
Greater integration of women into decision-making bodies would undoubtedly facilitate this task
Training and awareness-raising in the field of equal opportunities should not only target these women , however , but society as a whole
Let us take the opportunities provided by the Treaty and the Structural Funds Regulation to make progress in equal opportunities with projects that fulfil these objectives
It is true , as several speakers have said , that this objective is not always achieved
The Structural Funds regulation is an important tool , but it needs to be applied correctly in practice
If the parties involved in these four processes fail to demonstrate the awareness and commitment needed in specific polices , there are no results
The Swedish Government recently held a seminar for all its ministers
The ministerial council was given a seminar on mainstreaming , at which planning requirements in all the individual political areas were explained
What we have to realise is that political awareness raising is needed among Structural Fund programmes pl@@ ann@@ ers , be they at ministerial level or at regional or local level
I think that there is a serious political deficit in the evaluations carried out
That is my first point
That brings me to stage two , which is application , and stage three , which is monitoring
The administration - all levels of the administration - play a very important part here , and this refers back to what was said during the debate
This means that the special level of awareness needed to help promote objectives , even at this stage , is lacking at the application and monitoring levels
That brings me to the fourth stage , which is evaluation
This is where firms of consultants come in and external offices carry out evaluations
They are instructed to carry out a separate evaluation of the impact of policies and programmes on women in very few instances
We have initial record@@ s; we do not have statistics because , as you know , most programmes started up in the last 18 months
To be more specific , we need to award extra marks to programmes approved for funding which include the gender dimension
We need special actions to promote these gender equ@@ al@@ ity-@@ related programmes and promotion generally has an exponential effect because it raises awareness among programme pl@@ ann@@ ers
A third important point is the need for more training for senior administrative officials and politicians
My fourth point has to do with preparing the enlargement countries
Mr President , I congratulate Mrs Avilés Perea on this report , which is an extremely timely piece of work of considerable quality
We are forced to admit that much still remains to do in reducing segregation in the labour market and wage inequalities
This is just to mention a few of the shortcomings and to show that the Commission must act to remedy them
Member States clearly cannot remain un@@ involved
A final remark to emphasise that this year the interim evaluation of the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period will take place
The Commission has undertaken to present a mid-term review of the Structural Funds by the end of the year
There are a number of things that need to be improved as regards the allocation of funds
There needs to be balanced participation by men and women in the bodies responsible for decision-making , selection and monitoring at local , regional and national level
Information needs to be provided to applicants and project management staff on how equality of opportunities can be effectively incorporated into draft measures
This would both emphasise and guarantee that equal opportunities are being taken seriously and are really to be implemented in these programmes
The difficulties , resulting from structural weaknesses , involved in reconciling professional and family life still represent a problem
If equal opportunities are not systematically incorporated into all stages of programme planning and implementation , they will continue to be scandalously neglected in the future as well
The Social Fund needs to be used far more intensively as an instrument for remedying the inequ@@ itable treatment of women in the labour market
Women 's demands for equal pay for equal work go back a very long way , but they have still not been met
We need to promote women in the areas of information technology and entrepreneurship
There is also a failure to develop adequate new forms of employment
Although the Member States have formally committed themselves to equal opportunities , implementation of them still falls short in many areas , despite legislation to promote equality of opportunities
what is the point of having excellent legislation if failure to comply with it has virtually no consequences ?
Mr President , I too should like to thank the rapporteur for her brilliant report
In terms of equality policy , we have unfortunately begun far too late to focus upon money rather than upon mere words
When we do indeed focus upon money , we shall be able to attach some real figures to inequality
In this area , the EU 's Structural Funds are its han@@ diest tools for redistributing resources , firstly between the regions and secondly between population groups
The fact that this has not happened is one issue
The Communist regimes considered the oppression of women as something peculiar to capitalist societies , and sexual equality was therefore officially introduced
This meant that women were to go out to work and to take part in political life
In return , nur@@ series were set up , maternity leave was introduced and abortion was legalised in a number of countries
It worked in the sense that the proportion of women in the labour market was high in relation to what it was in the existing EU countries
The EU must therefore make an extra effort to convince women that the EU is something other than a crude market economy
I am , moreover , completely convinced that all of us who are here this evening will happily help her
Mr President , I really want to thank Mrs Avilés Perea for this initiative concerning the use of the Structural Funds
There is no lack of men who maintain that progress is being made but , rather than agree with their view , I just get we@@ ary sometimes
In the fifth century , what was then an eli@@ tist male Church in Europe decreed at one of its Councils that women had souls
In 1993 , the UN conference in Vienna decided that women 's rights are also human rights
In other words , there are more than 1 500 years between these two decisions
Women I meet throughout the Member States are also extremely we@@ ary
They are we@@ ary of participating in projects that do not lead anywhere
I usually urge them to find out what the situation is in terms of options offered by , specifically , the Structural Funds
In her report , Mrs Avilés Perea indicates the difficulties arising from the individual nations ' unwillingness to see an equality dimension in the Structural Funds
Our calls have fallen upon deaf ears
I genuinely hope , therefore , that the Commission and Parliament - and the Swedish Liberals where Sweden is concerned - can cooperate in bringing this about
How , then , is a change in traditional male thinking to be effected in board rooms , for example ?
I said in the previous debate that we needed gender-based structural transformation
It is so rare for us to have debates on equality here in plenary
In this context , I cannot for@@ bear to mention the Convention - one that now wishes to introduce a Christian basis , but no equality between the sexes
That is why I was thinking of the fifth century
Mr President , I should like to congratulate the rapporteur
It stands to reason that women and gender equality are central elements of this
My constituency in Wales includes some of Europe 's poorest communities
Wales is a beneficiary of Objective I funding and has probably had a very similar experience to other areas of Europe
Good work has been done
The European Equality Partnership in Wales has developed systems to try to integrate mainstreaming and fully consider gender and other equality issues in the programming
But people working on the ground still report frustrations
There is a lack of understanding by those running programmes of the economic importance of equal opportunities and the positive effects for the whole community
Good practice is sometimes undermined by the pressure to comply with spending deadlines
Technical assistance is lacking for people trying to implement equality measures
For us in Wales , in particular , there is a worrying under-@@ spend in the gender-specific measures
That is something we need to investigate
All this shows the importance of monitoring systems which will enable us to compare what is really on the ground in different countries
For that to happen , the training and support mechanisms need to be in place to ensure implementation as well as efficient monitoring and sanctions for non-compliance
Invol@@ ving women and equality organisations in the evaluation is extremely important
Much depends on their commitment , hard work and vigilance , which the Member States would do well to try to match
The previous speakers referred to all these shortcomings and the opportunities lost for promoting equality and creating infrastructures which will have a direct and positive impact on women 's lives
It is necessary , therefore , to develop the tools of statistics , the presence of women in decision-making positions and committees , and impact assessment indicators
Tens of billions of euros from the Structural Funds are left over , half of which the national governments should have contributed
While there was an undertaking that 15 % of the Structural Funds would be destined for women 's projects and equal opportunities , the end result is just 6 %
Let us be honest however; we are talking here about 6 % of the money spent and not 6 % of the amount budgeted
In reality therefore it is just a fraction of the original amount
The Commission always takes refuge behind the fact that it does not know which of the proposed programmes are specifically for women and w@@ ashes its hands of it
Having regard to the great surplus we must therefore reverse the roles
This is no longer a true reflection , however , of the situation in the Member States
This is , however , an extremely important weapon in the Commission 's arm@@ oury for ensuring that positive actions to benefit women are implemented
Mr President , it is no easy task to bring about a society characterised by equality
We ourselves present the biggest obstacle
It is because of our attitudes and approaches that we are still a very long way from a genuinely equal society
The lack of equality is of course due not only to our attitudes but also to the influence of the structures on which society is based
We are now discussing one such structure , namely that formed by the European Social Fund and the Structural Funds
Cohesion policy , the European Social Fund and the Structural Funds are very important in terms of developing cooperation within the EU
It is only if everyone feels they are participating that it will be possible for European cooperation to be fully successful
What will of course be crucial to the work on equality in a number of areas is whether these tools promote increased equality or cement existing structures and attitudes
Equality has been a priority objective of the Structural Funds since 1994
The fact that more has not happened in almost ten years is , of course , worthy of note
Progress has been made , but this is insufficient
Employment is of crucial importance to the work on equality
Work opportunities and the ability to be self-supporting will determine whether it will be possible to achieve an equal society
There is also a strong link with education
The work must therefore be designed to ensure that women derive as much benefit as men from what the Structural Funds have to offer
The equality perspective must be incorporated into all the work being done on programmes
It is very important that there should be bodies committed to equality at all levels of society and that these bodies should comprise as many women as men
It is possible to exert strong pressure upon the ways in which the Community funds in question are used
If it is possible for the Structural Funds to be characterised by this attitude , I am sure that matters will look different the next time we debate these issues
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken at noon tomorrow
Mr President , on 27 May 2002 , the Council adopted Regulation 8@@ 8@@ 1/@@ 2002 in the aim of transposing a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions
The European Parliament delivered its opinion on 11 April 2002 , under an emergency procedure , and adopted the Resolution with 14 amendments
Last December , the United Nations Security Council adopted another Resolution , No 14@@ 54 of 2002 , recognising certain exceptions to the obligation to freeze funds and economic assets
On this basis , the European Commission submitted the proposal before us today , which echoes , almost word for word , the United Nations text
as the Parliament European itself called for in the Resolution of 11 April 2002 , to which I have already referred
The reason is nothing less than the persistence of terrorism
Indeed , over the last year and a half in particular , bloody terrorist brutality has shaken the entire world
Focus@@ ing on the fight against terrorism in the European Union , I wish to highlight one aspect that I believe is relevant
The main cause of this is the persistence of terrorism in the European Union
This is not something alien to our borders but something that persists within these very borders
To this end , the competent European authorities have started working on adopting an entire legislative arsenal to combat the terrorist scourge
Mr President , honourable Members , since 1999 the European Union has been applying sanctions against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan
These restrictions were introduced under the common foreign and security policy and in accordance with the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council
Following the terrorist attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001 and the subsequent collapse of the Taliban regime , these measures were reviewed in early 2002
This review led to the lifting of certain restrictions against Afghanistan , such as the flight ban
However , measures against individual members of the former Taliban regime were maintained
At the same time , a great many countries adopted new measures relating to various persons and entities associated with Osama bin Laden and his Al Qaeda network
These measures were taken by the European Union and other members of the international community in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 13@@ 90
These measures are binding on all UN members
The Council of the European Union transposed this list into Community law by means of Regulation 8@@ 8@@ 1/@@ 2002 and authorised the Commission to publish amendments to this list
As you yourself mentioned , Mr Hernández Mollar , it was in April that Parliament adopted its opinion on this regulation
The Council considered this and other demands made in Parliament 's opinion , taking into account the Member States ' obligations under the Charter of the United Nations
It was therefore necessary to raise this point in the Security Council
Consul@@ tations took place with the members of the UN Security Council on the exemptions , which were largely based on humanitarian considerations
During these consultations , some members expressed their concern that exemptions could make the basic arrangements unworkable in practice
This is the background against which the proposal for possible exemptions needs to be viewed
The report shows that the exemptions proposed here sufficiently reflect concerns about the possible impact of measures on the right to life of natural persons affected by sanctions
Resolution 14@@ 52 and the proposal on which Parliament has given its opinion are important means for promoting respect for fundamental rights
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , terrorism constitutes a threat to stability , freedom and democracy
The tragic events of 11 September 2001 and the terrorist attack of 12 October 2002 in Bali are recent , shocking and violent illu@@ strations of this
We have absolutely no doubt that this scourge must be combated , in the aim of protecting our citizens from any threat to their security
Furthermore , our fight for security cannot and must not undermine freedom
We must , therefore , ensure a degree of balance without calling into question the fundamental values accepted by our societies
We cannot allow the principles of law and civic rights to become victims of this combat
I therefore congratulate Mr Hernández Mollar on his report
The legal certainty of the individual must be guaranteed in connection with the fight against terrorism
That is something for which the Member States , including Sweden , and the European Parliament have been working over a long period
Putting people onto terrorism lists in order to prevent terrorist crimes is an administrative procedure
It is a question of implementing international law under the UN Charter
As always in the case of action taken by the authorities , legal certainty at both national and international levels is important to the individual
Moreover , improvements to the UN resolutions are now slowly taking place
One example is that the UN Sanctions Committee must , from this year , justify its decisions , something that is absolutely crucial
Legal uncertainty still exists and , in this area , the committee 's new amendments can play a major role
We propose that the EU introduce provisions concerning processes for deleting persons from lists of those whose funds and economic resources are to be frozen
That is something we propose on the grounds that the process must become still more legally certain
The amendments that the committee is proposing and on which we have to adopt a position tomorrow are constructive , because they require a procedure for de-@@ listing
These amendments must then be carefully considered by the international community , the Commission and the Council
There is no doubt that the proposal contained in the report represents a type of progress
That is in actual fact the principle that generally applies
That is what the amendment by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is , in the first place , designed to remedy and improve
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken at noon tomorrow
The Commission has been unable to comply with European law and deliver its report on the work of OLAF on schedule
Parliament has been waiting for this report
We assumed that as the guardian of the Treaties , the Commission itself could not possibly breach the Treaties - I have in mind Regulation 10@@ 7@@ 3/@@ 99
That is why we are meeting here this evening
I hope that this will not happen again and hope to see the report in the very near future
Now let me turn to a couple of positive points
We were appalled that one Member State should have attempted to block the re@@ appointment of those members for very trivial reasons
I would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency on this achievement , and I specifically wish to thank you , Commissioner , for your support in this area
My second point is that I am very pleased that the Commission is finally intending to take measures against a former Commissioner
In doing so it will be complying with the specific wishes of the European Parliament , in accordance with Article 2@@ 13 of the EC Treaty
Quite apart from the financial scale of the alleged irregularities , it is important for this matter to be progressed if we are to change Europe 's administrative culture
Commissioner , while I am talking about our administrative culture , that of course brings me to the subject of Eurostat
This situation reminds me of a Dutch official we once had here , when exactly the same thing happened
No action was taken , there was not a trace of the zero tolerance policy promised us at the beginning of this period
All I can do is to call on the Commission to mend its ways here as soon as possible
I would like to give you an example of what I consider to be unacceptable
As you know , funds are provided under EU budget heading A-30@@ 35 for maintaining the sites of Nazi concentration camps
We are talking here about one of the foundations for the unification of Europe
All applications need to relate to a project commencing between 1 July 2003 and 1 December 2003 and ending by 30 June 2004
Commissioner , the commemor@@ ative days for the victims of these Nazi camps are held on the anniversary of their liberation
Have your officials still failed to realise that , Commissioner ?
This is a good example of the failure to reform the European Union 's administration
I accordingly call on you to put an end to such nonsense immediately and to finally enact provisions that reflect the breadth and dignity of this programme
Mr President , honourable Members , I have noted your last point once again , and we can talk about that immediately after this debate
It is of course always very difficult to achieve a universally acceptable and uniform basis for the arrangements for the A@@ 30 budget headings
Nevertheless , I am more than willing to have another look at this
The fight against fraud in the Community budget is at the top of the Commission 's agenda in all areas of policy
All the Commission 's services are obliged to act accordingly
The establishment of OLAF , the European Fraud Investig@@ ation Office , has been an enormous step forward at Community level in protecting the Community 's finances
Of the measures for which it provided , 75 % have already been implemented , and I regard that as a good outcome
Mr Bösch 's report relates primarily to the Commission 's report on the fight against fraud in 2001
However , it also covers other OLAF documents , measures and investigations
You are also well known for actually giving your full support to those measures you say you will support
That relates to controls on Community funds
Structural Fund monies and agricultural expenditure are administered by the Member States
That also relates to the reporting of any irregularities uncovered and to the recovery of funds that have not been correctly used or even where fraud is alleged
The Member States are also obliged to recover agricultural subsidies or Structural Fund monies from beneficiaries in the event of irregularities
Mr Bösch 's report quite rightly emphasises the importance of recovering Community funds
In order to make the process more effective , the Commission has redefined responsibilities in its departments
A task force has been set up to deal with costs arising from the past in relation to the EAGGF , and this task force has already started its work
OLAF has continued to develop means of improving its cooperation with the Member States
You mentioned the OLAF progress report drawn up under Article 15 of the OLAF Regulation
It will appear on the Commission 's agenda within the next four weeks and will then be presented to the Supervisory Committee
I am of course pleased that it has finally been possible to find a solution here
All five members of the Supervisory Committee have informed us that they are willing to be appointed for a second period of office
I regard that and the continuity it will provide in consolidating OLAF 's work as being very positive
I would now like to turn to the statistics on cases reported by the Member States of irregularities as regards own resources and EAGGF and Structural Fund monies
The general trend is one of a reduction in the amounts involved in 2001 as compared with the previous year
The Commission is working with Member States through the Advisory Committee for the Coordination of Fraud Prevention , known as C@@ ocol@@ a@@ f , to achieve a uniform reporting system
A working document on this subject was presented to the Committee on Budgetary Control last December
We hope to make significant progress in this field this year
The rapporteur attaches particularly importance to cooperation on fraud prevention with the candidate countries
This organisation also needs to be in a position to work directly with OLAF and I believe that is in accordance with the rapporteur 's proposal regarding branch offices
We are also talking about cooperation with third countries , for instance Switzerland
In this case negotiations on the fraud prevention agreement are still going on
Lastly , I would like to touch upon one final but important point
We have now reached a decisive stage as regards criminal law protection of the financial interests of the Community , by which I mean work in the Convention
This is a key moment
Significant progress towards the creation of a European Public Prosecutor may be achieved , and that is a proposal that has the support of both Parliament and the Commission
I urge the Convention to give its active support to this important idea
We really are at a turning point now
The Commission will also be adopting the follow-up report on its Green Paper next week or by the latest the following week
I also hope that the report by Mrs Theato which was adopted here in the plenary will be given due weight in the Convention 's deliberations
Mr President , Commissioner , I wish to congratulate Mr Bösch on his complete report , which gives a thorough account of the incidences that occurred in 2001
The protection of the Community 's financial interests and the fight against fraud are crucial components in guaranteeing the rights of citizens in the European Union
The Group of the European People 's Party welcomes the almost 40 % reduction in the total annual volume of fraud and irregularities between 2000 and 2001
This fell from EUR 2 0@@ 28 million in 2000 to EUR 1 2@@ 75 million in 2001
Fraud reduction has taken place in all spheres , except in the Structural Funds , where there has been an increase
We are unhappy , however , with the low recovery rate , which has fallen considerably
The Committee on Budgetary Control has on several occasions expressed its unhappiness with the poor functioning of the system and the need for its management to be improved
This can also be a blessing for the law@@ breakers , who see it as a guarantee of almost total secrecy and of impunity
This is a total perversion of justice
I wish to make it clear that Parliament cannot put up with this situation and that we must instigate change immediately
This change involves , first of all , the issue of secrecy
Sec@@ recy must only be invoked when it is crucial to protecting the good name and the reputation of the person accused or to the successful outcome of the investigation
Sec@@ recy should be the exception and not the rule
The public must also receive its information in a different way and not only through leaks
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I too wish to congratulate Mr Bösch on his excellent report
Parliament has proved its worth as a very worthy guardian of the interests of the public and has initiated an administrative reform of which it can be proud
There is no doubt that OLAF could sometimes be more transparent , and I accept the criticisms expressed about that , including those of Mr Casaca
There is also no doubt that the public should sometimes be given information about OLAF at an earlier stage and more openly , as OLAF needs to publicise itself more
Nevertheless , I believe that we as Members should also stress that OLAF is a success story
What would have become of Eurostat without OLAF ?
What would have become of Eurostat without the courageous witnesses who have gone to OLAF and been able to make statements ?
That issue is still being pursued today
I therefore wish to take this opportunity to make a very clear appeal to the Convention to have the courage to take that positive step
I fear that the Member States themselves will not have the courage
Mr President , I feel I must comment on the report by Mr Bösch on the protection of the Communities ' financial interests and the fight against fraud
The report has a coherence of its own , it has some qualities , and a fair evaluation has already been made of it this evening in this debate
This is certainly solid ground that we should occupy , but , I repeat , we must find a balance
In effect , the proposal again creates a European Prosecutor with competence to follow up judgments and crimes that harm the Community 's financial interests
We must therefore continue to enhance the competences of Eurojust , and to strengthen and coordinate these powers at a European level
The amendments tabled are therefore to clarify matter@@ s; all the rest of the report can go ahead
The debate is closed
The vote will be taken at noon tomorrow
( The sitting was closed 11
Mr President , it is a pleasure that this morning this House can have a diversion from the distant dr@@ um@@ be@@ ats of war to the needs of the citizen as consumer
Those needs are addressed in the consumer action plan 2002-2006 and in the Green Paper and its follow-up on consumer protection
I shall be introducing my own report and that of our distinguished colleague Mrs Patrie , who is unable to attend today
A major debate is now under way about consumer policy
My approach to the priorities set out in the action plan has always been to keep it simple and focused
I shall be referring to amendments which have somewhat blurred matters by trying to bring other debates into what should be a clear statement of priorities
I have discouraged amendments which loaded other good causes on to our own report
As the Commissioner well knows , there are other places where these things will be discussed
Indeed , he will be introducing proposals along those lines very shortly and they will be welcome
I cannot accept that we should go further from the area which was laid down in the very extended debates in committee
Some people have queried one or two other amendments , notably the original paragraph 15 , which was an amendment put to the committee by Mrs Thyssen
Some in her party have asked why that should be there
I am sure Mrs Thyssen - if she speaks later - will explain its merits so that her own group can understand it
I shall turn now to the broad principles of the action plan we are deliber@@ ating
They were set out as a threefold proposal
All the reports before you agree on that and on the need to strengthen the legal base in the Treaties for it to be achieved
They also agree that on the important issue of minimum or maximum harmonisation we should be looking sensibly at a case-by-case basis
Secondly , on effective enforcement of consumer protection rules , again we agree - perhaps from slightly different stand@@ points
Only five States out of 15 have met the Barcelona targets for implementation
We need to show the accession states that we can do better than that and help them to do the same
Thirdly , the involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies is crucial for the enlarged Community
We need to know from the Commissioner how the necessary funding will be allocated this year when the existing funds have dried up for the accession states
The point was forcefully made yesterday by a delegation from the European Bureau of Consumers ' Un@@ ions which met with members of the Convention
The next three years will determine whether we can meet the needs of the consumers in an enlarged Europe
It needs the whole force of the Commission and the Member States to bring this about
At the moment only about half our citizens know their rights as consumers
An informed consumer is an empowered citizen
It is our duty and privilege to help to bring that about
I now turn to the report by Mrs Patrie
I am speaking here from her own proposal and notes
The Green Paper states that the fragmentation of rules has prevented the smooth functioning of the internal market
From a consumer standpoint , the obstacles to the development of international trade lie primarily in the lack of certainty surrounding post-@@ contractual relations
The global approach of the Commission is , therefore , to be welcomed
This approach should not result in a lowering of the level of consumer protection achieved under national arrangements
Nor should the adoption of general rules preclude the possibility of specific rules
There is also going to be a need to provide consumers with special protection in certain sectors
In the interests of transparency it should be the duty of the tra@@ der to disclose to the consumer in advance information relating to aspects of goods and services offered
In this area , too , the application of general criteria should not be to the exclusion of the special provisions covering information provided to the consumer
The Commission 's attempt at defining a criterion governing behaviour based on ' consumers of average intelligence ' is not particularly convincing
It is a very imprecise definition and the idea of measuring human intelligence in this way is liable to cause offence
It would be preferable to define types of behaviour that are deemed to be unacceptable and which constitute unfair practices
To this effect , the Commission could draw up a non-exhaustive black list of types of behaviour considered to be unfair
Moreover , we have to protect consumers who are particularly vulnerable
It should be possible to penalise traders who violate their duty of fairness , not least by means of in@@ junctions taken out by consumer organisations
Whatever the benefits of the alternative methods of dispute settlement , the consumer should not be deprived of the possibility of a remedy
The Commission has not yet provided sufficient information for useful comment to be made about the contents of self-regulation and co-regulation procedures
There is an urgent need to establish an organisational framework for cooperation between the national authorities responsible for the application of consumer law
All too often unscrupulous traders are being tempted to exploit shortcomings in the field of European cooperation
I again commend these reports to the House and I apologise for the absence of Mrs Patrie , who was unable to attend because of other business
Although we are not dealing with any legislative proposals on this occasion , the importance of this debate should not be underestimated
It can help us to refute the myth that the internal market is something that is only for business and that the consumer has nothing to gain from it
Good consumer law is an outstanding instrument to bring the European Union closer to its citizens and it is up to all of us to work toward that
Both are objectives of the Treaty and each can support the other
I think this is a matter that we should re-examine in the next legislature
After all , not everything that the consumer keeps on his own home market constitutes a barrier to the internal market that needs to be eliminated
There are still natural limits to market integration - they are summed up in my report - and we must accept them
What it comes down to is identifying genuine barriers and concentrating on them , then we will not miss our target
For the sake of legal certainty we would prefer a general clause based on a prohibition on unfair trading practices
Of course that prohibition must be well defined
To the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market it is simple logic that obligations entered into in codes must be enforceable
We in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market have done our best to concentrate on the legal aspects of this matter
We have made choices based on considered legal grounds
Mr President , let me commence by thanking and complimenting the rapporteurs Mr Whitehead , Mrs Patrie and Mrs Thyssen for their dedicated hard work of such high quality
It has three key objectives
The first is to achieve a high common level of consumer protection
The second objective is to make sure that there is effective enforcement of consumer protection rules
The third objective is to provide for the involvement of consumer organisations in EU policies
They suggested , in particular , the idea of a framework directive on unfair commercial practices
The Commission also suggested the development of a legal instrument for cooperation between enforcement authorities
The favourable response to the consultation exercise encouraged us to continue working on this idea of a framework directive
However there was a general feeling that more information , clarification and consultation on the content of any such framework directive was needed
The follow-up communication of June 2002 responded to this need
We also recognised the need to complete the evidence of existing problems and opportunities
We therefore commissioned three major studies
First , a survey of 16 000 consumers looking at consumer experience of , and attitudes towards , cross-border shopping
Second , a parallel survey asking similar questions to nearly 3 000 businesses , mainly SMEs , that advertise and sell to consumers
This gives us a clear sense of what the impact of a framework directive will be on small and medium-sized companies
Third , we commissioned an independent consultant to carry out an impact assessment of the legislative options set out in the Green Paper
The conclusions of this impact assessment and surveys can be summarised as follows
Eigh@@ ty million Europeans would shop more across borders if they felt as secure as they do when shopping at home
For@@ ty-six percent of companies expect the proportion of their cross-border sales to increase with harmonisation
Only 1 % of companies expects a decrease
Six@@ ty-@@ eight percent of European businesses said that harmonisation in this area is an efficient way of facilitating cross-border sales
The impact assessment concluded that a framework directive based on full harmonisation would be the most effective way to remove barriers to cross-border retail trade
In addition , my services have been working on the nature of the legal barriers faced by business and consumers
First , we have been working with a group of national governmental experts to examine and compare national laws on unfair commercial practices
Second , we set up a team of academics who are currently completing a comprehensive comparative legal study
And third , we have organised a two-@@ day workshop on several key issues , with all stakeholders
I hope it has also enabled us to build a broad consensus on a workable framework directive
The view of the European Parliament plays a very important part in the Commission 's deliberations
I hope today 's debate will enable us to reconcile the remaining points of divergence between the two reports
I look forward to hearing your views in this debate
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the Commission communication and Mr Whitehead 's report on the Consumer Policy Strategy 2002-2006 are quite crucial documents
In our homelands , the standard of consumer protection is an important yardstick for measuring the effectiveness of our work
Various committees have delivered their opinions
The Committee on Budgets had the task of examining and evaluating the financial statement for this Consumer Policy Strategy
Whilst it adopted the Commission communication , it proposed to the lead committee a number of regulatory adjustments
I therefore hope that time can still be found to make the necessary adjustments or to allow the proposed amendments to influence practical implementation
The importance of consumer protection as a subject is not a matter of dispute
What we have to do is get to grips with how we put it into practice
I will appeal to the Commission 's rigour in saying that I am , though , firmly convinced that consumer protection does not run counter to these criteria
On the one hand , for example , we are pursuing the objective of a reduction in bureaucracy in Europe
I get the impression , though , that we are creating ever more bureaucracy , thus taking ourselves that extra bit further away from the goal of reducing it
I would also like to take this debate as an occasion to address the image that we have of consumers and the public
Mr President , actually I can be brief here and thank Mr Whitehead
I can only express my thanks for that
The Committee on the Environment , Public Health and Consumer Policy added Article 153 to this and as far as I am concerned that can stay
I do not think there can be many problems with that , Mr Whitehead
I suspect that is a translation problem rather than something about which there can be a great deal of discussion
I hope this clarifies things somewhat and I am eager to give half a minute back to the President to make up for speaking a bit too long just now
Mr President , it gives me pleasure to begin with the strategy for consumer policy and to respond to what Mr Whitehead has written
What the Committee on Women 's Rights and Equal Opportunities wants is for vulnerable groups to be closely involved in consumer policy and I think this is expressed very well
This means that we need to equip the consumer to make considered choices
The consumer organisations in the applicant countries are not yet , if I may put it like this , ideally equipped for their role as representatives of consumers
The need to pay special attention to this is justified and we have asked for this very often
Mr President , now I come to the Green Paper
The aim of the Green Paper is to arrive at a framework directive for consumer policy
I am , if a number of conditions are met , for such a framework directive
Pres@@ ent legislation is indeed too fragmented and a framework directive can help to bring clarity to the situation
Un@@ fair trading practices must be the starting point for this and so I feel very comfortable with Mrs Thyssen 's report
The legislation of this framework directive must not and cannot come on top of the existing forest of regulations
That would make everything even more confusing , not only for the consumer but certainly also for the business world
In that sense we think that the framework directive would solve something
That makes things clear and provides more opportunities , especially for smaller businesses , to make use of the opportunities offered by the internal market
I think this is necessary , because if this does not happen confusion will remain
In that sense we can vote for a framework directive
I think this will help us to reach a very good demarcation
I wish the services of the Commission a lot of luck and ask them to please involve us , and the stakeholders , in drafting the new legislation
Mr President , I am delighted that this morning we are debating three strong reports on consumer protection and that they stra@@ d@@ dle so many different committees
Consumer policy issues should not just be the prerogative of one particular committee , they should be fundamental to all our work
The comments I shall make will in essence be confined to the Whitehead report , although they will clearly have implications for some of the other reports too
Adam Smith declared that the sole end and purpose of all economic activity is consumption
The consumer is king and we in Parliament - and indeed in the Commission - would do well to remember this
The Commission report ' Consumer policy strategy 2002-2006 ' , and indeed the Whitehead report , are both extremely positive steps in this direction
This point has already been picked up by Mrs Thyssen and Mr Radwan from two other committees
I totally agree this should be done on a case-by-case basis , a point he explicitly am@@ pli@@ fies in paragraph 13 about the principles of subsidiarity , necessity and proportionality
I hope the Commission takes these points on board
I particularly admire the way the report is not just filled with good intentions
It calls for sensible , practical and concrete steps to be taken to create better consumer protection throughout the European Union
It is a basic consumer right that consumers should be able to breathe fresh air
I hope that he personally , along with the Quaestors , will play his role in ensuring this
Finally , I expect the Whitehead report to carry overwhelming support in the vote this morning
Such a verdict would indeed be well-@@ deserved
I hope that it will also be embraced with equal fer@@ v@@ our by the Commission and the full Council
The consumer must reign everywhere
Long live the king
Consumers , it has just been said , are one of the reasons for the existence of the European Union
Better and cheaper products and more choice are the main@@ springs of the internal market
Consumers have not been given full recognition for this before now
So I also warmly applaud a general initiative and framework directive for consumer policy
There are four points I would like to emphasise
Information about rights and supplementary codes of conduct is needed
Information about products and production methods is crucial
Of course , not every consumer will walk into the manufacturer 's premises to ask about production methods
Research shows that only 10 % of consumers are interested , but that 10 % set the trend , certainly when they are supported by strong consumer organisations
Point three , give consumers a voice , support consumer organisations , especially in applicant countries , and search for new ways to make consumers less anonymous
Experi@@ ment with public forums too where consumers can contribute ideas about the development of new production techniques and production methods
A strong consumer policy must , of course , contribute to the development of a situation in which consumers are the touchstone for European policy , from chemicals to e-commerce
A great deal is done in the name of the consumer in Europe
Liberalisation of public services is supposed to offer consumers cheaper and better services
S@@ plen@@ did of course , but what has it achieved ?
Throughout Europe passengers are complaining about the deteriorating quality of public transport
Prices on the telephone market have become obscure and confused and few consumers in the end are queuing up to choose between electricity suppliers
What exactly has ten years of the internal market delivered for the consumer ?
Or take the euro , another example
The euro was supposed to make everything cheaper
Meanwhile we know that the euro has caused significant price increases
Of course , things can go against us
Every consumer understands that
But if liberalisation , the euro and the internal market do not have the desired effect , what can consumers turn to then ?
Can consumers turn to European politics , their national governments , business and industry ?
Consumers must have rights , but they must also be able to get political redress
In short , we must stop making vague promises about and to consumers
Objectives for consumers must be concrete and clear and it must be clear who bears the political responsibility
Mr President , we are dealing here with three important reports of course
It is true that it is not legislation , but I look forward with interest to the legislation that will follow these reports
I do that with a great deal of confidence , because on this point too we have every confidence in this Commissioner
I am curious as to whether he can indicate how long it will be before we can expect the various proposals for this legislation
The challenge , of course , is to properly coordinate consumer policy and the completion of the internal market
Consumer policy must not be allowed to be an excuse for erecting trade barriers
I also think that the figures that the Commissioner gave just now on the benefits that we all gain from harmonisation speak volumes as far as that is concerned
Consumers benefit from free trade because they can buy cheaper and better products and of course we must achieve a high level of consumer protection
Confidence is the engine of economic growth
Consumers must have confidence in products or they will not buy them
Industry must have confidence in the internal market and consumers must have confidence in suppliers
We can kill two birds with one stone
We must work towards a situation where it no longer matters to consumers whether they buy their products in the Netherlands or Greece
Consumers often do not know what their rights are
Consumer organisations can help with this
Consumer magazines are widely read and contain useful tips
People have a lot of confidence in these organisations
So I think and I am glad that the Commissioner is also working for this that the Union must involve these organisations closely in the preparatory work for future policy
Besides , unfair trading practices damage confidence in the market
A dishonest car sal@@ es@@ man can spoil the market for his competitors
D@@ ish@@ on@@ est traders must therefore be tackled forcefully , which is why it is good that the choice has been made to adopt a European approach to tackling undesirable commercial practices
Of course we need to be clear about what constitutes undesirable trading practices
For me that is not only taking advantage of physical or mental vulnerability or the use of physical or moral pressure , obstructive behaviour must also be included
For example , making it difficult for consumers to change their service provider
Only when you can switch easily from one service provider to another , do you have optimum competition resulting in lower prices and better quality
Just think about changing your bank
You cannot take your account number with you and I think these are artificial barriers
Finally , Mr President , I think that the Commission should use Article 153 of the Treaty more often as the legal basis for consumer protection
We did not create this Article for nothing and it will benefit both the consumer and the internal market
Lastly , I would like to stress the need for the To@@ ys Directive and control of the CE mark
I have also written to the Commission several times on this matter , but I regret to say that I have not received a satisfactory response
Incidentally , at this stage of the debate on consumer protection and policy , I would also like to express very clearly two concerns in the form of basic criticisms
These policies are only rarely objectives in themselves and tend , for the most part , to be a result of free competition
Mr President , the Green Paper presented by the Commission and the reports presented this morning are along the right lines
We should indeed establish all the elements that guarantee consumers a high level of protection without delay
They must feel sure that their rights are fully and equally respected everywhere
In order to achieve this high level of protection , it is therefore vital to involve representative consumer organisations in drawing up both Community and international policies
As a number of significant changes are currently taking place in terms of trade , it is essential to consult our citizens
They must be able to take part in debates and influence decisions that primarily concern them
Consumers must play an active part through their consumption , which should no longer be uninformed
Instead , consumers should be able to make informed choices
Community-level lo@@ gos relating to fair trade or to companies that observe a social charter , are therefore valuable , effective instruments , as are those representing organic farming
In this context , traceability of GMOs seems , once again , to be one of the most basic factors
In particular , we must not , as implied by some amendments , allow consumer confidence in GMOs to increase
We should also emphasise the need for citizen participation in establishing a sustainable model of society
We must not reduce the citizens to mere consumers
Quite the opposite , citizens must play a full part in identifying their needs , so that society itself chooses to develop in a way that can respond to them
We believe that there is no cause for objection where preparations primarily intended for healthcare applications are used in other fields
A recent example is that of cosmetics and deter@@ gents
That does not mean we do not value - for we greatly appreciate it - the major work carried out by consumer protection organisations
Once this has been determined , the other is the correct transposal and practical enforcement of Community law by the Member States
A high level does not necessarily imply uniform protection
We believe it is essential to observe the principles of subsidiarity , necessity and proportionality
I personally am in favour of minimal harmonisation , leaving each Member State free to establish the legislation best suited to its way of doing things
I also support the idea of systematically using Article 151 of the Treaty , which should become the sole legal basis for legislating
We must stop systematically using Article 95 , which only concerns the single market
Guaran@@ te@@ eing all citizens universal , affordable access to high-quality services is one of our main requirements
We must demand that the WTO does not dismantle our public services
Similarly , I agree with WTO labelling as an instrument for providing information on origin and production methods
asking the Commission for an impact assessment on the possibility of maximum harmonisation seems unrealistic
Similarly , a link should be established between consumer protection and regulation of sales promotion
As for establishing codes of conduct , the idea as its currently stands does not seem to me to be an option we should pursue
What would be the basis for the legitimacy of these codes of conduct ?
How could we ensure their durability ?
All these questions are an indication that this would be the wrong course of action
The Consumer Credit Directive is one example of this
With that in mind , we should be supporting all measures that have the effect of promoting sales and the fulfilment of the internal market
Under no circumstances must businesses be tangled up in more red tape , as it is above all small and medium-sized enterprises that are handicapped by it
We must make it our objective to create more confidence while , at the same time , avoiding increased bureaucracy
This is a matter of showing respect for the Bureau and for his fellow Members , which I believe should take precedence over any request to speak
Mr President , at this moment all over the Basque country demonstrations are being held -
Mr Gorostiaga , this is supposed to be point of order concerning the order of business
The Bureau will not allow any type of speech other than a point of order
Mr President , I believe that , today , we should welcome this debate on the Green Paper and the strategy proposed to us by the Commission on consumer policy
We are also aware of the role that consum@@ er@@ ism plays in the economy , and heaven knows we need it at the moment
Studies have shown , however , that , outside the border areas , European consumers do not know how to make use of the advantages provided by the European Union
In order to remedy this , we therefore need to harmonise legislation and establish genuine European consumers ' rights while guaranteeing the flexibility required for application in the Member States
We are therefore in favour of better information for consumers
This should be clear and written in the consumers ' mother tongue so that they can make fully informed choices
We therefore agree on a high level of consumer protection and on transparency achieved through associations and we expect a great deal from the Commission
We can guarantee , Commissioner , that we shall be looking over your shoulder to ensure that this consumer policy is followed through
Mr President , in today 's world it is clear that consumers are more informed and more demanding
They have higher expectations and are not always after the cheapest price
They want quality and after-sales service and they want to be clear about their rights and remedies for redress
In an ideal world , responsible businesses would respond to consumer needs
Some would say that the vast majority do , and if that were the case , then we would not need to legislate
But we need to protect the consumer from the cowboy operators , those who engage in sharp practice , and the ri@@ p-@@ off merchants
The legislators ' dilemma is to produce good effective law which protects the consumer , while allowing business to thrive in a dynamic and competitive environment
We need simple , better-@@ focused legislation which is easier to enforce
As you know , Commissioner , the concept of fairness differs between Member States , depending on their different legal systems
In those countries which operate a general clause , we also know that operates differently
This presents you with the challenge of finding a common approach
I know that , as a skilled lawyer , you are committed to ensuring legal certainty for both business and consumers
The consumer is already faced with fragmented regulations and enforcement
Businesses need to be clear about the standards and practices they must aspire to in order to be able to deliver on this directive
I personally favour cr@@ acking down on misleading and deceptive practices rather than attempting to achieve a common definition of fair commercial practice
In the Thyssen report Parliament has made it clear that it wants to see an extended impact study in this area
Commissioner , you have mentioned three studies and you have been very clear about the benefits of this directive
You have been less clear about the potential cost of this directive to business
It is important that we explain to business what its obligations are and what it has to do to achieve your consumer protection objectives
Mr President , I wish to address my remarks to Mrs Thyssen 's report , which I welcome , and I congratulate her on such a balanced piece of work
We know well the dilemma in dealing with a report that has to stra@@ d@@ dle the interests of business and consumers
However , to achieve all of that we have to build confidence in our consumers
The one area that concerns me is in paragraph 17 of the report , which I endorse completely
It concerns this linkage between codes of conduct , legal certainty and enforcement and how we get those three to really work together to protect consumers
I shall try to illustrate that with an example
Yesterday I received a letter from a constituent who had bought a property in another Member State
money had been wrongly deducted from money he had handed over
He applied to the appropriate overarching professional body
He wrote in his own language , English
He received a reply in their language that stated that they were unable to deal with his complaint unless he wrote to them in their language
If we really want to do business across Europe together we have to be fair and reasonable with one another
Co@@ des of conduct have to be properly enforced
In its legislative acts , Parliament has the duty of taking the complexities and future effects of consumer protection into account , as well as the risks associated with it
The reports on the future of European consumer protection policy meet this demand whilst also demanding that an end be put to the lack of discipline in relations with consumers
Many people see the provisions in the areas of food safety , services , health and safety as having already lost their moral innocence in the face of market developments
Consumer protection has to protect people against fraud , health hazards , and financial loss
I see the subject of transparency as having had far too small a part to play in this morning 's debate as a whole
If , for example , there are problems , there should be real disclosure enabling all to see which businesses are causing them
We must also use this to introduce incentives to get entrepreneurs to really plan for safety
We need all these things
Parliament 's resolution contains many lines of approach for the introduction of precisely this consumer information directive
It is not enough simply to call for greater freedom of choice or more informa@@ tion; on that I agree with all those who have already criticised that idea
I would then like to urge you , as a matter of urgency , to enact the To@@ ys Directive a good deal sooner
Let nobody try to tell me that that is obvious
Mr President , in studying the three reports on consumer protection I asked myself whether this is not more about promoting consum@@ er@@ ism
The internal market is already a corollary of the comm@@ and@@ ment `` th@@ ou sh@@ al@@ t consume ''
Evidently we now need to add the comm@@ and@@ ment `` th@@ ou sh@@ al@@ t consume throughout Europe ''
Mr President , you will understand that I am rather critical of this
We cannot deny that language , distance and cultural differences are the most significant barriers for consumers
This is completely ignored when we look for the cause in un@@ familiarity with regulations in other EU countries
What is more , this assumes that the consumer is familiar with the regulations in his or her own Member State
If we want to invest in consumer confidence we must above all invest in the reliability of products and services
I take the view that well-informed consumers can make their own choices
There needs to be a balance between protecting the consumer and the consumer 's own responsibility
I do not think we need a uniform legal framework
Let us first begin with minimum standards in the cases where there are real problems
It is artificial to generate legislation based on Article 153 , because this has only been applied as a legal basis in practice on one occasion
I do not have any anxiety about discriminating against Treaty articles because we make less use of them than other Treaty articles
In this regard I would put forward a number of proposals which I feel to be urgently necessary for a genuine policy protecting the wide range of consumer interests
The European Union must adopt the necessary measures to achieve the participation of consumers in the management of this activity , if it wants to achieve genuine economic democracy
In addition , I do not feel that the proposals for protecting young people , in particular , from the serious dangers of smoking are adequate or sufficient
If consumer policy is to be genuinely implemented , consumers must be accorded the same importance as an identical guarantee covering the whole of the Union 's territory
The principle of minimum harmonisation of consumer protection policy is enshrined in the Treaty , moreover
It is now important that there is a more effective , comprehensive policy to win support for minimum harmonisation across the board
To this end , we need new rules which are endorsed and , above all , which superse@@ de the previous rules
Mr President , I want to thank all three rapporteurs
For that reason I myself wish to focus on those principles that I think should be incorporated into EU legislation on consumer protection
The main principle , one which has been raised here very often , is that levels of consumer protection must be as high as possible
I do not agree with harmonisation , however , if it means even one Member State having to for@@ sake higher levels of consumer protection
For this reason I am pleased with the view expressed by Mr Whitehead in his report , that each act should be examined on a case-by-case basis
This same principle must also apply to mutual recognition
Account here must also be taken of the notion that not one Member State , neither a current nor a future one , should down@@ grade its standards of consumer protection
Future legislation must also be sufficiently clear and must take the principles of subsidiarity , necessity and proportionality into consideration
We are all agreed that the prerequisite of a free and fair market is that consumers have access to helpful and correct information
That is relatively simple to provide for when it comes to the ' old ' consumer requirements in terms of the link between price and quality
It is also all right when it is a case of declarations of content , washing labels and so on
The modern consumer is , however , a different type of citizen
That also applies of course at the time of purchase
This means that today 's consumers demand many different types of information
When they go shopping , they want answers to questions concerning ethical , ecological and social matters
In addition , there is now a host of different health claims of varying significance
I believe that this is the only way of coping with this new type of labelling
The general rule is , do as you like but on no account lie
Mr President , I welcome the in-depth work carried out by Mr Whitehead , Mrs Patrie and Mrs Thyssen concerning the implications of the Green Paper on consumer protection
In this regard , they will become one of the main , essential players in this development , which we would like to be long term
Mr President , I would like to refer to the Green Paper , specifically that on consumer protection
I believe that there are already adequate rules on the essential parts of what the Green Paper covers
I therefore have in mind only the directives on misleading and comparative advertising or the fact that all the Member States have laws on du@@ ress and the use of force
I therefore see no need for a framework directive in this area
Unlike some of those who have spoken before me , I do not expect an additional framework directive to achieve that
I want to put the case for a framework directive with a comprehensive clause founded on the principles of sound business practice
More and more frequently , the internal market ends up being handicapped as a result of the lack of regulations or the leeway left by the directives
There are also those who call themselves campaigners for consumers ' rights who allow themselves to be engaged in this cause and help to drive competitors from the market
That is why I believe it necessary to make greater use of the legal form of a Regulation in order to achieve greater legal certainty
That will also lead to harmonisation , and that is what we need in the internal market
The Commission has drawn up a comprehensive list and appended it as an annex
All the points in it are important , but the new priorities in the Whitehead Report introduce a succession of others , ranging from important to less important
What Mr Whitehead has said today has actually contradic@@ ted this order of priorities
Consumers can avail themselves of their rights only when they know what those are
Work on consumer protection should make information policy a priority
Consumers ' associations have an important part to play in this , and governments must support them in it
The Commission deserves our congratulations on its detailed research , as of course do our rapporteurs on their proposed amendments
However , the path is not stre@@ w@@ n with roses
The obstacles and technical difficulties are mani@@ fold
For example , the Green Paper proposals also need to address the proposed regulation on sales promotions
This approach does in fact reduce the need for detailed regulation , allowing a rapid response to be made to the increasing number of unfair practices and devices
Even legislators in central Europe , which are well accustomed to detailed regulation , are relying increasingly on general clauses in order to adapt legislation to changing circumstances
This approach has proven to be valuable and has allowed legislation to be updated
We shall be unable to avoid specific regulation in the end , but it should play a complementary role
Another problem is choosing between maximum harmonisation and minimum harmonisation
I think that we should proceed on the basis of maximum harmonisation and should only take selective recourse to minimum harmonisation in individual instances
I should like to close with a couple of words about the special attention which needs to be paid to consumer organisations
We need to ensure they are representative and transparent because consumer organisations are currently a consumer protection problem in themselves
Mr President , Commissioner , I am very glad that I have managed to get a few of my amendments accepted
I hope that the Commissioner is also satisfied
Commissioner , I believe that to be of the utmost important particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises
I am particularly happy to have been able to get two amendments that I regard as being quite crucial made to the Whitehead Report
One aims to guarantee optimum health and safety provisions in the current evaluation of chemical substances whilst ensuring the use of in-@@ vitro testing procedures whenever possible
This is just a fundamental principle , but its emb@@ odi@@ ment in law will be a major step forward
They get better eggs , which taste better
Knowing as I do that you , Commissioner , are a particularly kin@@ d-@@ hearted man , I am sure that you too will be very gratified by these amendments
We have seen how the discussion so far has demonstrated our unanimity as regards the objective of achieving a uniformly high standard of consumer protection
Consumer policy is about informing consumers , giving them freedom of choice as well as protecting them
It has also already become harder to reach unanimity on the subject of what minimum or maximum regulation should be like
I would like to conclude by saying that I attach great importance to item 18 in the Whitehead Report , namely access to affordable and high-quality services of general interest
Mr , President , first of all I want to pay tribute to our three rapporteurs
Parliament is very fortunate in having distinguished Members who are experts in their field and that is reflected in the quality of the work they presented to us
I want to speak from the perspective of the rapporteur on internal market strategy for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market
I was very pleased that colleagues endorsed this report so soundly in the last plenary session
We all share the view that confident , well-informed consumers , empowered to make choices , are at the foundation of a successful internal market
We also want to encourage responsible and successful businesses to adopt regulation to help themselves , to look at codes of conduct , to drive out irresponsible businesses
That is the framework in which we must all judge your proposals
Enforcement of regulation must be something that you will look at
I am pleased that you explained to us the range of studies that you have commissioned , including impact assessment
I want your assurance today that the impact assessment is looking at the costs imposed on business and making sure the results are proportionate and delivering real consumer benefit
In conclusion , I would like to say on behalf of all my colleagues in the Internal Market Committee , that we are really interested in consumer policy
I say to you in generous terms , please get out more , come and spend more time with us and together let us build a real consumer-@@ driven internal market
This success is also the result of these rules being commun@@ itar@@ ised
The fact that the largest mobile phone companies are European should not prevent us from doing so
Not only I , but also my staff and collabor@@ ators who have worked so hard on this proposal , take satisfaction from that
I will start with the points relating to the framework directive and then I will address some points on the action plan
A number of Members mentioned full harmonisation
As you know the Commission is determined to complete the internal market , and making the single market work for business and producers is just one side of the story
Internal market rules should also promote the confidence of consumers to buy goods and services without being put off by national borders that may lie between buyer and seller
I reject the idea that you can have one without the other
The Treaty requirements on consumer protection and the internal market are entirely compatible
The history of EU consumer protection is largely one of minimum harmonisation that leaves the Member States free to go beyond the basic level of harmonisation if they so wish
This has led to legal fragmentation
It has also created obstacles to the smooth functioning of the internal market
Recent surveys reveal that only 13 % of EU consumers made a cross-border purchase in the last 12 months
We need , therefore , to strive for simpler and more common rules and practices to promote consumer confidence in cross-border transactions
The importance of this is further heightened by enlargement
If neglected , fragmentation of consumer protection rules would significantly increase
We have , more specifically , to overcome the real barriers arising from national laws and national case law on unfair commercial practices
For example , take the benchmark consumer - against whom misleading advertising is assessed
This , according to the ECJ case law - for instance the Clin@@ ique case - is the average consumer , reasonably well informed and circum@@ spec@@ t
But this test is not applied consistently across the EU
In the S@@ can@@ ner advertising case , the German highest court ruled that the benchmark consumer is the casu@@ al observer instead of the reasonably circum@@ spec@@ t consumer
Therefore it is our intention to provide for full harmonisation of rules on unfair commercial practices and codification of the average consumer test , thus removing significant barriers
I turn , briefly , to mutual recognition
The framework directive will provide full harmonisation of the laws on unfair commercial practices
This convergence and the effective level of consumer protection achieved should set the political conditions to make the principles of mutual recognition and country of origin acceptable
The overall level of protection will be increased within the EU since a number of Member States do not at present have a comprehensive regulation on unfair commercial practices
Naturally , we recognise that the framework directive must deliver an effective high level of consumer protection
This does not mean the lowest common denominator of existing national regimes
Nor does it mean a comp@@ ilation of all the stringent existing national provisions
A number of Members raised the issue of simplification
The Commission will try to incorporate as much as possible of the acquis in a framework directive
Those elements of the acquis that were included in a framework directive would be repealed
Of course , this will not include contract law provisions , which will be addressed in the context of the action plan recently adopted by the Commission
These matters , which are currently subject to minimum harmonisation rules , will be fully harmonised by the framework directive
In addition , the general clause in the directive will replace all the divergent general clauses in the Member States and so create a more uniform regulatory environment
I know people are calling for it
It is an important aspect of this proposal and will make it generally more acceptable to business and consumers alike
On the question of ' fair and unfair ' , the framework directive would h@@ inge on a general clause prohibiting unfair commercial practices
This was one of the main issues for consultation
The definition of what constitutes an unfair commercial practice should lead to more legal certainty
Businesses trading fairly will not have to change the way they do business
To help achieve this legal certainty , a non-exhaustive list of unfairness categories and a list of examples of banned commercial practices will supplement the general clause
A number of Members mentioned codes of conduct
Different positions have emerged in the light of the EU consultation on the idea of endorsement of codes at EU level
Some have argued in favour , others have argued against
Mrs Patrie 's and Mrs Thyssen 's reports reflect these differing positions
I want to encourage responsible businesses to treat their customers fairly and recognise that voluntary codes of conduct may play a key role towards this aim in their particular sectors
Any endorsement process should be voluntary
A code owner would choose whether to apply for endorsement , and a firm would , therefore , choose whether or not to join this code
On the question of vulnerable consumers , this is an issue of some complexity
There are a number of different aspects
We will make our minds up before we draft the legislation which I hope will be brought forward in the very near future
I turn to Mr Whitehead 's question on funding
I want to stress that it is as important to improve the quality of expenditure as its quantity
This is an issue we are also taking into account
Finally , I thank Members again for their constructive comments and the rapporteurs for their reports
The debate is closed
The vote will take place today at noon
Mr President , there is something I would like to have done in this House
I noticed today that there are bann@@ ers hanging in the Parliament 's cour@@ tyard
I do not want to discuss what is on these bann@@ ers , but it has no place in this honourable House
I therefore ask that these bann@@ ers be removed
I have taken note of this and I shall inform the competent services
I hope the Commissioner will reconsider this and find some space in his obviously very hec@@ tic di@@ ary
Mr Evans , I think you would find it difficult to cite the rule that allows you to raise a point of order such as this
I hope , nevertheless , that this has enabled the rest of the Members to return to their places , because I have a statement to make
I would like to read to you a message from Mr Cox , President of the European Parliament , following the assassination of Mr Zor@@ an D@@ z@@ ind@@ zic
' I was shocked to hear of the assassination of the Serbian Prime Minister , Mr Zor@@ an D@@ z@@ ind@@ zic , and I strongly condemn this act
I hope that its perpetrators will swiftly be brought to justice
Zor@@ an D@@ z@@ ind@@ zic , in many respects , symbolised the new democratic State that Serbia has become
On behalf of the European Parliament , I would send my sincere condolences to Mr Zor@@ an D@@ z@@ ind@@ zic 's family and friends , and to the Serbian people '
Ladies and gentlemen , I propose that we hold a minute 's silence
Mr President , I wish to point out one remarkable characteristic of the vote that is currently in progress
With effect from 1 April the European Union will be taking over from NATO responsibility for peacekeeping in Macedonia
This will be the first military operation to be conducted under European Union leadership
Mr von Wogau , that was not a point of order
Are any Members opposed to the application of this oral amendment presented by our rapporteur ?
This is a pos@@ th@@ um@@ ous glori@@ fication of the communist ideology which is not to my taste
I tried to amend the text with a more subtle wording
I did not succeed in committee and the amendments were rejected in plenary
I regret this and I wanted to specify here my position in this regard
The Treaty of Amsterdam and the regulations relating to the Structural Funds also make mention of this
The rapporteur is asking for support for better child care , care for the elderly , better organisation of working hours and a different division of tasks within families
I support this proposal because everything it contains is fair and well-intentioned
However , I do not think it will do much to solve the present problems
The role of the Structural Funds is going to diminish for the current EU Member States or even disappear altogether , in favour of projects for the newcomers
It will be good if feminist criteria are taken seriously into account from the beginning for these new projects
Instead of providing full-time , stable employment , it proposes to extend part-time employment and anti-@@ educational , quic@@ k-@@ fix specialisation programmes , turning women into cheap , flexible labour
Proposals include further cuts to the state family benefit system and using private-sector programmes and structures to cover social services such as health , education and welfare
We are in favour of positive arrangements for working women , provided they are free of charge
We are not in favour of promoting flexible working hours on the pretext of reconciling working and family life
We are in favour of full-time , stable employment and of extending and strengthening employment and social rights
Parliament must , therefore , be able to translate and represent various points of view
In this context , however , I think it is appropriate and crucial to protect and also deal appropriately with the high value of domestic and intra-@@ family work
Unless we do so , we will be prolong@@ ing and deepening inequality
The Structural Funds must contribute , even in the countries of the European Union , to combating existing gender inequalities in development policy
The reform proposed by the ECB , under its technical exter@@ ior , is therefore far from harmless
That is why we are asking for more than just a hurried debate
We have chosen to vote against the report on reforming the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks
We have also voted against the ECB 's proposal
We believe there should be no hurry in tabling a proposal on how the ECB work might be reformed
Not until 2007 at the earliest will EMU be enlarged by more than 15 members
There is therefore no reason to put a move on and table a proposal at this early stage
We think it is better to analyse this issue in greater depth and to give the new Member States opportunities to express their opinions on the matter
In any future proposal , it will be important to emphasise the need for improved transparency within the ECB
Transparency is an aspect that , unfortunately , is conspicuous by its absence in the proposals presented
Hence our appeal to the Portuguese Government not to accept this position and to take account of the European Parliament Resolution rejecting the ECB 's recommendation
Neither the European Central Bank 's proposal to reform the voting methods within the Governing Council nor the model proposed by the Friedrich report are satisfactory
The ECB 's proposal would , in fact , allow the larger Member States to dictate monetary policy
The model proposed by the Friedrich report allows one vote per member within the Governing Council , thereby giving the impression that it respects equality between the Member States
In fact , this is not the case since it will be the Executive Board of nine members that will take most decisions
Amendments Nos 3 and 4 , tabled by Mr Huhne , certainly represent a significant improvement
I nevertheless believe that the IGC must agree on a proposal that reflects a better balance between fairness and effectiveness
Each central bank takes important decisions on interest rates and exchange rates , with major consequences for incomes , employment , investments and the level of public services
It is precisely because of the importance of these decisions that banks that issue bank notes were brought under state control in the past
This meant that important considerations could be taken out of the hands of the banks and were made the responsibility of governments and parliaments
The European Central Bank is in danger of being cut increasingly loose from the Member States
Public control over the ECB should be increased rather than reduced
It is , therefore , understandable that the ECB should have proposed an amendment to its Statute that stream@@ lines its decision-making process
I do feel , however , that the solution that has been reached - that of rotating voting rights in line with each State 's GDP - is not acceptable
First of all , because it elimin@@ ates the principle currently in force , which is ' one State , one vote '
Secondly , because it makes it more difficult for the public to understand how the EU 's monetary policy is defined
Each member of the Governing Council always has the right to vo@@ te@@ ;
Proposals that achieve a simple majority of votes of the national govern@@ ors are adopted , provided that this majority represents at least 62 % of the population
Reform of the ECB 's voting system must only be implemented , however , at the next Intergovernmental Conference , which is scheduled for 2004
Like the United Nations , the ECB would now have an Executive Board consisting of 5 Member States with permanent voting rights
The ECB must be a strong body , with greater autonomy from the governments of the EU 's Member States
This is not about the amount of power Portugal will lose but a fundamental issue of the type of European construction that we wish to achieve
Nor can I recommend the Council 's proposal that the eurozone countries be divided into three groups under a rotation system
In both these cases , the principle of ' one member , one vote ' would be abandoned
That is something I cannot on any account support
Instead , there is every reason to defend this principle , which is based upon equality between the Member States and upon everyone 's joint accountability
The pretext of combating terrorism is now in place and a vast and complex mechanism to limit freedoms continues to be developed and established
People and organisations have been put on lists and suddenly forbidden to travel abroad
It has also been made impossible for these same people and organisations to receive or spend money through bank payments
Once they are on a list , no matter how much of a mistake that may be , it is extremely difficult to get off again
Generally it is not the real terrorists who are affected by this , as they have developed illegal routes that cannot be touched by it
They are refugees and democratic oppositions in exile , who are h@@ ated by the regime in power in their country of origin
What is now being proposed is moving in the right direction
This is an attempt to pursue an illegal and illegitimate NATO operation which is consistent with the interference and imperialist aggression inflicted on the Balkans
It is therefore an initial military operation that will open the way to others , with the ' replacement ' of NATO forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina being suggested as the next
Or they involve taking sides and giving support to one warring party based on the major power 's own interests or ideologies
That is what people call ' peace-@@ enforcing ' , the imposition of peace
Peace that is not supported by the parties involved will lead to a resumption of conflict after the withdrawal of the new occupiers
We do support ' peace keeping ' , helping to maintain peace at the request of both parties in a conflict
This is geared to keeping the warring parties apart and avoiding new disasters
This is why we support this kind of military presence in Cyprus , Kosovo and Macedonia
If the UN does not bear the direct responsibility for this , then better the EU than NATO with its bias toward American war policy
That is why I am voting against the majority of the GUE/NGL Group and for the EU taking over peace-keeping responsibilities in the north-west of the Republic of Macedonia
I sometimes have the feeling that we are our own worst enemies
The concern that this issue has raised is justified
It is right that the procedures followed have been improved , as a result of being harmonised with the general legislative requirements for data protection
Consequently , since these amendments have been approved , I felt bound to vote against the final report
Do we really need an own-initiative report to say that Parliament agrees with the provisions of Article 13 of the Treaty prohibiting all forms of discrimination ?
Our society cannot at present do without measures aimed at promoting more equal opportunities for women
This is where the European institutions , the European Parliament in particular , can play a role as a pioneer in the world of work as a whole
Equal treatment for men and women is incorporated in the Treaty establishing the European Communities and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights
Here , gender mainstreaming is appropriate long-term for integrating gender issues into political and administrative decision-making processes and ensuring equal treatment in all policy areas and at every level
Speaking as a woman , though , I wish to be judged by my achievements rather than by my gender
The concept of ' positive discrimination ' is an inherent contradiction , as discrimination cannot be a positive thing
We should therefore be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath@@ water
We would like to protest against this conce@@ al@@ ment
It is therefore possible that this scandal might become more serious and add to the charges of the Bösch report
We can be just as effective using other means , such as Eurojust , which would have the merit of not creating a chain of institutional problems
The reality is that , in comparison to previous years , this is the second highest level that figures for suspected fraud have reached
These results , which emerge from the report , give cause for concern
Although there have been improvements in the combating of fraud , it seems utterly impossible to get misuse or the irregular use of EU funds under control
I repeat my long-standing criticism that the structures mean that abuses are inherent in the system
I appeal to the Member States to make greater efforts in this area in order to put an end to these abuses
Cooperation with other Member States , as well as closer checks at home , is absolutely vital , and not just in view of the imminent enlargement
Even if there were no EU , agreements would have to be made between different countries on common support for these rights
As always , in the end it comes down , however , to the content of the agreements and not the fact that everything is subject to the same regulations
You can level everything down by regulating as little as possible , scrapping existing national regulations and leaving as much as possible to voluntary cooperation of the companies involved
I support the warning against this of the Consumer Association in the Netherlands
It has to be about combating unfair trading practices
Co@@ des of conduct cannot substitute for legislation but are no more than detailed supplements
It has to be possible to enforce compliance with the supplements by all concerned
Fortunately the proposals of the rapporteurs , Mrs Thyssen , Mrs Patrie and Mr Whitehead are moving in more or less that direction
I voted wrongly on the conclusion to section 23
The Whitehead report constitutes a crucial initiative in the European strategy for consumer protection policy
In this context of promoting high-quality tourism , the report calls above all for a high common level of consumer protection and for more effective compliance with existing rules
Although these priorities are important , taken on their own , they are relatively unambitious
I also welcome the initiatives on informing consumers about their rights
Currently , only a meagre 52 % of consumers feel that they are well informed
To this end , I support greater participation of consumer 's organisations in developing awareness-raising and information campaigns
' an informed consumer is an empowered consumer '
The existence of an internal market and within this , various transnational business operators , requires the creation of appropriate mechanisms for protection and transparency
This model , however - it must be stressed - will still have to take due account of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality
I share the idea that Community consumer protection rules have failed to adapt to a rapidly changing market
This is why , in stimulating a debate on possibilities for improving the operation of the internal market , the Green Paper is extremely opportune
I also agree with the attention the Green Paper pays to the new relationships between undertakings and consumers , particularly in the context of electronic commerce
Turkey is a candidate for accession to the European Union , in which it is not acceptable for political parties to be banned in this day and age
Mr President , I ask you to intervene in this matter
I do indeed have great sympathy with your criticism , and this is something I do not understand either
It will be noted in the Minutes
Thank God we do not have to discuss Turkey 's accession today
I believe that item 8 of the Portugu@@ ese-@@ language version is wrong and item 8 of the versions in French , Spanish , English , etc
I would therefore ask the Bureau to ensure that this item is corrected and to inform the plenary that this is done before the vote takes place
Thank you for pointing that out
We will ask our language service to take up this issue
The next item is the Commission statement on the closure of undertakings after receiving EU financial aid
Commissioner Fischler has the floor
Mr President , honourable Members , newspaper headlines feature - with increasing frequency - the closure of undertakings to which financial aid had been granted by the European Union
Whilst this is not a new problem , it is true that the instances of closures , often followed by relocations , have recently been increasing in number
My fellow Commissioners , Mrs Diamantopoulou and Mr Barnier , have asked me to put before you the Commission 's position on this complex problem
Secondly , it is in the context of enlargement that the Commission gives this problem particular attention
In an internal market such as our own , the decision as to where to base a business operation rests solely with the management of the enterprise in question
The subsidies granted to the investors are freely negotiated with the public authorities , within the limits of Community and domestic legislation on state aid
This is an area in which the Commission can ensure only the implementation of the general provisions on the Structural Funds laid down by the Council with Parliament 's agreement
I might add that this corresponds to the practice within the Member States , in which every region endeavours to attract new enterprises and direct investment
All these provisions will have to be applied in the future Member States from the moment of their accession
I would like to observe , in order to give the full picture , that the five-year rule I have just mentioned applies only to the 2000-2006 programming period
Let me also briefly enlarge upon the social dimension of the problem of the closure of undertakings
The Commission 's position is clear; enterprises may well be free to come to their own economic decisions , but they must always be aware of the social dimension
If job losses appear to be inevitable , everything possible must be done to make the workers affected by them more employ@@ able
If this is to be done , the enterprises must have thought out a forward-looking policy and must also demonstrate social responsibility
Several Community directives lay down the framework within which such a dialogue must take place
The European Works Councils Directive , in particular , imposes on multinational groups of companies with bases in Europe precise duties as regards informing and consulting workers ' representatives
Social measures accompanying restructuring are , after all , also an important issue for the social partners and for the new European Observatory on Industrial Change
In this area , too , the Commission relies on the Member States , upon whom devol@@ ves the duty of ensuring compliance with Community labour law
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate Commissioner Fischler on the communication that he has just given this Parliament , but I cannot
Today , at best , we will be attempting to limit the damage caused by the abuse of Community aid granted to multinational companies
Jo@@ b losses deal a devastating blow to the workers affected and their families
Two years previously , acting in a similar way , they had shut down their factory at Ar@@ ou@@ ca in the same region , leaving almost 500 people unemployed
Clar@@ k had benefited from enormous sums of Community , national and local aid
I have just quoted verbatim from the press release issued by Clar@@ k on 10 January
The other case is as follows
By pure chance , one of them realised what was going on and alerted her colleagues
All the workers maintained a vi@@ gi@@ l at the factory gates , day and night , in the rain and cold , until the courts ordered the seizure of the equipment
Both companies intend to relocate to enlargement countries and to third countries
If this situation continues , what will become of the European social model ?
Subsidies that are granted must serve to create employment and not to fund relocations
The European Union 's priority is employment
The Lisbon strategy set the objective of achieving full employment within the decade
This Parliament is increasingly apprehensive about the progress that has been made in the European Union with regard to the Lisbon ambition
This phenomenon of factory re@@ locating is spreading in several Member States , creating unemployment and endangering the economic and social development of the regions
We therefore call on the Commission to draw up a legislative framework that will attach a moral component to granting companies Community funds
Clear rules must be established , which prevent and punish abuses by companies that receive subsidies from the European Union
As an immediate measure , we urge the Commission to monitor closures currently underway and to draw up a list of companies that fail to comply
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if I may , I shall ful@@ min@@ ate and also express a demand and a regret
Such action also en@@ no@@ bles and dign@@ i@@ fies the European Parliament
And on that note , Mr President , I shall obey your ga@@ vel
the first is to say that Commissioner Fischler has not disappointed me because I no longer have any illusions about his actions
I congratulate her on this , however , although I feel bound to note the contradiction
In the majority of cases , these companies relocate in the sole aim of maximising their profits , since their productivity , efficiency or economic viability are not at stake
This situation is particularly serious in countries that are weaker in economic and social terms
The case of Portugal cannot be compared with that of other countries , although this entire issue warrants attention throughout the EU
To sum up , this is a very long list , which needs to be closely examined
Measures must therefore be adopted to regulate this type of investment and to protect employment and local and regional development
Nor must aid be granted to companies that , having received aid in one Member State , transfer their operations to another without having fully met their commitments
Otherwise the aid they have received in the first country must be repaid
Consequently , the Commission must make a rigorous assessment of all recent and current cases
Mr President , Commissioner , I hope it is not because we are discussing industrial desertification that Mr Fischler is here
I also think that we cannot constantly leave globalisation on the sidelines because , ultimately , this debate concerns the socio-economic development of the Community as a whole
It raises the issue of European policy , the legal framework adopted in response to the ground@@ swell of globalisation and un@@ principled , uncontrolled liberalism
The Union is still the most significant interlocutor and player we have to respond to these global phenomena
Me@@ tal@@ working and textiles are not the only industries affected by industrial desertification
The ter@@ ti@@ ary sector , businesses with a high added value such as Da@@ e@@ wo@@ o and Phili@@ ps , are also affected
Da@@ e@@ wo@@ o is now quite simply and unab@@ as@@ he@@ dly abandoning its workforce without any kind of restriction
We must put an end to the poor practice of the past , and that is what you are failing to do , Commissioner
Let us now force businesses that have failed to fulfil detailed commitments to reimburse their subsidies
That will be the price paid by Europe , but if Europe is to have a future , it will be at that price
The side issue in this case is the petty qui@@ bbling of the national opposition
Even today the case has still not fully come to light or been brought to justice
These are longstanding problems , to which solutions will one day have to be found
We know that companies ' motives for closing and then re@@ locating are many and various
We are also aware , however , of the damaging effects of relocations , especially when they take jobs away from regions that have no alternatives
The decision to close is , therefore , a cruel one in social terms and is dictated purely by external economic reasons
We therefore wish to express our solidarity with workers who are directly or indirectly affected
We ask the Commission to look into the support mechanisms , at both national and Community level , from which the companies in question have benefited and which it distribu@@ tes
We must all know what is happening in this area and that public opinion can also exert control and impose its own sanctions
Through dubious and , in some cases , illegal state aid , tax revenue has been used to move jobs around within the European Union
They do not , however , have to repay more than the amount of the aid plus interest
The punishment is therefore mild in relation to what has happened
The idea of the internal market is damaged through the distortion of competition that occurs when certain companies and certain forms of production are given unwarranted support
Small loc@@ alities in Sweden have so far been the losers in the dishonest job trading conducted in Europe
For B@@ eng@@ ts@@ for@@ s and the province of Dal@@ s@@ land in western Sweden , for example , the effects have been disastrous
The Member States must abide not only by the letter of the EC Treaty , but also by its spirit
Naturally , cases such as B@@ eng@@ ts@@ for@@ s lead to people 's confidence in the EU 's internal market being undermined
I want now specifically to address two questions to Commissioner Fischler
In such cases , no new jobs are created
Instead , a social mechanism for providing security is swept away
My second question to Commissioner Fischler relates to the answer previously given by the Commission to a question concerning the transfer of jobs in B@@ eng@@ ts@@ for@@ s in Dal@@ s@@ land to Portugal
Nothing , not even the current climate of economic stagnation in Europe , justifies the illegal and immoral behaviour in Portugal of some companies backed by foreign capital
The ongoing contempt for the interests of regional communities , for individuals and for the European Union itself is , therefore , completely unacceptable
This is why a special role has been given to the European Monitoring Centre for Industrial Change , which can assist in defining alternative policies for cases of relocation
I personally am against the use of public funds to increase private profits
Public money , whether it belongs to the Member States or to the European institutions , should be reserved for public services
The real problem , however , is not even that
The problem lies in the current exponential increase in mass redundancies
It is unacceptable for an employer or board of execu@@ tives to be able to decide to make workers redundant simply to increase company profits
It is unacceptable for lives to be destroyed and regions ruined in order to pay higher dividends to shareholders
what use are the European institutions if they are powerless in the face of this fundamental problem ?
Mr President , it is very interesting that our Portuguese colleagues have brought this to our attention and we have had many contributions from them
I want to approach this from a very different perspective
I must emphasise that I do not defend manag@@ ements that behave irresponsibly or take state aids and then do not deliver the jobs
The Portuguese authorities had plenty of ways of doing that
I say to almost all colleagues that have spoken in this debate that they are walking away from the problem
We have not heard the word ' market ' from anyone
I remind you that we work in a market place
Companies have to produce goods that customers can afford to buy , at a profit , otherwise they cannot continue to employ people
We are now living in a global market where companies have to be competitive
The closures I have seen are because the company wants to survive in business , to continue employing people in high-quality jobs
They are the same quality , but I can buy this fully finished product for the price I paid for the raw material in the United Kingdom
That is the reality
Industri@@ es that are facing that sort of competition have to look at the ways they can restructure , invest , change the process , introduce research and development
Mr San@@ tos was the first person to mention that
We have funds from the sixth framework programme
We have research funds to put into industries for the complete re@@ design and re@@ config@@ uration of processes
Industri@@ es and vulnerable sectors have to start working much better together
I was amazed to see the reference to producing at a lower cost in my resolution had been taken out
Produc@@ ing goods at a lower cost is crucial
I come from a region where we have a traditional industry , the cer@@ am@@ ics industry , that is facing this kind of pressure
That industry is starting to re@@ config@@ ure and to work together with support from the British Government , using European funds , to tackle these issues
I went to see a company the other day that makes cer@@ am@@ ics in competition with lower cost Portuguese producers
That company has invested EUR 55 million to re@@ config@@ ure its process
It has had to lose jobs as a result , but it has worked with its trade union to do that
That is the sort of fundamental change we want
That is what the Commission has to encourage
We do not want to have any more tedious debates in this House about state intervention , about criticising manag@@ ements
If we walk away from the issue and do not make European industry competitive we will continue to have this sort of problem
Mr President , Commissioner , during the last Strasbourg part-session , the me@@ tal@@ workers came to demonstrate their dismay at the restructuring of Ar@@ cel@@ or
They left Parliament in dis@@ belief , disgu@@ sted at not having been heard , and some said that they would come back , but only to cause damage
The doc@@ kers were here this week , and they almost did destroy everything
If Europe continues to ignore the social impact of the liberalisation policies it is implementing , there will be further explosions
Of course , Europe is not responsible for uncontrolled restructuring , but , at the very least , we could try to regulate it
For now , however , there is total refusal to do so
The Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs , Mrs Diamantopoulou , has already stated that there will not be a directive on the matter
Nor will there be a European code of good conduct for companies
But when there is nothing , and no political outlet for despair , violence becomes the last resort
These calculations are based on share price and anticipate the very short-term profits to be gained from a mass reduction in personnel costs
Ultimately , even where expensive social plans are implemented , the calculations are viable and there is a return on investment within two years on average
They also ignore extern@@ alised costs such as public aid and unemployment benefit
You might ask what Europe 's role is in this internal schem@@ ing within the Member States
Perhaps none , except that the vast market and the rules on free competition that it supports create areas where , apparently , anything goes
The Portuguese example of de@@ loc@@ alising businesses is just a drop in the ocean , but it is representative
We can also accept most of the points made and endorse those contained in the motion for a resolution
I believe that to be something that we must not permit
The consequence is that evidence indicating the importance of our having a working market economy is very important and must not be allowed to be disregarded
The second is to ask what we can do to ensure that aid is not misused , but applied to the purpose for which it was granted
Such a possibility does not at present exist in the Treaty
The third thing I would like to address is the issue of whether new firms are given preferential treatment
For a start , it does not make much sense in this context to insist that a firm be newly established
What is much more interesting is to focus consideration on how many new jobs will result from a project being supported
That is the decisive factor
What this is about is increasing the level of employment in these regions
You have made a number of suggestions with the future in mind , and to these I want to say one thing
We can see difficulties in this as regards data protection
That is a fact , and we have to live with it
It is therefore appropriate the proposals should be made as to how the rules on the grant of structural funding might be improved
I have received five motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 37 of the Rules of Procedure
The next item is the debates on cases of the violation of human rights , democracy and the rule of law
Mr President , I welcome this resolution which highlights the declining political situation in Cambodia
The situation must be rectified before the country holds its general elections in July
Although we as democrats welcome these elections , they will be meaningless if political activists continue to be intimidated and harassed
The reports that the voter registration process is unfair and undemocratic are of grave concern and must be followed up by real action
In our resolution we urge the Cambodian authorities to allow for free and fair elections , allow freedom of expression , freedom of the media and religious freedom and more
But in reality we have to work harder to exert pressure on the authorities to make these changes
Currently freedom of expression is being trampled by the Cambodian authorities
The outbreak of violence which occurred in Ph@@ no@@ m Pen@@ h is a reaction to a T@@ hai ac@@ tress 's comments that An@@ g@@ k@@ or W@@ at should be returned to Thailand
Furthermore , Cambodia 's only independent radio station was closed with the charge of inciting riots
The Cambodian Government reacted to the anti-@@ T@@ hai feeling amongst its population by expe@@ lling hundreds of T@@ ha@@ is from the country
Such abuses of freedom and clear displays of xenophobia must be stopped now
Whereas democracy def@@ uses wars , the juxta@@ position of despotic regimes here represents a dangerous threat to this entire Asian sub-@@ region
State violence and all kinds of persecution have recently led to the assassination of Mr O@@ m Rad@@ sad@@ y , presidential advis@@ er to the national assembly , in the street
Europe must use the many channels available in order to stabilise this country , and the entire region as well , especially at election time
Let us not forget that Cambodia is the main recipient of aid in this region
Both the situation inside Cambodia and the situation regarding its relations with its neighbours demand our attention today
On@@ -@@ going tensions with Thailand and an atmosphere of political intimidation are character@@ ising the run-up to the general elections of 27 July
The draft resolution before us is therefore opportune
Still the Christian churches are worried as conflicts between Budd@@ his@@ ts and Christians are on the increase
The resolution rightly asks the Cambodian Government to withdraw these guidelines
I sincerely hope that the Council and the Commission will actively support this appeal
The resolution contains another appeal to the Cambodian authorities that also meets with my complete approval
They must take all necessary measures to curb the abuse of children
Sadly trafficking in women and children is in any case an increasing problem in Cambodia
In@@ siders stress that the national government could do more about this
less aid if they fail to address this
Especially at this time of transatlantic drifting apart , Brussels must form a united front with Washington on this
We did this in close collaboration with S@@ on San , a grand old man of Cambodian democracy , who was a frequent visitor to this House
What makes matters even worse is that repression from the centre outw@@ ards , that is , on the part of the government , is currently on the increase
I would like to remind you that of all the countries that the European Union gives financial support to , Cambodia receives the most support per head of population
However , I am very concerned about the human rights situation in Cambodia
We all know that practices such as torture of prisoners , the involvement of the army and police in trafficking of women and children and excessive pre-@@ trial detention are commonplace
Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would first like to thank the Commission
Two weeks ago , I went to Ph@@ no@@ m Pen@@ h
I think or , at least , I hope , that these events will subsequently have given the EU representatives in Ph@@ no@@ m Pen@@ h pause for thought
I believe we should also question all the cooperation projects we manage and the financial sum they represent
The situation remains extremely worrying
I believe that our resolution is sound , and I would thank the authors for that
I feel that the threat to cancel the cooperation agreement , because that is precisely what we are talking about , is extremely important
It is a signal that can be heard by the authorities in Ph@@ no@@ m Pen@@ h to encourage them to continue with the electoral process until July
The Commission has made proposals to appoint the head of this electoral observation mission
This person must not be merely a witness to the vote count at election time
The most crucial game is now being played over access to the media , 95 % of which are controlled by the authorities in Ph@@ no@@ m Pen@@ h
This electoral mission will therefore have to wrest@@ le with the authorities in Ph@@ no@@ m Pen@@ h
I call upon the competent persons in Parliament to ensure that a strong@@ -@@ will@@ ed person is appointed and sent to Ph@@ no@@ m Pen@@ h as soon as possible
The Commission very much hopes that the political climate will not deteriorate still further at a time when preparations are being made for Cambodia 's forthcoming parliamentary elections
I am able to assure you that the Commission , in close consultation with the EU 's Member States , is following further developments in Cambodia with close attention
The Commission is , moreover , concerned about the situation of the media in Cambodia
Free expression of opinion in the press is , admittedly , permitted , but the publicly owned media continue to be under government control to an immense degree
A preparatory mission , led by the Commission and consisting of experts on elections and representatives of the Member States , was in Cambodia from 27 January to 4 February
The Commission notes with satisfaction that Parliament has supported this decision
I will turn now to the problem with the civil disabilities imposed on Christian associations
Per@@ mission for such activities in public can , however , be obtained from the Ministry for Education and Religious Affairs
These provisions apply not only to Christians , but also to all religious bodies , and were introduced to reduce the risk of conflicts and clashes motivated by religion
The debate is closed
The vote will take place after the debates
It has been noted that , although no longer under house arrest , Aung San Suu Kyi is being subjected to pressure , threats and intimidation
It has been noted that the systematic use of torture , extrajudicial executions and forced labour is widespread in Burma
Thus , the requests are quite clear and direct
This is the very clear appeal that Parliament is making
We expect a response from the Commission
It is a pity that we cannot have a response from the Council , but the request is contained in the resolution
What fears it should inspire in the military junta currently in power , if this resolution determines the EU 's policy with regard to Burma
The political and moral responsibility of the EU is now involved
Perhaps it should be involved to the point of criminal prosecution
Surely European businesses are cynically exploiting the workforce in this prison@@ -@@ State , which has become a general labour camp , where the concept of citizenship no longer applies ?
This country is certainly far from the European continent and European legislation
We need to activate the European Union 's economic and industrial lever in order to prohibit any investment by the Member States in undemocratic regimes
We need to ensure that the industrial policy of the Member States is a moral one
The time for theoretical statements has passed
This resolution is very strongly worded and comprehensive
Each paragraph should be part of a framework for a genuine Community policy on the military junta , and therefore to the benefit of Burmese civil society
Mr President , we are often placed in a dilemma when dealing with evil and repugnant regimes
Some will call for dialogue , wanting to point out their concerns and encourage the regime to change its ways
Others - the re@@ alists - want tough action and opt for isolation of the regime and sanctions
Every situation is distinct and calls for different measures
It can be said with some confidence that tyran@@ ts rarely listen to reason and only respond when their vital interests - often personal - are seriously under threat
The European Union and the wider international community can be powerful bodies when they act with unity , consistency and determination
When they are divided or make seemingly empty threats , sending different messages through other channels , then the ty@@ rant sees no need to respond
We are seeing this with Iraq
Saddam clearly feels - wrongly - that he is being let off the hook
Sometimes tough measures are introduced but there is little resolve in implementing them or there are deliberate efforts to undermine them
We have been at this for years
Parliament has been adopting resolutions and the Council common positions since 1996
Where is the application and the resolve to achieve some real results ?
Current sanctions against the Burmese regime are due to expire on 29 April
The sanctions should be rigorously enforced
In addition , I call upon the Commission and the Council to assess why the action so far has been ineffective and make recommendations to remedy the situation
In reality , however , Burma still continues to be afflicted by the repression of ethnic minorities , rape and violence against women
The elimination of political dissidents and summary executions have not stopped
Torture , detention and forced labour are common practice
Despite the government 's deni@@ als , I believe that children are still forced to join the army and also , I regret to say , the rebel military forces
Consider , for example , the tragic child-@@ soldier system
recent Amnesty International surveys have shown that approximately 90 % of the population of the State of S@@ han are subject to forced labour
either forced labour or prison
Their work , for which they are not paid , consists of building military infrastructure , roads , buildings and military camps and even performing military duties
They work without a break from morning until night , with no food except a small quantity of to@@ asted rice
Despite the fact that the Burmese penal code has banned forced labour , the situation has not changed
It has not changed despite the presence of the International Labour Organisation
Wor@@ st of all is the continued abuse of power by the Burmese army , the military intelligence services , the police and other security forces
The Burmese generals continue to wage war against their own population
They take no notice of the rest of the world
Everything that God has forbidden goes on in Burma
In drawing up a new common position , the European Union must speak with a clear voice
The time is long overdue for the generals to release unconditionally the 1 200 political prisoners who are being held in atrocious conditions and tortured
The Council and the Commission must also give very serious consideration to the systematic rape of women and sexual en@@ sla@@ vement and argue for an international investigation into this
The ILO must be given access to all areas where forced labour is going on
The European Commission must denounce these abuses at the WTO
Finally , Mr President , it is of the utmost importance that the Burmese refugees in Bangladesh are not forcefully repatriated
The European Union must strengthen the sanctions against Burma
A ban on foreign investments should be introduced
European companies which get Burmese blood on their hands to serve their shareholders must be pilloried
Unfortunately there are still Member States that give more weight to their own business interests than they do to a consistent human rights policy
Only with broad international support do the oppressed Burmese people have a chance of ou@@ sting the generals
As Members of this House will be aware , the Common Position has been reinforced a number of times since 1996
It has also been stipulated that , in the future too , the Council will respond appropriately to favourable as well as to adverse developments in Burma
Its explicit statement on the situation in Burma led to the adoption by the International Labour Conference of a resolution on Burma , which is now being implemented
The Commission has no reservations about favouring closer cooperation between the WTO and the ILO and welcomes the informal cooperation that already takes place to some degree
The Commission also favours independent international investigation of the charges laid against the armed forces , namely of sexual violence and other infringements of the civilian population 's rights
The debate is closed
The vote will take place after the debates
And yet , Commissioner , ours was a voice crying in the wil@@ der@@ ness
Under Islamic law , she is guilty of treason
How can this happen in the 21st century and be ignored by the powers that be on the planet ?
What a pity the Commissioner is not listening
What has the political leadership of the European Union done , what have the Commission and the Council done ?
What sanctions have we imposed on Nigeria , a country with which we have economic and commercial ties ?
What purpose do clauses about respecting women 's human rights in the Cotonou Agreement serve , Commissioner , if there are no sanctions ?
Finally , does Nigeria have a secular , democratic regime or a the@@ ocracy ?
Does the country have a government or is it ruled by mul@@ lahs ?
Mr Karamanou , I do not know whether Commissioner Fischler understands Greek too
I am asking this because I can see that he is not wearing his ear@@ phones
My intervention took the form a series of questions to the European leadership , which has done absolutely nothing to stop the crimes being committed against women in Nigeria
in the final analysis , what is Nigeria ?
Because on 25 March , Amina Lawal 's case will be heard before the Sharia court of appeal
We are out of our minds with worry
We have no idea what is happening in Nigeria
Three years ago , we were celebrating the return of democracy to Nigeria and a democratically elected government
And yet this government is completely incapable of imposing the constitution and the law on the country
The mul@@ lahs rule the country and are sentencing women to death by stoning for allegedly engaging in sex outside marriage
We want the Commission and the Council to intervene at once
The leadership must take a stand against these issues
That is what we are asking of you , Commissioner
Thanks to the international campaign , we were able to help Saf@@ ya Ho@@ es@@ se@@ ini escape the stoning to which she was convicted even though she had been raped
So you still have a little time , Commissioner
She was convicted in K@@ at@@ s@@ ina , one of the twelve northern regions where Sharia has come into force during the past 3 years
The death penalty , mutilation of women and flo@@ gging and the prevailing discrimination that accompanies these things have become common practices
This immediately renders the Constitution of Nigeria , the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and all other treaties that Nigeria has ratified dead letters
Presidential elections are being held in Nigeria in a couple of weeks
Ri@@ oting associated with the introduction of Sharia has already claimed a couple of thousand victims
Recently 220 people were killed in riots surrounding a beauty contest
The atmosphere is defined by economic crisis , unemployment , lack of security and widespread corruption
There is , alas , a huge danger of civil war in this enormous and densely populated African country
And here we are voting on another resolution
Commissioner , we did that on 15 February 2001 , 15 November 2001 , 11 April 2002 , September 2002 and the ACP did that on 21 March 2001
Mr President , I read about this case last year and did the only thing that I could do
I raised it in my group
We discussed it in the group and with other groups in this Parliament and passed a motion for a resolution on the plight of Amina Lawal
The motion clearly sets out what we believe the government of Nigeria must do , in accordance with its international obligations and the requirements of its own federal constitution
It must use its legitimate power to protect Amina Lawal and other Nigerian women in similar situations from this cruel , degrading and inhumane treatment under Sharia law
When we have completed the process of enlargement , we will be economically and politically more powerful
We must remember this and similar cases and the plight of all women under Sharia law in the African continent
We are not trying to impose our will on any sovereign state , but we will tell them that there is a price to pay
Africa needs our help and we will give it generously , but Africa must reciproc@@ ate by treating its citizens humanely
Nonetheless , religious practices , cultures and traditions can be changed
Today , we women are still the victims of discrimination in Europe , our sexuality is commo@@ di@@ tised , but our right to exist has been won
However , the suffering and injustice suffered by women and people all over the world seem to scourge our bodies and rend our souls now as never before
The Federal Republic of Nigeria has ratified the international human rights conventions
they must be observed and enforced in practice
Nigeria has even adopted a Constitution which guarantees the right to freedom without torture or punishment
Yet how many other women and how many men are lying in prison or are charged and han@@ ged ?
I genuinely believe that it is extremely important for there not to be double standards
Mr President , in September last year Parliament adopted a resolution condemning the sentencing to death of Ms Amina Lawal
Since then there has been strong international pressure from all sides to help Ms Lawal , and rightly so
a mother facing the death penalty
The Lawal case been seen as a test case in and outside Nigeria
Nigeria has no state religion and that is how it should remain
Car@@ rying out this death sentence would be a signal that different laws apply to Muslims in Nigeria than to Christians and that cannot be allowed
The impression must also not be allowed to be created that violation of human rights and the death penalty are acceptable
The Nigerian Government must ensure that they comply with international obligations in the area of human rights
In less than two weeks Ms Lawal 's appeal against her inhuman punishment comes up
Hopefully she will win that appeal , but if not , I would like to remind President Ol@@ use@@ gun Obasanjo of his own words
keep your word
The Nigerian Government has sufficient means to prevent this case from ending in tragedy
We wait to see how the Nigerian Government will act after the appeal on 25 March
I express the hope now that the Lawal case will not bring dark clouds over relations between the Union and Nigeria
Finally , Mr President , President Obasanjo was grateful to receive the Freedom Prize of the Liberal International a few years ago before he became president of that country
Madam President , Amina Lawal , an illiterate 3@@ 1@@ -year old Nigerian woman , is preparing to face death for the crime of adultery
She claims she was raped by a friend and subsequently she bore a child
Sharia has recently been introduced in parts of Nigeria as part of a process of Islam@@ ic@@ isation
The sentence has been delayed until 2004 to allow her to we@@ an her child
Even in Iran , there has been no stoning for almost two years now , with the most senior judge recently declaring the punishment illegal
This is not about the death penalty per se , which remains legal in international law for the most serious crimes
It is about a disproportionate and grat@@ u@@ it@@ ously cruel punishment against a young mother
It is not a feminist issue either
In none of these cases have any of the men involved in the adultery been punished
Nigeria has one of the highest rates of illiteracy in the world
Madam President , the stoning of women must be stopped now
It is outrageous that there should still be places in the world in which the stoning of women is a lawful and accepted form of death penalty
The Amina Lawal case again makes it necessary to take every possible measure to emphasise the EU 's rejection of such barbaric and inhumane methods
Nigeria is not the only country in the world in which such cruel@@ ties take place
In Nigeria , the difference between nationally and regionally applicable legislation must be brought to an end
It is shocking that there should be no guarantee of Amina Lawal 's ever appearing before a national court , even though the Nigerian Constitution guarantees her life and dignity
There is still a long and tough struggle to be undertaken to ensure that human rights are both accepted and observed in every country of the world
Madam President , I welcome this joint resolution on behalf of Amina Lawal Kur@@ ami
This is the second time we will adopt a resolution on behalf of Amina Lawal
I have no doubt that the first , in September 2002 , contributed greatly to the international appeal for mercy that has helped to ensure her safety thus far
I was asked at that time to launch an appeal on her behalf
I would like to thank the thousands of people who responded , both in 2002 and to the recent appeal within the past weeks
I also thank the European office dealing with human rights in Nigeria
To be condemned to death by stoning for having a child out of we@@ d@@ lock is a breach of internationally agreed human rights
I realise that this execution is not the wish of the Nigerian Government
I thank in particular the Nigerian Ambassador to Ireland , His Ex@@ cell@@ ency Mr E@@ lias Na@@ than , who has publicly appealed for mercy on behalf of this mother
Regional legislation must be in keeping with the international laws in place nationally in Nigeria
I am aware that Mrs Lawal has not been restrained or held in detention since her sentencing in March 2002
But we can only imagine the trauma that she has suffered with a death sentence hanging over her head throughout the past year
Certainly she has been sick and has gone to several hospitals for treatment during this difficult time
Even though Amina Lawal would have the right to appeal her verdict before a non-@@ religious court , she has suffered enough
I appeal for mercy and assurance that she will not be executed under any circumstance
We must also remember that she is not the only woman in these circumstances
Whilst we respect national sovereignty there is a better way forward for Nigeria and its people
We call for an immediate and lasting response to our parliamentary resolution
This , I am sad to say , echoes the obscurantism of the Middle Ages that our countries also experienced
Madam President , Commissioner , the Nigerian Government should declare that the application of the Sharia by a regional court of justice is counter to the Constitution of its country
In this regard , we would remind it , in particular , that respect for human rights is a fundamental element of the agreements concluded with third countries
I also fully agree with the questions raised by Mrs Karamanou
Apart from adopting resolutions , Commissioner - although this is also addressed to the representatives of the Council - what are we actually doing ?
Madam President , we are concerned here with saving the life of an innocent person and with a completely unfair judgment
It is a matter of questioning clearly , steadfastly , patiently and consistently whether Sharia law really is compatible with human rights and the UN Convention on Human Rights
We must do everything possible to influence Nigeria 's Supreme Court
We must also be able to question whether it is reasonable for Sharia law to be so fundamentally at odds with international law and human dignity
Madam President , honourable Members , the Commission does , of course , share Parliament 's concerns about the sort of punishments inflicted in northern Nigeria under Sharia law
As various Members of this House have already mentioned , Amina Lawal 's appeal is due to be heard on 25 March
Amina Lawal has been allowed legal counsel and will also have the opportunity to take her appeal to an even higher court if necessary
Sharia law is a complex and delicate issue in Nigeria
The closest possible attention is being paid to Nigeria 's adherence to the principles of the Cotonou Agreement
The debate is closed
The vote will take place in a moment
This is the name of a Swedish company experiencing problems similar to those of the companies referred to in the motion for a joint resolution
Is there any objection to the application of this oral amendment ?
The Moder@@ ate delegation has today voted in favour of the resolution on the closure of undertakings after receiving EU financial aid
What , instead , is required as a basis for creating more jobs are deregulation , lower taxes and fewer barriers to trade
If the European Union is to have any possibility of achieving the Lisbon objective , the Structural Funds ' aid activities should cease as soon as possible
Now , just before the vote , there are still numerous post@@ ers hanging on the walls
That is not in the interests of this honourable House
I ask that action be taken with the utmost rigour
Mr K@@ nol@@ le , we are going to contact the competent departments to ensure that the instructions have been applied
That was the last item on the agenda
I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned
( The sitting was closed at 5
The sole item on today 's agenda is the war in Iraq
We should offer the various groups the opportunity to table resolutions and express the conclusion of this debate through a vote
Otherwise , our debate will have no effect
Mr President , I endorse this statement
I believe we need a resolution in order to define Parliament 's position on a war that is going to destroy a nation
There has been an agreement to hold this extraordinary sitting today
The decision taken by the Conference of Presidents on today 's sitting was for a debate without a resolution
I shall follow that decision and respect the procedures involved
I give the floor to Mr Pap@@ an@@ dre@@ ou , President-in-Office of the Council
Fe@@ el@@ ings are running high because , when diplomacy ends and war begins , it is a sad , disappointing moment
As the President said , the Iraqi crisis has been the cause of numerous heated debates within our House , within the international community and within the UN
The Greek Presidency supported this objec@@ tive; we took initiatives and we met all our permanent and non-permanent members of the UN Security Council on numerous occasions
We also had several meetings with the leaders of the United States , Kofi Annan and the inspectors
However , what I would say is that we had a heated debate which will have important results and serious repercussions on future developments
We need to examine the implications of this crisis within the European Union and the international community and the UN and decide how to tackle them
Di@@ ffering opinions were expressed about the expediency of intervention , about the repercussions of intervening or not intervening and about stability in the region
Because the fact of the matter is that hostilities have now begun
Secondly , we need to examine the problems the Gulf will face in the immediate future , problems such as a possible humanitarian crisis
To paraphrase ? ofi Annan at the Security Council yesterday , the international community will perhaps finally unite around the fate of the Iraqi people
A second important consideration is the need to secure the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq
A third important problem is the stability of the region as a whole
A war can destabilise and cause problems for neighbouring countries , one of which , Turkey , is a candidate country of the European Union
Another important consideration for the region , for stability in the Middle East , is the Middle East problem and the peace process itself
As far as this process is concerned , the European Union is unanimously behind the so-called roadmap , which it wants not just published but implemented as quickly as possible
Whatever happens in Iraq , we need to highlight the su@@ pre@@ mely important role of the United Nations in the overall process
Luckily , there is unanimity here too
I think that , within this , we shall face another two important issues
As we all know , trans-Atlantic relations have been through - is still going through - a serious crisis
Of that there can be no doubt
The fact that we have been cooperating very closely with the Arab world over recent weeks is also extremely important
This cooperation , Mr President , honourable Members , has shown that the conflict in Iraq is not and must not be a cultural war or conflict
On the contrary , we must strengthen these ties with the Arab and Muslim world
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you very much , I look forward to receiving your comments
Mr President , as you said earlier , last week the Parliament debated the crisis in Iraq for almost four and a half hours
It was a very good and responsible debate
But at least I will spare the President this speech in Latin
This debate takes place against an extremely som@@ bre background
I just pause to make one point about transatlantic relations
It is equally the case that most of the things that America wants are more likely to be achieved if America can work with the European Union
And finally , it is un@@ argu@@ ably the case that the world is better served in terms of prosperity , security and stability when America and the European Union work together
The Greek Presidency made heroic efforts to maintain a common position
The European Council 's declaration of 17 February was , in my view , extremely well judged
However , they disagreed - all too publicly - about when that point had been reached
How can we now pull things together again ?
How can we emerge not just heal@@ ed but strengthened from the trials of the last few weeks ?
We should remind ourselves how closely and effectively we are cooperating - not just within the European Union but across the Atlantic - on a host of international issues
We should redouble our efforts
In the Balkans , for example , we are working flat out for economic and political stabilisation
After the fighting of 2001 , the European Union pledged that it was there for the long haul , to help deliver stability and sound government
This House helped to ensure that we put resources behind that pledge
I repeat what I said to this House last week , that we must also maintain the momentum of our own enlargement
The decision to bring in ten new Member States is not some whim , which might be called into question by unrelated events
It is a strategic choice for our continent
And it is a choice of historic proportions
We must press forward und@@ a@@ unted , just as we must press forward with the work we announced in our paper last week on Wi@@ der Europe
We must press forward , too , with the Middle East peace process
But we must ensure that this means the urgent implementation of these ideas , not a long discussion with the parties about their validity
Such discussions have proved to be endlessly frustrating in the past , as the parties have sought to impose incompatible conditions upon their cooperation
We really cannot allow this peace process , once again , to be subject to conditional sequ@@ en@@ cing so that in practice there is no peace but more bloodshed
More immediately , the whole European Union must strive to build on what we share in our approach to the conflict now beginning in Iraq
The Commission has been working hard behind the scenes , in cooperation with international agencies , to contribute to the humanitarian assistance that may be needed
I have discussed these issues myself in Jordan , Turkey and Iran in recent weeks
ECHO , the Commission 's Humanitarian Aid Office , has reinforced its presence in the region
ECHO has also kept regular contact with the main humanitarian organisations such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees
Since January this year , ECHO has carried out three missions to Iraq itself to assess the situation and prepare for possible operations
It has also conducted several missions to neighbouring countries
If there were a crisis in a neighbouring country , it would be possible to agree another EUR 3 million for that purpose , too
Depending on the scale of the needs , we may need to apply for additional funds for humanitarian purposes from the emergency reserve
Some international organisations and NGOs are also predicting food shortages , with disruption of the Oil for Food programme
That is something we may need to look at in due course , if the problem emerges
In all this effort , ECHO will work closely with UN agencies , and will participate in on-the-spot information exchanges
I should like to add one point here
Nobody in this House , I am sure , under-@@ estimates the courage and commitment of our humanitarian aid teams in the field
The Commission will continue monitoring and assessing the situation closely and would look , with the Council , at possible EU responses
I think trying to develop our relationship with Iran makes considerable sense
We should hope as well that it will be possible to deliver humanitarian aid quickly and effectively , under international auspices , where it is most needed
We should hope that the political and economic reconstruction of Iraq can begin soon , again under international auspices
We should hope , then , that reconstruction under international auspices can begin , guaranteeing Iraq 's territorial integrity and providing for Iraqi ownership of the process
We face a very clear choice in the coming months
Or do we try to rebuild the institutions and habits of global governance which have been so painfully constructed in the last half-@@ century ?
That is the clear choice which is going to face us
I know which side of the argument I come down on
Ladies and gentlemen , when we , in our present situation , consider what is happening tonight , we have to get to the root causes of it
It is Saddam Hussein who is responsible for the developments that are going on around us
We regret the fact that the UN Security Council was not able to agree on the attitude to take to the disarmament of Iraq
' We have no ambition in Iraq except to remove a threat and restore control of that country to its own people
If this is to be the objective , then our group is right behind him@@ ; this is something about which one cannot be neutral
Ladies and gentlemen , there is no cause for anti-Americanism
Although I am speaking here as a European , that is something I can say as a German
Gor@@ bac@@ he@@ v , break the wall down
It is that that we must remember today
That is the responsibility that we ourselves bear today
That is what we must require of ourselves at the present time
Mr President , Mr President-in-Office of the Council , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , these are grave times
The chron@@ ic@@ le of a war fore@@ told is becoming reality
the punishment it suffers under Saddam Hussein , and the additional punishment of an unjust war
Our current situation is really very difficult
The European Union is divided , the United Nations is in deadlock and we are witnessing the philosophy of the unavoidable war
However , we must not indulge in pessimism or de@@ fea@@ tism
This is something we must persevere with
The difference between us is in the rhythm and the means
In other words , we must be able to ask ourselves why we Europeans have become so radically divided
And that is our responsibility
Ladies and gentlemen , the question is not whether or not we are friends of the United States
We are loyal partners and not servants
The difference at the moment is that we do not share the Bush Administration 's doctrine of pre-emptive attack
And I do not accept that Jim@@ my Car@@ ter is any less American because he argues that this war is unjust
There is no place for this in today 's world
Commissioner , my group will vote for humanitarian aid administered by civilians in Iraq
This is therefore a responsibility for the Commission
And therefore we cannot live in fear and terror
We must live in a positive way
Dialogue cannot begin on the basis of threats and war
This is an essential point
If we believe in the United Nations , we must support it and we must strengthen it
We cannot unilaterally take the responsibility of saying that what has been done so far makes no sense
Mr President , this is not a just war
We prefer the force of argument to the argument of force
Nonetheless , much as we ab@@ h@@ or Saddam Hussein 's regime , we deeply regret that as we break@@ fast@@ ed in Brussels the bombs were falling on Baghdad
They might also take care not to lit@@ ter the Iraqi desert with depleted uranium
This will require the lifting of sanctions and immediate humanitarian aid
It means uniting the different communities of Iraq and the building of stable institutions to secure the future
It is important that the US does not act unilaterally in deciding the fate of Iraq
Once this war is over , the European Union must be a standard be@@ arer for humanitarian values
We must be broad@@ minded and generous and assume fully our responsibilities in the rebuilding of Iraq
This is not the moment to ha@@ ggle with the USA over the cost of reconstruction
Europe must play its part with no hidden agenda
They must also discuss , and be prepared to discuss when the crisis is over , why Europe has failed over Iraq
Mr President , as dawn broke over Baghdad this morning , the people were awo@@ ken by the awful , deafening sound of the first bombs falling on the city
These people were the very men , women and children who some of us saw going about their daily lives , met and questioned just a few weeks ago
We are haunted by their faces at this terrible time
They know that 3 000 missiles will be dropped on Iraq from the first phase of the war
President Bush bra@@ zen@@ ly refers to notions of honour and moral principles and appeals to God , when he has taken the most inhumane and inexcusable of decisions
President Bush plans to launch an attack against this country involving 600 fighter planes , 70 war@@ ships , 6 aircraft carriers , colum@@ ns of tanks and 300 000 soldiers
It is possible that some of the 600 journalists embedded in the armed forces will bring us pictures of popular rejoicing
Perhaps we will see Iraqi people welcoming their liber@@ ators with sweets and flow@@ ers
This is what we have been promised by George W
Bush and K@@ anan M@@ ak@@ i@@ ya , a prominent figure amongst pro-@@ American Iraqi ex@@ iles
This just shows the depth of knowledge of this country and consideration of its future at the very highest level of political power in the United States
Can it really be true that these are the people who intend to decide on peace or war , instead of the international community ?
What are they offering the Iraqi people ?
The Iraqi people will doubtless not mour@@ n the loss of their dictator
Will there be a long-term American military occupation of one of the largest and most emb@@ le@@ matic of Arab countries ?
Furthermore , what are they offering the rest of the world ?
Will they pursue battles with other rogue states ?
This is what General W@@ es@@ ley Clar@@ k , the former head of NATO forces in Yugoslavia , has led us to believe
Do we really know the extent of the destabilising chain reaction we are initiating in the region ?
This will pose a threat to the whole world
A superpower with the greatest supremacy the world has ever known is openly affirming its imperialism , even if this means exacerbating divisions , increasing worldwide unrest and nurturing terrorism
History will note that public opposition to this irresponsible policy was mobilised and expressed strongly throughout the world
History will note that courageous people , including the leaders of the Ch@@ urches , made their voices heard
History will note that some governments dared to raise their voices in opposition and stand their ground in the face of pressure , slander and even threats
What will we remember about the role of Europe in this historic situation ?
I must say that I have not heard any comments this morning on the fundamental issue
Will the European Union dare to demand the immediate end of this unjust , illegal and dangerous war ?
What will it have to say about the fate of the Iraqi people , ?
Whether or not there is unanimity between all the Member States , there are stakes that Europe can and must win , whatever the circumstances
What is at stake is the fundamental basis of the international system , in place since 1945 , and the law it embodies in the eyes of all democracies
Europe must therefore express its view on the new strategic doctrine of the Bush administration , which ex@@ al@@ ts military force , justifies a unilateralist approach and legitimises pre-emptive war
Now , in allowing the war against Iraq to go ahead , we are allowing the situation in the Middle East to deteriorate to the lowest possible level
The President of the Arab League has warned that we are opening the gates of hell
Parliament is the only European institution to have made its stance on this war clear
I would like to remind you of the terms of the resolution we adopted on 30 January this year
Parliament reaffirmed its commitment to peace and the rule of international law
We voiced our full support for the work of Dr Hans B@@ li@@ x and Mr El@@ Bar@@ ade@@ i
We expressed the opinion that the violations of resolution 14@@ 41 thus far identified by the inspectors did not justify military action
We voiced our opposition to any unilateral military action
We expressed our view that any pre-emptive attack would contravene both international law and the Charter of the United Nations
We stated that such action would result in an even greater crisis involving other countries in the region
This , at least , will provide our President with the basis of a clear , explicit and strong intervention to make at the European Council today
In light of the extremely serious situation developing before our very eyes , which may seriously deteriorate , we must assume our responsibilities and turn the tide of war
Old Europe must prove itself capable of setting out a vision of a new world
We must listen to the urgent pleas of our fellow citizens
Mr President , I would like to start by thanking you for holding this debate , this extraordinary sitting
A similar sitting was held at the start of the first Gulf War
Mr President , Mr Bush 's declaration of war is illegal
The British Government is just splitting ha@@ irs in its pathetic attempts to justify military attack
The United Nations has not failed
It has represented the view of world public opinion correctly
The future heralded by tonight 's attack is a future of war
This completely arbitrary action , the lack of credibility of President Bush 's speeches on democracy and the law now leave us bewil@@ dered and require us to act
We would like the Commission , the guardian of the Treaties , and Parliament to say so loud and clear
The European Union , Commissioner Patten , cannot be reduced to a humanitarian agency ,
and Parliament cannot be reduced to a humanitarian agency advisory board
We consider that the United Kingdom and Spain 's support of an attack to which even their own public are opposed is rash , illegal and incomprehensible
This is the challenge before us , before the Convention , although it does not always appear to be aware of the fact
There are , however , more urgent , pressing signals we must send out , and the first concerns the Middle East
It will clearly be up to the European Union to make sure that the road map is genuinely implemented
Mr President , we are expecting an initiative in this regard
It would be a serious , very serious mistake to postpone the Euro-Mediterranean Forum due to take place in Crete at the end of the month
That would be another unnecessary sign of impotence , which we really cannot afford at this time
Presidents , ladies and gentlemen , this morning I feel both sad and uneasy
I feel somewhat uneasy , however , because I actually believe that we have all been to some extent taken for a ride
I therefore believe that the decision to use force was taken several months ago
We were encouraged to discuss disarmament by peaceful means and this gave the United States the time to muster its forces
do you want , do we want , a Europe that is independent of the United States ?
We are told today that Iraq is dividing the European Union
This is not true , ladies and gentlemen
The Iraqi affair is merely revealing the true picture
The European Union is deeply divided
Some European States will always give the alliance with the United States priority over the construction of an independent Europe
That is the reality of the situation
This is the fault neither of France nor of Germany
If , however , we wish to see an independent Europe , we must also realise that this will come at a price
If the European Union wishes to exist , it must be given the means to do so
This is how things are@@ ; this is the reality of the situation
Everything else is incidental
Mr President , like most groups , the EDD Group is divided
Some of us consider war inevitable , some of us do not
Our common task is to limit it as much as possible and warn neighbouring states not to interfere
Let us pray that this war will end as soon as possible to avoid more innocent people becoming victims
Let us then draw lessons from this and look forward to a lasting peace in the whole region , including peace between Israel and Palestine
The Member States of the EU can help with aid for development , and the opening-up of our markets should bring prosperity to the region
That approach may be the only means of avoiding an escalation of terrorism
Kofi Annan wants a rapid reaction force to intervene for peace
Why do we not go for that instead of making a common EU military force ?
In conclusion , it is clear that a common foreign and security policy decided by qualified majority is not a solution
In the European Council there is no qualified majority amongst those supporting the war , neither is there a qualified majority amongst those opposing it
The group of five has a blocking minority , and the group of 10 has a blocking minority
A common foreign policy following new rules on qualified majority would be a basket with nothing in it
The only realistic approach is for the EU to continue the consensus and leave questions of war and peace to the United Nations
The war is a present to us from law-@@ abiding Europe , your Europe
Will we have the strength ?
We are not going to shout ' Peace
' and then murder it as we did 70 years ago
You are as law-@@ abiding as Vic@@ h@@ y
We are acting as unlawfully as the Iraqi resistance , as unlawfully as the European resistance
We tell you now that we are going to throw ourselves into battle without delay and fight for peace founded on freedom and the rule of law
I have to say that , listening to this debate , I quite wonder whether some people ever intended that these resolutions should be implemented
Today is not a day , however , to argue our differences over the reasons for this
As the Commissioner has said , there are lessons which the UN , NATO and Europe will have to learn for the future
That includes the practical reality of reaching a full European consensus when there clearly is division - there is even division in this debate
If we are committed to peace in the Middle East we should all welcome that announcement
I also welcome the recognition of the role of the UN in post-war reconstruction in Iraq
I am very encouraged by what Commissioner Patten had to say today about reconstruction after what I thought was a rather different message last week
Failure to confront Hussein now would create dangers to those freedoms in the future
To my alarm I discover that some in this Parliament are willing to accept political responsibility
Had we not , I thought , actually agreed that we wanted to work through the Security Council ?
That we wanted to give our backing to Kofi Annan , Hans B@@ li@@ x and the weapons inspectors in the attempt to disarm Saddam ?
That we wanted Saddam before the International Court of Justice ?
My group , and I hope the majority of this Parliament , is not willing to accept any political responsibility for this
This means that we in this House call on all the Member States , all the governments of Europe , to make neither political nor military contributions to this war
Of course we are together responsible for reconstruction , of course we are together on the side of international law and the multilateral approach
Which is why we also say and I say here that Europe must not be the victim of the Pa@@ x Americ@@ ana of the US
We must again seek new unity within Europe
We must again seek that one voice , and that one voice is one of conflict prevention , one of contribution to international law and the multilateral approach
Then in spite of all the differences we must also actually seek that common ground
That common ground was and is the Security Council , is international law and can never be a unilateral step
Our common demand is , of course , that the war be limited
It is , of course , for Europe to be strengthened
It is , of course , for efforts within the reality that we are experiencing today to ensure that we again take international initiatives
The President-in-Office , Mr Pap@@ an@@ dre@@ ou , has rightly said that today with the leaders we will again have to think up measures
As you are together as leaders today , respect this voice of the European population and realise that this voice stands on the side of peace and international law
For this we need a strong Europe and a strong United Nations
I hope that our European leaders will hear this voice today
Mr President , the unilateral attack by the United States demonstrates once again that the United Nations has not been a valid instrument
The European Union has also demonstrated that the common foreign policy has not been common
Perhaps we should remember 30 August 19@@ 54 when a European Union of defence became impossible
I regret the letter of the eight members
I also regret that the Spanish Government has expended more energy justifying the use of arms than seeking diplomatic solutions to the conflict
Mr President , war has begun and we have had the first ten Iraqi deaths in Baghdad
These are facts
From now on weapons will be doing the talking and words will become weapon@@ s; they are no longer reliable
Let us look at the facts and the real agenda that is being employed will become clear
What must our agenda be ?
Our peoples are deeply disillusion@@ ed , Mr President-in-Office , because Europe with its powerful institutions has been unable to avoid this war
Our European politicians will have to answer to their people for their impotence
Our European politicians will have to find solutions if they are to provide a real answer for this in the future
We in the European Union must try to relieve the misery and ease the suffering
War destroys and , as Mr van den Berg has said , we shall therefore have to build an international framework for reconstruction
people know where the war begins , but no one knows where it may end
The Kurds in Northern Iraq fear the loss of what little freedom and autonomy they have built up so pain@@ st@@ ak@@ ingly and at the cost of so many lives
They again fear finding themselves between the hammer and the an@@ vil
Will the Kurds be sacrificed to do Ankara a favour ?
The Turkish Kurds are fearful of being militarily overwhelmed
The Kurds in Northern Iraq fear permanent occupation
The Iranian opposition fears that the mul@@ lahs will take the opportunity to destroy them
Will the European Union see the opposition in Iraq being completely sidelined ?
In the Middle East the frustrations will flare up higher than ever
Only a solution with a Palestinian state , which is clearly coming , can bring these frustrations to an end
No , the no@@ vel@@ ty of the day is that the age-old dream of multilateralism and collective security , which inspired the entire twentieth century , has been shattered
Like the League of Nations once did , the UN is cr@@ umbling into in@@ significance
The international community is nothing but a hollow formula for supporting the empire and its Anglo-Saxon fl@@ un@@ keys
All that remains are States and only France , assisted by Belgium and Germany , remains to save Europe 's honour
' The European Union is dead
Long live the sovereignty of the world 's nations
Long live the Iraqi nation
From now on the leaders of the coalition can be neither indignant nor astonished when they become the prime targets of terrorist reprisals
Perhaps the only thing that could be done there is talk , but that will at least be doing something to achieve peace
Mr President , we all regret Europe 's failure in this crisis and the fact that the existing instruments for coordinating our foreign policy have shown themselves to be ineffective
Despite the obvious differences within the European Union , there are certain things which I believe , now more than ever , we are obliged to do together
I would ask the European Commission to reflect on whether it was hasty in some of the statements it made in this regard
At times like this it is easier to look the other way , it is easier to hide behind a banner than to confront tyranny
What we must do is respect the opinions of others
However , experience has taught us , Mr President , that force is the only response to oppression , and we are only servants of our democratic convictions
Mr President , if we had to choose between US democracy and Iraqi dictatorship , the choice would be easy
If we had to choose between the transatlantic alliance and the dictators , the choice would be easy
Kofi Annan represents the law , Bush does not
Prime Minister Sim@@ itis and President Prodi represent the Union , the others do not
In whose name did George Bush deliver the ultimat@@ um to Saddam Hussein ?
In whose name did Tony Blair and José Maria Aznar disregard the document signed at the European Council on 17 February ?
We had scheduled the Euro-Mediterranean Forum for next week in Greece , Mr President , as you know , to discuss peace , social progress and peaceful coexistence
Even if the dictator falls soon , the arrogant nature of this action will remain
In 1991 , there was the UN
In 1995 and 1998 , the UN , NATO and the European Union were unanimous
In 2001 the entire world supported George Bush and the United States in the fight against terrorism
A great deal of damage has been done
In effect , Mr President , war broke out on 17 September 2002 , when the new strategy of the Bush approach was announced to the world
Even if the dictator falls , I must stress , we have lost
The Europeans who are true friends of the Americans , of the citizens of the United States , cannot support George Bush
After the Second World War , we decided that never again would there be an A@@ us@@ ch@@ wit@@ z , never again would there be a war
The rest of the film shows the extent of the suffering awaiting the family
For , as a last resort , the combat taking place will set soldiers from democratic States against a totalitarian State
And in the face of such a situation , it is impossible to remain neutral
Mr President , war is an evil , but in some cases it can be the lesser of two evils
The war has begun and Europe has been unable to prevent it
We must therefore do all we can , Europe must do all it can to ensure that this war is the lesser evil
Mr President , ' the United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities , so we will rise to ours '
With this sad but entirely justified observation , America 's President Bush gave notice of the liberation of Iraq , the region and the world from Saddam Hussein
Military action against this merciless ty@@ rant is not only fully justifi@@ ed; it is even a boun@@ den duty
The UN resolutions are clear in this respect
It was high time we took action against the local , regional and global danger posed by this hear@@ tless ty@@ rant with his weapons of mass destruction
At the same time , it is of the greatest importance to repair damaged transatlantic relations
Let us - in Europe , America and elsewhere - recover our unanimity and together commit ourselves to a free and democratic Iraq
We pray for compassion towards the Iraqi people and soldiers and their families
We also pray that we in the European Parliament will , together with President Bush , acknowledge our dependence upon God
Have we forgotten September 11 already ?
Even today , we have heard hon@@ e@@ yed words spoken to the Arab world
have you seen or heard Arab television ?
It pro@@ claims loud and clear what the crow@@ ds of Arabs , including the immigrants living in our cities , want to hear
Yet when Saddam Hussein draws the men@@ ac@@ ing sword of Islam and pro@@ claims Jihad , it is we Europeans who will be his direct , closest target
May God prevent a disaster in London , Milan or Brussels such as that caused by Arab fanaticism on September 11 in Man@@ h@@ att@@ an
Even so , many of the public have doubts when considering whether this good objective justifies the sacrifices involved
My own doubts about this have not been dispe@@ lled , either
We now have to be prompt in providing aid for the people in the aftermath of war and for the purpose of stabilising the region
Especially , though , we have to do our own homework
Other ways and means must be found to create this world order , and this is something we must achieve together
Mr President , having won less than a quarter of the electorate 's vote , George W
Bush is the least well-@@ supported president in US history
Although he is in power , he does not represent the American people , to whom Europe owes a great deal and with whom we share so many values
It is precisely these values that Bush is scor@@ ning , with his warmongering cronies and his disregard for Europe
Bush wanted this war
His target is indisputably an unacceptable regime , but there are other dictatorships that also deserve to be eradicated
The universal reign of democracy and human rights , however , will not be established through the use of weapons and cultural violation
President Bush will certainly succeed in bringing down Saddam Hussein 's regime by military force
It will , however , be at the cost of many innocent victims and significant collateral damage in Iraq and the surrounding area
The risk of an extremely costly , prolonged conflict is clear
Such conflict would be punctuated with terrorist incidents and suicide attacks , leading to further division and a consequent spiral of violence in the region and beyond
The economic cost as well as the human cost could exceed the intrinsic cost of the war , which is estimated at USD 100 billion
The world economy has been experiencing a minor recession for the past three years
The financial markets have seen stock losses exceeding a trillion dollars
Banks , insurance companies and pension funds have been weakened
International trade has slowed down
If consumers in the United States and Europe were to lose confidence , internal demand would collapse and lead the global economy into a prolonged recession
Mr President , history will look harshly upon those who have chosen military action over a promising diplomatic process supported by the United Nations
Mr President , we see how , after months and years of negotiation , diplomacy has failed to disarm the Iraqi regime peacefully
There are thus many things that we might find regrettable about the approach that has been adopted
First among them would no doubt have to be the way in which the European Union itself approved the intervention in Kosovo in 1999
Today , however , we must draw a line under our regrets
Let us not allow ourselves to be led astray
Now , we must do everything possible to safeguard both the Iraqi civilian population and the future of an Iraq liberated from tyranny
With this in mind , Mr President , the European Council meeting this afternoon would do well to recall these objectives and unite around them
Mr President , in today 's debate I believe we are faced with a double frustration
Firstly , the frustration that peace has regrettably not been possible
And I would like to say that peace is not the exclusive domain of any political group , of any Member of this Parliament , or of any government
Peace is a universal value which is expressed and lived by an individual according to the ethical conscience of that individual
There is also frustration , Mr President , at the insufficient role played by the European Union in this conflict
Mr President , we must mobilise all our resources
We must turn need into a virtue and try to turn the discord of the present into harmony in the future
Mr President , this war was a foregone conclusion
Popular protest was ignored and UN backing dispensed with
What other foregone conclusions will be applied using the same modus operandi , with us again hoping they will end quickly ?
President Bush maintains that he is fighting the dictator and the dictatorship , which he compares with the democracy which he and all of us serve
Is this the difference between democracy and dictatorship ?
Is this the difference between dictators and democrats ?
I have posed four questions which bring me to a very simple conclusion
We too have responsibilities for this world , rooted in the democracy we serve and defend
Mr President , I am afraid that all endeavours to bring the Iraqi crisis to an end without using force have failed
it is he who is responsible for the current events
We cannot compare President Bush to Saddam Hussein
I am afraid that Europe has shown itself to be divided on this matter
It is our immediate duty to seek to restore unity to the Union
Today 's European Council , Mr Pap@@ an@@ dre@@ ou , can be the start of a new endeavour to give Europe a single foreign policy and a single defence policy
We can take practical steps to reinvigorate the European action , Commissioner Patten , once the Iraq conflict is over
The Union , together with the United Nations , must take the lead in building the new Iraqi democracy
The inspections produced evident results and , as Mr B@@ li@@ x himself said , opened the way to genuine disarmament by Iraq without the need to engage in armed conflict
President Jacques Chirac and French diplomats have not ceased their unequivocal condemnation of Saddam Hussein 's regime
In the event of a chemical or biological attack , France will give them every support in the form of humanitarian aid
A conflict such as this , however , jeopardises the efforts made over 50 years to build a world founded upon law and collective security
This conflict both greatly endangers the political stability of the Middle East as a whole and creates the risk that terrorism will again inflict devastation on a global scale
All we can do is hope that it will come to an end as quickly as possible
On this sad day , I am extremely proud to be French , for my country has been unstinting in its efforts to attempt to avert this futile war
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the time for illusions is past , and now we must face reality
Saddam Hussein 's criminal regime must be dis@@ armed
That is what most of us in the House want , and to that the United Nations has committed itself in almost innumerable resolutions of its Security Council
What matters now , therefore , is this war be brought to a speedy conclusion , sparing , if at all possible , those not actively involved in it
I believe that one of the illusions that we must cast off is the role of the European Union
It is obvious , though , that the Europeans have failed
When will Europeans at last learn that the world will listen to them only when they speak with one voice ?
against Iran , against Kuwait , and against the Kurds , using chemical weapons in his own country
These wars led to millions of deaths and produced millions of refugees , 50 000 of whom live in the Netherlands
Meanwhile , there are strong indications that these chemical and biological weapons have also been placed in the hands of terrorist organisations
What those groups are capable of , we saw on 11 September in New York
I was still a child when American , Canadian , British and Polish soldiers ris@@ ked their lives in order to liberate Europe and my own country in 1945
Since then , I have often wondered how many millions of lives could have been saved if we had intervened as early as in the 1930s
That is how I see this action now , as an action designed to prevent much greater disasters in the future
Finally , there will be a very great need , once this war is over , for the healing of wounds
Iraq will need a very great deal of help
EU Member States will have to reflect upon their behaviour during the last week in the Security Council
Mr President , in the past few months , the common foreign and security policy has very obviously proved to be devoid of any content
One might think it should be possible for the EU Member States to stand shoulder to shoulder when democracy is challenged by dictatorship
We might ask ourselves what right we have to ask countries that have experienced decades of dictatorship to abandon their democratic ideals
It will take time to heal the wounds inflicted upon European cooperation during the last few weeks and months
Even so , we must work more single-mindedly than before to build an EU that can speak with one voice and act with one agenda in the world
The voice and the agenda must , however , be ones that we can be proud of
There must be one voice that speaks for freedom , democracy and human rights , and not only on our own continent
Mr President , honourable Members of the European Parliament , the summit is due to meet tonight
It will discuss exactly what we have discussed here this morning
Your president , Mr Pat Cox , will have the opportunity to address the meeting on behalf of the European Parliament and we await his comments with interest
Here too the perceptions have differed
This is a strength , not a weakness
It is the basic principle of democracy
Our wag@@ er , our challenge is to find the synthesis from this democratic thesis and antithesis , the common will to move forward
The presidency also assures you that it will do its job to help achieve this aspiration and reach this synthesis
We know , as do the Fifteen , that we always have a responsibility to approach and achieve this common will
Numerous members of the European Parliament spoke of the need to heed the voice of the citizens of Europe and their unity and common will
Nonetheless , numerous common messages emerged from these different perceptions
Of course , the first was acute disappointment at the failure of diplomatic efforts
The second was the need for our humanitarian presence
Commissioner Chris Patten spoke about this
We have to turn our attention to the Iraqi people
Hunger , refugees , the cold , possible problems in northern Iraq , vulnerable groups , displaced persons , these are all problems waiting to happen
Thirdly , numerous references were made to reconstruction
But here again we have an important responsibility
We also have a serious responsibility , as many of you pointed out , towards neighbouring countries
In the Arab world , several Members pointed out that dialogue here is difficult at the moment
I would say the opposite is true , because the European Union has authority in the Arab world
The initiatives the European Union is taking , our constant understanding with them , have shown that there is no cultural divide
Even the citizens shouting for peace in our streets have proven that
The invitation extended to the presidency of the European Union by the leaders of the Arab world to visit Sharm el S@@ hei@@ k was not a happy coincidence
I also welcome the initiatives taken by the European Parliament to arrange meetings with parliamentarians , regardless of when they take place
Finally , an important message emerged about our relations with the United States
Numerous speakers emphasised that the point is not whether we are for or against the Americans
That is not where the problem lies
Whether we are friends or not is not the point
As Mr Crespo and several other speakers said , we are partners and partners need to talk on equal terms
Talking on equal terms means , as Mr Poettering said , that we ourselves need a strong Union
We need a single voice and we need to be able to take on more and more responsibility in international affairs
We need to give serious consideration to the future development of our defence and foreign policy and we need systematic dialogue with the United States
I do not know how many I convinced , but they certainly went away thinking more about our position than before
That is what the European Union is
Different nations , different languages , even different traditions , but with a common will based on principles , based on these values
We have done a massive amount of peace work on the basis of these principles
We are continuing this magn@@ um op@@ us by enlarging and promoting our international role
Whether this will come about today , tomorrow or in a few months ' time , I do not know
But the momentum is there
I should like to answer three of the points that were raised in this debate
Let me begin with the discussion on humanitarian aid and reconstruction
I want to do something which I always used to criticise the former Labour Prime Minister , Har@@ old Wil@@ son , for doing
I shall read to you one of my own speeches
I would just like to quote what I said last week and then move the debate on a little
After talking about humanitarian assistance , I said that ' immediate humanitarian help is one thing , but the demands upon us will certainly extend much beyond that
As the House is all too well aware , Europe 's external relations budget is already heavily committed
It will be very difficult in any circumstances to launch massive new programmes in Iraq and in the neighbourhood of Iraq
We have had representations already , for example , from the Jord@@ anian Government
I am not making a quasi-@@ legal point
I am simply offering a political judgement of no great no@@ vel@@ ty or s@@ ag@@ acity
I am delighted that since then , others have taken up a similar theme
There should be a new UN resolution following any conflict , providing not just for humanitarian help , but also for the administration and governance of Iraq
That must now be done under proper UN authorisation
These are not my words; they were from the speech made by the British Prime Minister , Tony Blair , in the House of Commons this week
I wonder , just in passing , whether it would have done so if we had never raised the point in the first place
Second , I should like to say a brief word about the United States and our relations with that country
Cri@@ tic@@ ising the United States is not the same as having a European foreign policy
It is equally the case that to disagree with the world view of Richard P@@ ear@@ le or Robert K@@ ag@@ an is not to be anti-@@ American
There are millions of Americans who disagree with Mr P@@ ear@@ le and Mr K@@ ag@@ an
I do not think that anybody accuses them of being anti-@@ American
Do we accuse most of the last Democratic administration of being anti-@@ American ?
Do we accuse a lot of Republi@@ cans today of being anti-@@ American ?
I am not prepared to be judged on my relationship with America by whether or not I agree with Richard P@@ ear@@ le
And since I am in an excessively candid mood , I shall make a third point
But let me remind the House of what the Treaty already says
Article 11 was referred to by the honourable Member in her extremely good speech
Article 11 , sub@@ paragraph 2 , says that ' The Member States shall work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity
They shall refrain from any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations '
I do not know how this translates but , as my late father would have said , pull the other leg
Institutional change can certainly help to create political will
But you cannot create political will through institutional change alone , and institutional change is not a substitute for political will
I am afraid that is a lesson which I have learned the hard way over the last three and a half years
That brings our extraordinary debate to a close
I should like to thank all colleagues who have participated and also the Council and the Commission for their participation
The debate has revealed that many differences remain , but also that they are based on honest and deep convictions , which also differ
I thank you for the calm , reflec@@ tive and respectful manner in which the debate has taken place
( The extraordinary sitting closed at 11
We shall continue to oppose war and to defend peace
I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Thursday , 20 March 2003
We are greatly saddened today to learn of the death after a long illness of our former colleague Mr José Au@@ reli@@ o de Bar@@ ro@@ s Moura on 25 March 2003
Mr Bar@@ ro@@ s Moura was a Member of this Parliament from 1986 to 1989 and then again from 1994 to 1999 in the Group of the Party of European Socialists
He was a Vice-President of the ACP-@@ EEC Joint Assembly
All those colleagues who knew him and worked with him appreciated greatly his personal qualities , his good nature and his openness
Above all , we recall him as a man of deep conviction and a strong and committed advocate of European integration
I would ask you to rise and observe a minute 's silence
Mr President , you have always shown a great deal of sensitivity when people , or even one person is killed in political violence anywhere in the world
Mr President , during the Strasbourg part-session I called on you to take up the case of a number of Cuban dissidents arrested in that country
They are members of the Christian Liber@@ ation Movement
A wave of new arrests took place during subsequent weeks
Journalists , dissidents and human rights defenders were targeted
It should be noted that all this coincides with the opening of the Commission 's permanent representation in Cuba
It also comes at a time when many Members of the House were giving favourable consideration to extending the Cotonou Convention to include Cuba
It may be desirable to continue dialogue with the Cuban people and their government , and to keep channels of communication open
This week I communicated precisely the concerns you mentioned on the last occasion to the Ambassador of the Mission of the Republic of Cuba
I outlined in detail our concerns and I shall forward you a copy of the correspondence
That is why many Members of Parliament and members of staff have decided to wear black arm@@ bands during this week 's part-session
We would ask for your understanding for this mark of solidarity with all the victims and with public opinion , which has come out against this war
I ask Council to redouble its efforts to bring about change for the better in Zimbabwe
Colleagues , as you know , our Rules of Procedure allow for a number of short speeches at the beginning of a sitting
I have taken a number , but many more colleagues wish to speak
I propose , with regard to those still wishing to speak , to invite you to make your points of order after our debate
The presidency of the Council is present and in terms of the dignity of the House , it should be appropriate now to proceed with our business
By letter of 7 March 2003 , Mr Olivier Dupuis requested the defence of his parliamentary immunity in a case pending before a court in Rome
Pursuant to Rule 6 of the Rules of Procedure , I have referred this request to the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market
Mr President , one of the Members of this House , Mr Cappato , has been detained in prison for three days by the British authorities
Mr President , I want to talk about what Mr Bigliardo said and the letter you have received regarding the immunity of Mr Dupuis
Mr P@@ ann@@ ella too has been given a four-@@ month jail sentence , comm@@ uted to eight months of conditional release , for civil dis@@ obedience with regard to drugs
Mr P@@ ann@@ ella , Mr Cappato and Mr Dupuis all subjected themselves to these sentences voluntarily without raising the question of their parliamentary immunity
it is for Parliament and the safeguarding of its work and its plenary sessions
The next item is the statements by the Council and the Commission on the outcome of the European Council of 21@@ -@@ 22 March and on Iraq
Ladies and gentlemen , the spring Council met in Brussels to discuss the economic and social situation in the Union
This was the third European Council summit meeting with this agenda
Before the Council was convened , the view was expressed that this Council should not meet or that it should deal solely with the war in Iraq
The Presidency did not agree with these views
We have a direct interest in developments in Iraq
We are particularly concerned that there should be no human casualties and we are particularly concerned about the civilian population in Iraq
It would have been wrong to allow the summit to become a casu@@ alty of the war
That would have played right into the hands of all those who take pleasure in highlighting Europe 's inability to cope with crucial situations
We know that people are filled with intense emotion about this issue , but everyone has the right to be listened to in se@@ ren@@ ity and with respect
I appeal to colleagues to please show that respect to the Prime Minister
You shall have your opportunity to speak
The European Council also concluded that considerable progress had been made with the Lisbon agenda , now entering its fourth year
Nonetheless , there is still a lot to do in order to achieve the Lisbon objectives
A great deal of effort is needed if we are to push ahead with our economic and social reforms
to raise employment and social cohesion is the first priority
The second priority is to promote innovation and entrepreneurship
The third priority is to strengthen the single market and connect Europe
We need to open up the European energy , transport and financial services markets and improve the regulatory framework and consumer protection
The final priority is environmental protection for growth and jobs
This means taking action in the environmental field and promoting new investments in clean and more resour@@ ce-@@ efficient technologies
The European Council issued guidelines
The conclusions contain guidelines on how to achieve the objectives I have mentioned
In 2003 , the European Union will have streamlined key policy coordination instruments
The Council ordered these tools to be streamlined and coordinated and to be given a three-year perspective , in order to make them more efficient
The Council took a series of decisions in specific sectors , such as employment and modernising the European social model
The Council urged the Member States to maintain the momentum of reform of national labour markets
Finally , I should like to mention that it laid down substantive regulations on safety at sea in the wake of the Prestige accident
Ladies and gentlemen , this - very briefly - was the outcome of discussions on the Lisbon strategy
Now I should like to say something on the subject of Iraq
It is also a known fact that there is acute disagreement as to how and when disarmament will take place
This issue was discussed repeatedly in the Security Council without any agreement being reached
On the contrary , the divisions widened
It would therefore have been pointless for the Presidency to hope that the differences which have emerged over all the past few months would be overcome at the Council
At the beginning , this effort was met with doubt
Could we discuss this sort of agenda ?
The Security Council , the conclusions state , will need to give the United Nations a mandate to deal with the post-war period
Another point was the need to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process , our determination to strengthen the common foreign and defence policy and the importance of the transatlantic partnership
Is the fact that we steered clear of the main problem a sign of hypocrisy , as some have suggested ?
The differences of opinion on the main problem were clear
The impasse was also clear
There was no point in discussing it
to what is important for the future
Perhaps some people would have preferred to widen the gap , to add more fuel to the fire ?
The future is every bit as important as the present
If we fail to address it , we shall find ourselves on a very slippery slope
Is the Union of Europe split at the moment ?
However , the answer is not to exacerbate the divide , the answer is to try and highlight where we can work together and pull in the same direction
The decision on Iraq was a decision based on the premise that the European Union has a voice and must have a voice in international affairs
Ladies and gentlemen , what is our objective ?
To get international relations working in a more widely acceptable manner at international level as quickly as possible
This presupposes that the United Nations , through its institutions , will issue the main guidelines on what is to happen after the war in Iraq
Its reinstatement from a challenged to an unchallenged international legal system will be achieved if it is clear that the United Nations are against taking on a central role
The decision emphasises the central role of the United Nations
With the differences of opinion over Iraq , numerous people concluded , sadly , that we have no common foreign policy
There are common positions on numerous foreign policy issues
On other issues , and on aspects of certain more general issues , the Union 's foreign policy is taking shape
Policies in other sectors are also taking shape
And there are also divisions in other sectors
Ladies and gentlemen , the European Union is constantly taking shape
That is why its development is a challenge , a challenge to think , to apply our knowledge and experience and work for a prosperous , secure future
The war in Iraq , which we have to deal with , is part of that challenge , which is why we cannot merely welcome or condemn it
We also need to look at the future prospects of Europe and the world
The United Nations have not yet managed to become a convincing , efficient institution , even though they are charged with addressing issues which are vital to the global community
And it will be some time before they do
The Brussels Summit showed that , despite our differences , we still feel Europe is the best way of preventing one new superpower from monopol@@ ising our co@@ smo@@ s
Europe 's ability to participate and influence a multipolar world must be kept alive with initiatives , cooperation and a belief in our common future
Mr President , as a supporter of the coalition war effort , when I displayed my poster which read ' Saddam Out
' , I was told by Vice-Presidents Dimitrakopoulos and Provan to remove it , as it was apparently against the Rules of the House
Can we please have a consistent ruling on this matter ?
The ruling is that these kinds of displays should not take place inside the Chamber
I will therefore begin my speech today with that
As I speak , a war is under way and no one can tell how much longer it will last
A war in which troops from some Member States are fighting in the region
A war that has caused great divisions within the Union
A war opposed by the overwhelming majority of European citizens and very many others throughout the world
A war which , like all wars , brings death and suffering in its train , even if it ultimately brings the fall of a dictator
I also want to reiterate the need for respect for human dignity , even between the belli@@ ge@@ rents
the extra funds requested for this operation - USD 74
7 billion - are much higher than the total amount of aid the world gives the poorest countries each year , which is only just over EUR 50 billion
They need to be highlighted in this debate too
There are many points we all agree on , then , and they are crucial
We should bear this in mind after all that has been said and written on our divisions in recent days and weeks
However , we must not try to pretend that these divisions are not there
We must not lie to ourselves or to our fellow citizens
Having listed these crucial points on which the Union is in agreement , we must admit that the European Union is going through a very rough patch
I am thinking about the role the Union should be playing and is not
Indeed , the issue of the enlarged Union 's foreign and defence policy is star@@ kly highlighted by world events
We must ask ourselves what role we want to play on the world scene
Let us start with security
The European citizens have already made it clear what they want
They want peace , multilateralism and a Europe - a Europe that brings security as well as peace - and they have made this abundantly clear recently
This is not an emotional reaction at a time of crisis , brought on by the natural anxiety and concern always triggered by war
It goes much deeper , and it would be a sin to ignore it , for it should unite us in purpose
Indeed , the Treaties require the Member States to ' support the Union 's external and security policy actively and unreservedly in a spirit of loyalty and mutual solidarity
They are , and I quote , to ' work together to enhance and develop their mutual political solidarity '
They must refrain from ' any action which is contrary to the interests of the Union or likely to impair its effectiveness as a cohesive force in international relations
How little the letter and the spirit of these Treaty provisions have been observed recently is plain to all
Let me take this opportunity to applaud the positive result of Slovenia 's referendum on accession , which has followed closely on Malta 's
Ladies and gentlemen , the road we have travelled in the last 60 years towards a united Europe has not been easy
There have been many rough pat@@ ches , but Europe has always drawn courage precisely from its deepest crises and used them as a springboard for its most spectacular advances
It was the failure of the ED@@ C - of the plan to create a European Defence Community - which created the impetus for the Treaty of Rome
Today , history is repeating itself
Europe 's future hangs on the way we face this crisis
In the field of defence , the last few days have brought the launch of an initiative that could take us far
Belgium , France and Germany have decided to look jointly at closer integration
Let us cast our minds back to Saint Mal@@ o in December 1998
The European Convention has created a working group on defence
In its conclusions , the working group stressed the need to develop European defence capabilities and to strengthen the industrial and technological base
Two weeks ago , the Commission adopted a Communication on def@@ ence@@ -related industrial and market issues with the aim of facilitating and fostering more effective coordination of a European def@@ en@@ ce-@@ equipment policy
Ladies and gentlemen , we Europeans are not from Ven@@ us , as some would suggest
The peoples of this old , wise Europe have a long and painful past
A past that has led us to base our Union on law and to work for an international order founded on right , not on might
I therefore call on this House and all the institutions represented in the Convention , and I appeal to all its Members directly not to miss this opportunity
Today as never before , we can seek to forge our own destiny , but we must learn the right lessons from past experience
At Maastricht , Europe laid the foundations for both Economic and Monetary Union and the common foreign and security policy , policies which we have too often disregarded
While the former has evolved to the point of putting the euro into the citizens ' pockets , the latter is still in its infancy
The institutions , the instruments and the decision-making mechanisms for implementing the two policies were quite different and so are the results
However much time it may take to fully implement our plans , the moment of truth for Europe 's foreign and defence policy has come
Ladies and gentlemen , I started off today by saying that the Spring European Council is the principle occasion when we review our economic progress each year
This year , there are some encouraging points , and we should not forget the great progress made recently in opening up markets
The process of opening up the telecommunications market is almost complete
The energy market is in the process of being opened up
Great progress has been made on mobility and on many aspects of social security
After years of work there is the agreement on the Community Patent
Here , too , however , we must be honest with ourselves
Our progress in implementing the reform strategy decided at Lisbon three years ago is too slow
I am not just talking about the widespread disappointment on the issue of savings tax
The growth rate of our economies is alarmingly below that required to create the jobs we need and to support the process of convergence of the acceding countries ' economies
The priorities for the Trans-European Networks were identified some time ago but , to date , they have not brought much in the way of results
Even the 14 projects given priority in 1994 at the Essen European Council are severely behind schedule
Investment in the Trans-European Networks currently stands at below EUR 20 billion per year
At this rate , it will take over 20 years to complete them all
It is therefore time to launch a major initiative to bring about a substantial increase in the funding of both the Trans-European Networks and the major research and development projects
These , ladies and gentlemen , are the preconditions for reinvigorating the Lisbon process and expanding the horizons of our knowledge
Joint research , networks of excellence , mobility of students and researchers and the key programmes on life sciences , renewable energy and the environment are vital
That , ladies and gentlemen , is precisely why there is no time to waste
At this time , we think of the coalition troops in Iraq , some 30 000 of them from a Member State of the European Union
Human dignity being indivisible , though , we think also of the Iraqi soldiers who are being misused by a criminal regime
Richard Per@@ le has said that both the UN and NATO had lost their contemporary relevance and were meaningless in the twenty-first century
That is where they are seeking security in the face of threats
That is why we have to give some thought to how to improve these institutions , but we must not question their existence
We do , of course , need proper trans-Atlantic relations and a trans-Atlantic partnership
We will soon be meeting them again in the forum of the World Trade Organisation , where the European Union must - and will - present a united front
Hence my plea to our American friends that they take the European Union seriously
The President of the Commission has praised the Belgian initiative on defence policy
We were highly critical when the British Prime Minister sent out invitations to dinner at No 10 D@@ owning Street , with some being invited and others not
We must make use of the Community institutions and work together in them
It always reminds us a bit of Ni@@ kit@@ a K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , who , in the 1960s , always wanted to overtake the USA , and we know what the result was
I would have liked more to have been said about monetary stability
A lot is being said about the Stability Pact 's flexibility
Let us just consider what the Euro is worth to us today
Let us imagine what things would be like if it did not exist - how then would our currencies be valued in relation to each other today ?
It is for that reason that we must defend the common European currency , and we need it to be a stable one
What is of pre-@@ eminent importance is globalisation , which is often decried - sometimes rightly , sometimes wrongly
Big businesses are able to seek out for themselves a business location where taxes are at their lowest , which small and medium-sized enterprises cannot do
This is where governments must take some action at last
Please allow me to make two comments by way of conclusion
We wish you success in your efforts to do this
For these things we will continue to campaign , and we ask that you put them into practice
In the light of recent events I fear it may yet be called upon to convene further summits
On behalf of my group , I should like to express our heartfelt condolences to the families of all the victims of this war
There must be no more victims
My group therefore believes the war must cease immediately
The United Nations must assume management of the conflict
The latter should never have been taken out of the United Nations framework
I also deeply regret the unilateral decision taken by the President of the United States to leave this framework and start a war
I support Mr Annan
Once again , I must emphasise that the present unilateral action is in breach of the United Nations Charter and of international law
On behalf of my group I should like to further reiterate our complete opposition to the doctrine of pre-emptive attack as an instrument of foreign policy
I would like to repeat what Mr Co@@ ok said in the House of Commons
Multilateral agreements and a world order governed by rules afford better protection to our British and European interests than unilateral instruments
Mr Poettering quoted Mr Per@@ le , a spokesperson for the armaments industry
Mr Per@@ le is a shameless lobby@@ ist
He wrote an article thanking God for the failure of the UN
Given that so many are swe@@ aring by some God 's name or taking it in vain , I should like to seize this opportunity of sending out a timely reminder
There is a fallen an@@ gel in both the Bible and the Koran
The fallen angels , who were angels of light , are named Lu@@ ci@@ fer and I@@ bl@@ is respectively
Their fall was caused by pride and unbridled blind arrogance
That is the very situation we are currently faced with
Ladies and gentlemen , no war is a clean war
The doc@@ to@@ red images presented to us conceal horror
We are today receiving pictures of that market in Baghdad
You will recall that the European Union evolved from a common market
No doubt you also recall another market , in Sarajevo , and how that was bombed
I hope your consciences are stirred
We are all involved in a conflict which is becoming increasingly horrific
They wish to enjoy freedom and dignity
Clearly too , they do not wish to have further death and destruction inflicted on them
This action was taken unilaterally , outside the framework of the Security Council
It has resulted in disaster , because very often the local population does not perceive the troops as a liberating force
The people are determined to protect what is theirs , to defend their land
Furthermore , this region is beset by many complex problems
It is most unwise to destabilise it further , and this could impact the Middle East process
Both the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office of the Council have insisted that this crisis and future action must be dealt with within the UN framework
Indeed , I have said so twice already in this House
I have , however , read today 's newspaper and apparently the management of the port of U@@ mm Q@@ as@@ ar has been awarded to a United States company
The latter is offering to sub@@ contract some of the work to European companies
This flies in the face of respect for the UN
Is the European Union to be invited to do sub@@ contract work for the UN ?
That is not the way forward
I believe we should make our voice heard
We must insist on humanitarian aid being administered in a civilian framework , and furthermore , within the UN framework
Aid must not be administered by any of the powers currently involved
I should like to make a final point before I finish and leave the floor to my colleague Mr Goebbels
He will speak on the Spring Council
My point is as follows
We know the President of the United States has already estimated the cost of the war at USD 75 000 million per month
Oil prices and exchange rates are on a roller coast@@ er
In conclusion , Mr President , we have to recognise that public opinion is riven by emotion
It is dis@@ concerted and overwhelmingly opposed to this war
I refer to wider public opinion , not just to European public opinion
The public does not understand the urgency of this war or the reasons for it
There is a world-wide movement for peace
I have in mind Saturday 's demonstration
It falls to us to relaunch the multilateral approach to international relations
The dignity and legitimacy of the United Nations must be restored
It will then be in a position to fulfil its role as a government for the world
The European Union failed to act as one and therefore bears a share of the responsibility for this crisis
We must be able to envisage a future in which the Union can construct a foreign and security policy worthy of the name
This is essential if we are to act hon@@ ourably in the interest of the future of all humankind
Mr President , the war with Iraq inevitably overshadowed the Council 's important economic reform agenda
It is only natural that , at such a time , economic issues should take second place to matters of life and death
So before turning to the conflict with Iraq , I will say a few words about economic reform
I should like to cite just three examples
5 % - instead , the proportion rose last year to over 2 %
That hardly augurs well for the Italian presidency
raising levels of employment
It is impressive that we managed to create half a million jobs last year despite the economic slowdown
But the scale of the task ahead becomes clear when we note that unemployment in the EU as a whole rose last year to nearly 8 %
' If in doubt , create a task force '
Humanitarian aid must get through
We see from the situation in Bas@@ ra just how important that is
The horror transmitted through our television screens shows us just how necessary it is to get our relief agencies in and working
I welcome Mr Prodi 's proposal for EUR 3 million of immediate humanitarian aid through the Red Cross
Liberal Democrats will support the rapid approval by our House of your request for the release of a further EUR 70 million from the emergency budget reserve
The EU has been damaged by the divisions of recent weeks
I agree with the Council that we need to strengthen transatlantic relations
My group also welcomes Belgium 's proposal for a ministerial meeting on North Korea
If the situation in Iraq had been discussed at the Seville Summit - as Mr Verhofstadt proposed - we might not be at six@@ es and sev@@ ens today
Any such policy must deal with conflicts - not only the specific conflicts themselves , but also their causes - and promote cooperation across the board
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , I would like right now - and without repeating too much - to draw your attention to three primary problems
For a start , my group continues to insist that this war be brought to an immediate end
Secondly , there is no doubt that this war puts the USA in breach of international law
It is even now openly threatening to break international law again
Last week , and quite openly , Mr Rumsfeld , the Secretary for Defence , ordered that the armed forces in the Gulf region be equipped with C@@ S gas
I call upon you to object to the US administration 's disregard and violation of such crucial international treaties , and to do so in unmis@@ take@@ able terms
Thirdly , in Iraq there are tens of thousands of Iranians opposed to the regime in their own country , as well as Kurdish refugees from Turkey
Ling@@ ering in refugee camps , their fate attracts no international attention
They are very much at risk from this war and the threat of massacre hangs over them
Above all , Mr Sim@@ itis , have the courage to demand that the USA put an end to this war
Mr President , I recently attended a debate at a school in Germany
To my surprise , I was faced with a banner reminiscent of demonstrations my cont@@ em@@ por@@ aries and I were involved in , back in the mis@@ ts of time
Em@@ bla@@ z@@ oned on this banner was a text to the effect that making war to preserve peace is like making love to preserve your vir@@ gin@@ ity
I have not quoted the exact English version so as to preserve some eleg@@ ance
I am sure none of you will have difficulty understanding it
Mr President , you are quite right when you say this war is an intellectual challenge
I would add that it is also a physical one
P@@ la@@ in@@ ly , we are allowing our divisions to st@@ unt our intellectual fac@@ ul@@ ties
It is also plain that a number of Council declarations have a surreal quality
So too have statements made by Members of this House
P@@ la@@ in@@ ly too , we are all in favour of humanitarian aid
That is the one point on which there is general consensus , and on this I agree with Mr Watson
The issue we are confronted with today is quite straightforward , however
Will Parliament make a clear statement on this war or will it not ?
Will Parliament be tar@@ red with the same brush as the Council of Ministers or the General Affairs Council or will we achieve a majority tomorrow ?
I appeal to those who do not want a majority at any price
The choice is between two clearly defined positions
One is the stance taken by the coalition of those in favour of the war because they believe it is important and necessary , as has just been stated
They can go ahead and vote for a resolution that might read as follows
Right is on your side
O@@ ff you go , in the name of God , liberate the planet and show how to make love without losing one 's vir@@ gin@@ ity
They have every right to do so
The second position involves obtaining a majority in this House to reject war as an option
Such a majority was achieved at the end of January when the war was declared illegal
Ac@@ commod@@ ation will be called for in order to obtain a majority against the war
If we are unable to make compromises we shall show ourselves to be as intellectually st@@ unted as the Brussels Council
That is the problem confronting us today
Some state that the war was not sanctioned by the United Nations
Others state it is neither legal nor legitimate
I maintain it all comes to the same thing , and that only honourable Members skilled in hair@@ -@@ splitting could come up with differences in meaning between these various phrases
Obviously , having established that the war does not have the backing of the United Nations , it can be said to lack legitimacy
Consequently if this motion is passed , we will have no@@ tched up a victory
Turning to the text of the resolution , a heated debate is in progress over the form of words
I do not therefore believe it is a matter of vocabulary
I should like to make one further point quite clear before I conclude
Some Heads of Government are intent on keeping certain lies alive
The reason why the Security Council did not vote for the resolution tabled by the United States , United Kingdom and Spain was not a French or Russian veto
The reason was that there was no moral majority in the Security Council in favour of going to war
That is the plain truth
On this basis Chile and Mexico had the courage to table a resolution which rightly retained inspections as the way forward
It should be borne in mind that both these countries are economically dependent on the United States
The moral majority that emerged on the Security Council in favour of intervention in Kosovo was 13 to 2
No such majority emerged in favour of intervention in Iraq
That is a historical fact
The rest is simply a bra@@ zen lie kept alive by Heads of Government afraid of their own people
One must call a spade a spade
If we win , we will have won a greater battle than a mere battle of words
Each group will then be able to resort to its ideology to defend the common view
If we are prepared to make compromises I am confident we can win this moral victory over the advocates of war tomorrow
Mr President , we cannot deny for one moment that the last number of weeks have portrayed the European Union in a very poor light
The Greek Government tried vali@@ antly to secure a common political position on Iraq and Europe , but notwithstanding its tenacious and determined efforts , this objective could not be secured
The Greek Government must be commended for the measured approach it has taken during this very turbulent time for the European Union
We must remember that the European Union has been through difficulties before and has always managed to rebuild itself in the face of ad@@ versity
This is the core of the challenges we now face
The European Union has brought political stability to the people of Europe for over 50 years
We must not , and cannot , lose sight of this fact , but we must look at the bigger picture
The European Union as a political and economic entity has brought prosperity and a sense of political purpose to the people of Europe
We have an internal market , we have a single European currency and the European Union is shortly to increase in size to 25 Member States
These are all real political achievements which are contributing to the standard of living and the quality of life for many people in Europe
We can all be proud of these achievements because we all played a key role in making them a reality
The events of the last few weeks have rocked the European Union to its foundation
I welcome the conclusions of the Brussels summit and the commitment of the European Union to rebuild bridges with America and to support the transatlantic relationship
America and Europe can achieve so much across a range of measures when they work together , as opposed to working against the interests of one another
We must try to rebuild this relationship as a matter of urgency
The European Union must carry out its moral political duties in ensuring that the humanitarian problems of Iraq are addressed with vigour and determination
We must continue to work with the United Nations , whose authority has also been very badly shaken in recent times
Like many others here today , I greatly wish for a speedy end to the war in Iraq
This is our duty , a duty which , last week , the EU leaders recognised must be faced up to
I believe the European Parliament must take a similar political position here today
I should like to say to the Presidents that there is a degree of masoch@@ ism in linking a series of debates at European summits in this way
Indeed , as the Greek Presidency indicated , these summits represent the high point of hypocrisy
I refer to the Europe of the institutions
All the institutions came out in favour of the same approach
They all declared themselves in favour of the approach put forward by France , Germany and Belgium
It involved giving precedence to the law enshrined in the United Nations Security Council
For once too , the Europe of the institutions was at one with the people of Europe
The people of Europe also gave overwhelming indeed unanimous support to this same approach
We may actually be witnessing the birth of a new form of European political public opinion transcen@@ ding national boundaries
Europe certainly did speak with a single voice
Even better , Europe spoke with the same voice
Mr Prodi , vacu@@ ous statements are being attributed to Mus@@ sol@@ ini
He might well have said that when it came down to it , governing Italy was not as difficult
The difficulty lay in that it served no purpose
In the light of current developments , it seems to me that Europe is in danger of becoming an Italy raised to the power of 15 and later of 25
The difficulty is not quite as Mr Sim@@ itis described it
This is not some kind of agricultural marathon , where one has to ad@@ judic@@ ate between carrots and tur@@ ni@@ ps
Mr Sim@@ itis , your comments were unworthy of your position
For the first time since the Treaty of Rome , Europe finds itself divided on objectives rather than on methods , means or timetables
One half of Europe has become the ad@@ versary of the other
That is the crux of the issue
We are up against two opposing concepts of law , two opposing visions of the world , two opposing co@@ smo@@ g@@ onies
That last word comes from Greek , Mr Sim@@ itis
In this very House , you have seen bann@@ ers emb@@ la@@ z@@ oned with Stop the killers , and others with Give a chance to war
Do you really believe this is like dealing with carrots and tur@@ ni@@ ps when no decision has yet been taken on the film 's ending ?
Mr Sim@@ itis , euro@@ speak is no different from other meaningless political speak
Mr Prodi , you referred to a European defence system
There has been much talk of one
Europe 's last chance could indeed be to create a genuinely European defence system
I have to tell you here and now , however , that this debate will take place in other fora , including the level of the Convention
The European defence system will not be created within NATO any more than the single currency was created in For@@ t K@@ no@@ x
Why not say ethical , D@@ any ?
Tomorrow , our task will be not to seek a humble , secular political majority on specific objectives , but rather to build a moral majority in this House
G@@ o and get yourselves killed with your ethics , with your mor@@ als , with your qu@@ ests for absolu@@ tes , with your dig@@ res@@ sions
Of course we want peace , but not the ' rest in peace ' kind
It is no use confining ourselves to a diagnosis of the current tragic situation and a prog@@ no@@ sis of its in@@ auspicious prospects , however
I should like to suggest to the Presidents that the traffic jams in Brussels were the only visible result of the summit
It was clear beforehand that the summit would be divided on Iraq and stalemate would ensue
We were resigned to the Union being confirmed in its role as a political d@@ war@@ f
To have the so-called economic giant settle for the lowest common denominator in its economic , social and environmental conclusions is , however , cause for despair
The world is threatened by a serious recession that will probably last longer than previously anticipated due to the war in Iraq
Yet we are treated to empty words
The Presidency is not to blame
Nonetheless , it has seen fit to present us with 37 pages of conclusions , containing 12 6@@ 40 words
I would remind you that Mo@@ ses managed to write the Ten Comm@@ and@@ ments in a mere 180 words
The summit must have had one san@@ e moment though
Paragraph 9 of the conclusions reads as follows
'@@ Nonetheless , there is still a lot to do
It is time (
) for the Union and the Member States to fulfil their commitments regarding (
) by translating words into action
With regard to action , the European Council invited the Commission to consider several problems
Between now and the 2004 spring summit the people of Europe can expect at least 17 new action plans , road maps and other reports
The Commission was invited to produce a report on tightening up the use of structural indicators
There is to be a plan of action on entrepreneurship and another on simplifying and improving the regulatory framework
Instead of a framework directive on public services , agreed on first at Nice and again at Barcelona , we are to have a Green Paper on the subject
The mu@@ st-@@ have list even includes a study on the means the European Union could deploy to assist the people of Iraq to live in freedom , dignity and prosperity
Further to the Van Mi@@ ert report on missing links in trans-European networks following enlargement , the so-called Competitiveness Council was invited to specify the guidelines required in terms of connec@@ tivity
No connec@@ tivity means fewer exchanges and less growth
Nonetheless , the Council failed to take any decisions to remedy the obvious shortcomings of the infrastructure of an enlarged Europe
As long as the Union is forced to manage on 1 % of the Community GDP , it will be reduced to making empty gestures
Mr Poettering is concerned for the euro
I have to say that our single currency is holding up pretty well against the dollar and other international currencies , despite the French and German deficits
If monetary stability really has to be preserved for the public good , then exceptional situations call for courageous measures
The cost of the war and the subsequent cost of the peace will be a heavy burden for the economy of the world
A policy to revive the economy is vital if Europe is to avoid deep recession
Mr President , I wonder why the Commission is delaying application of the flexibility provided by the Amsterdam Council 's resolution for times of recession
I wonder too what it is waiting for to encourage investment pursuant to Rule 11 of the Council Regulations dated that very 7 July 1997
I trust it will not wait for an official statement that our economies are in difficulty before taking action
You shall have to do a report to answer that question , Mr Goebbels
I join with him in condemning the conflict in Iraq and calling for agreements within the framework of the United Nations , of course
I also join with him in wishing to commit the European Union to regaining its unity
The Union must then contribute to rebuilding the affected areas so a process of peace and stability can actually be consolidated and guaranteed
The European Union was unable to demonstrate the unity required
Sadly , it was therefore unable to exert its influence as we had hoped
I trust that at least we shall now be capable of first regaining our unity and then of leading the peace
I should also like to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results of the Brussels Council held last week
The Council was devoted in particular to consideration of the so-called Lisbon process
During debates and discussion at Strasbourg it had already emerged that we have little to congratulate ourselves on in this regard
In terms of productivity and competitiveness , the gap between Europe and the United States has not narrowed
As we understand it , the reason is that the appropriate structural reforms were not carried out
Also , the discipline promised concerning key aspects such as the promotion of research and development activities failed to materialise
New enterprises capable of taking on board innovation and new technological processes were not encouraged either
Obviously , all this has hampered the development hoped for
I believe the secret of effective implementation of the Lisbon process commitments lies in the area of structural reform
It is equally important to promote research and development activities and the activities of small and medium-sized enterprises , in conjunction with proposals for social improvements
George Bush , the president of the United States Government , is himself the clearest indication of the crisis in that country
This Parliament must not fall in with the logic of war; it must call for the UN General Assembly to convene immediately in order to demand a cease-fire
His attitude is ridiculous and paranoid
As we all know , economic uncertainties and global political risks confront us and make alterations difficult
We in the European Union should recognise that our hands are tied , to a certain extent , to the kind of things that we can achieve
However , there are opportunities within our system that allow us to build on the positive developments
Economic and social dimensions are intertwined in reaching the 2010 objectives
Alongside this , the whole question of education and the kind of skills training that is given to people must be brought into focus
We must be more flexi@@ bil@@ ity-@@ friendly , not setting down rigid regulations and rules which drive economic investment out of the European Union , sending it to low-cost labour areas
Employment is the one way that we can guarantee overcoming poverty and social disadvantage
However , not just any kind of employment will achieve that
It is the quality of jobs and the quality of entitlements that will make it happen
There are two other points that I want to make very briefly
First of all , one of the key elements must be protection of our environment
The last point I wish to make is one of a personal nature with regard to Iraq
I compliment the Greek Presidency , which was able to s@@ ne@@ ak that in by concentrating on what was politically achievable
I call on the Commission to put forward concrete proposals for both kinds of aid as soon as possible
The declaration on the territorial integrity of M@@ eso@@ pota@@ mia is of particular importance , as this is currently threatened by Turkey 's plans to enter Iraq
What means does the Council plan to use to prevent Turkey from doing this ?
I fear that political pressure alone will not be enough
Is the Council also willing to impose far-reaching political or economic sanctions against Turkey if the Turks actually cross the Iraqi border ?
I for my part think these should include postponing or abandoning her accession to Europe
Finally , the declaration shows great appreciation of the United Nations
In@@ flexibility and an unwillingness to compromise are really not the sole preserve of the Americans
In the light of the events of the past few weeks , I therefore find Europe 's de@@ vo@@ tion to the UN painfully hollow
Further to the conclusions devoted to Iraq it seems rather to be cast as a humanitarian NGO
As for the glori@@ fication of the CFSP in conclusion 69 , this is clearly what sur@@ re@@ alist writers term automatic writing
The question arises as to whether it really is in Europe 's interest to resort to language of this kind to play down the current split
Ever since the question of Iraq arose , our continent has become a virtual battle@@ field
The battle is between two visions of Europe 's rightful role in the world and also about the very organisation of the international system
Europe is currently at the heart of a fundamental debate with implications for the future of the whole international community
There is discussion on whether Europe should be independent or aligned , whether there should be unilateralism or agreement between nations
The European Union itself is not participating in the debate , but Europe is certainly involved
Along with the United States , Europe is one of the main interlocutors in the form of two tro@@ ik@@ as
On the one hand there is Par@@ is-@@ Ber@@ lin@@ -@@ Moscow , and on the other Lon@@ don@@ -@@ Mad@@ ri@@ d-@@ Rome
Each of these tro@@ ik@@ as has its rationale and support
For one this is enshrined in the New York memorandum , and for the other in the Declaration of the Azores
I query whether the only way of dealing with these two views is to deplore them
To do so is to confirm a mono@@ li@@ th@@ ic vision of Europe , whereas diversity has always been our distinguishing feature
We would certainly deserve it if we were only intent on evading the impact of confrontation , for the sole benefit of sp@@ in@@ eless and meaningless consensus
Robert K@@ ag@@ an might be proved right
No matter if what Europe says has no impact , so long as Europe says it with one voice
Is that really our aim ?
Should it be necessary to stifle all differences of opinion to be a true European ?
Could not the spirit of free competition be applied also to foreign policy ?
Mr President , the Spring Summit was held under very difficult circumstances
I will not mention the situation in Iraq because my group chairman has already done so and my fellow countryman and colleague A@@ rie Oostlander will be doing so
I will therefore concentrate on the socio-economic aspect
It is clear that the uncertainty about the consequences of the war and its duration will have and is having an impact on the world economy
I think , however , that we must also realise that the growth in unemployment in Europe naturally started long before that
I must say that the Spring Summit delivered more than I had anticipated
So in this spirit , I would like to congratulate the Greek Presidency
We acknowledge that small and medium-sized enterprises have a significant role to play in the area of employment
We now need to actually implement the charter we established for SMEs , for example , but also the action plan for the simplification of regulation
We have been talking about the need to make it easier for SMEs to access investment capital for so long now
Why do we not do it , why can we not just get rid of these obstructions ?
How are we going to close this gap , and what efforts will have to be made by the various Member States ?
It is now time for deeds
And however much our foreign policy divides us at the moment , our economic policy is equally well able to unite us
Those who supported the Lisbon strategy for regenerating the European economy were right about one thing
Their programme , with the resources which needed to be mobilised , was a programme with a long-term return
That is precisely where we stand at the moment
That is where our duty lies
If we fight for this , the day will dawn when truth will also prevail for us in Europe
Now , the war is under way , however , and we must look to the future
Those who were carrying plac@@ ards here in the Chamber , bearing the words ' Stop the killing
' should call to mind how many hundreds of thousands of people have been murdered and driven out of the country by Saddam Hussein
The post-war period will see some arduous work begin , first of all of course in the form of humanitarian aid
Following that , Iraq must be reconstructed
St@@ able and democratic institutions must be created so that the Iraqi people can at last live in freedom and peace
The UN must have ultimate responsibility for this work , and the EU must make a generous contribution
Iraq must not become an American protectorate
What is more , new life must be brea@@ thed into the peace process in the Middle East
Transatlantic relations , which are in tat@@ ters , must be repaired
Finally , the EU must get its act together and show that it has learned from the dé@@ b@@ â@@ cle of recent weeks
We need a common foreign policy
We can expect even this from the fundamentalist culture of Bush 's council
I have seen an Iraqi baby 's lac@@ erated head , lac@@ erated by the weapons of those who call themselves liber@@ ators
With this war , the m@@ asks have come off
United States militar@@ ism is a danger to the international commun@@ ity; a policy of domination and death is a d@@ an@@ se mac@@ ab@@ re between terrorism and this policy
How can we make the countries waging this war of aggression comply with the agreement ratified in the United Nations after the Second World War ?
we will take care of the reconstruction
Our efforts should be channelled into stopping an unlawful war
The present , Mr Sim@@ itis , is the past and also the future
This is why we must prevent Iraqi , British and American citizens dying
and so let us convene the Security Council and the United Nations Assembly
Europe must be united , of course , but it must be united in saying ' no ' and in ending this war
Mr President , I welcome the presence of the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission
The war against Iraq is completely without justification and must therefore be condemned
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , that is something on which the Council remains silent
In the war against Iraq , cluster bombs and landmines are to be used , in contravention of international law
The Council remains silent about that , Mr President
Anyone who has been in Iraq will know what the situation there is like
Just as we do , you represent the majority of Europe 's citizens , and you can be sure of their support
I urge you to take responsibility and stop this war
Mr President , the 18@@ 15 Congress was criticised for amusing itself while there was a war on
One could take a cue from history and lay the same charge against the members of the Council
In the shameful summary document issued , the word Iraq first appears only on page 31 of the 36 pages of the Presidency conclusions
Mr President-in-Office of the Council , your distressing verbal statement proved the Union 's failure and powerlessness
The war is happening
It is an event of major significance
With Great Britain at their head , the Union 's members are directly responsible for it
Yet you say we can do nothing about it and we should change the subject
There is actually a lot to be said , now that the lies used by the Bri@@ tish@@ -@@ American Empire to justify its brutal aggression have been revealed as what they are
It claimed the war was about enabling the UN to disarm Iraq
That was a lie
The war had in fact been planned from the outset , regardless of any developments
You ventured to say the Security Council was stalled because it had not voted a resolution authorising the war
That was a lie
The Security Council was not stalled
It had adopted a procedure that was working
Iraq was supposed to be weakened
It had been systematically star@@ ved for ten years , and forced to disarm in exchange for promises of peace
It was meant to collapse during the first few hours of battle
That proved to be another lie
Iraq is offering strong , often heroic resistance
The people of Iraq were going to greet the troops of the Bri@@ tish@@ -@@ American empire as a liberating army
That too was a lie
The people perceive the troops as an army of occupation
Iraq was said to possess weapons of mass destruction
The whole spectrum of fal@@ se@@ hoods on this subject has been aired , from the most sinister to the most ridiculous
I have in mind Tony Blair 's statement on 5 February
He brought shame upon himself when he presented a report justifying aggression
Eleven of the 19 pages of the document were based on a student di@@ ary dating back some ten years
To date , the only weapons of mass destruction recorded are the millions of sophisticated bombs and missiles the Anglo-Saxon empire is using to wipe out Iraqi towns
As a lawyer , I have noted the cynical violation of all the legal provisions the British and Americans themselves put in place to prevent war
As a European , I regret the hatred of the Western world resulting from the use of the empire 's bombs
As a Christian , I am ag@@ ha@@ st that a blatantly unjust war should be waged in the name of God
I believe in calling a spade a spade
Tony Blair is merely an ur@@ ban@@ e murderer
That Saddam Hussein 's regime is a threat to world peace cannot be disputed , given the facts
Since its defeat in the first Gulf War , Iraq has been the object of many resolutions , with which it has generally not complied
This has never , however , resulted in their being enforced under the auspices of the UN
For a long time there were even attempts to have the sanctions against Iraq lifted
There was also barely any international reaction at all when the inspections were cut short on account of Iraq 's failure to cooperate
Yet Saddam Hussein 's obsession with the production of weapons of mass destruction was well-known
Since then , his people have been oppressed and refugees have been and still are coming to our EU Member States
Iraq remained a fe@@ stering sore
There is no sign of peace there
Our patience with this can run out too quickly , indeed , but patience can also degenerate into indifference
For many years this was apparent in our attitude towards the dramatic events in Yugoslavia
We now know that anyone who wants to establish justice must in extreme cases accept the support of force , including military force
Is there , however , sufficient formal basis under international law for the coalition 's military presence ?
I quote Ma@@ x van der Sto@@ el , a well-known Socialist ex-@@ Minister of Foreign Affairs , High Commissioner for minorities at the OECD , a well-known , important Socialist spokesman
I find that a good left-wing stance
The debate at the time was about whether intervention should take place immediately , after one or two weeks or after six weeks
This debate is not sufficient to drum a clear message into the minds of those who risk their lives in the field
There is little point in their looking back
The question is whether we should now wish the coalition forces a swift victory so as to avoid long-@@ drawn-out misery both for the public and for themselves
I cannot imagine that any of us would not support the armies now
I think that it is important that justice takes its course for Saddam Hussein
It is a matter of regret that the UN Security Council has forfeited authority
Ve@@ toes are being used in a dishonest way , and votes are up for sale
The UN per se and its services will be more important than ever in post-war Iraq
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I vigorously contest what Mr Oostlander has said
If there is even a whis@@ per of doubt , you are assuming responsibility for endangering human lives
War must always be the last resort of politics , but it cannot be the last resort as long as the policy is a matter of doubt
If ever there were an avoidable war , this one is it
If this was the right way to go , why do you not summon up the courage to say that the war is the wrong way ?
That , after all , would be the logical conclusion to come to
Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to thank you for your speeches
I would also like to thank everyone who mentioned the Greek Presidency
I shall try and reply briefly to two or three questions
Many of you appealed directly to the Greek Presidency to take the initiative and state a specific opinion or take specific recourse to the United Nations
But what is the presidency 's role ?
The role of the presidency , not just the Greek Presidency , but any presidency , is not to decide what the European Union 's position is
It is not to welcome one opinion and condemn another
It is not to express its own views , because Greece too has its own views but it cannot express its views as the views of the Union
If it cannot manage to do that , then it has no place
That is the first thing it has to do
And we do not want division , especially in these difficult times
My second point is that a number of honourable Members referred to the Union 's foreign policy , again saying that it is non-existent and that nothing has been done
We heard the President of the Commission say that a European Union peacekeeping force will most probably take over the role of the NATO force in Skopje this week
This is unprecedented and is the outcome of serious effort in the foreign policy sector
Because the European Union has applied a foreign policy
There are several other examples of the really creative presence of the European Union I could mention
And we failed to unite our position on the basic , moral issue of war or peace
We have failed to do so on numerous other issues
We have to make that effort
Com@@ promises are also needed because you will be debating the problem of Iraq tomorrow
If we say it here loud and clear , we shall create frameworks , we shall create commitments
And , of course , we must not forget the peace process in the Middle East and the importance of transatlantic relations
The Union 's foreign policy , like every other policy , is created
This endeavour has its triumph@@ s and setbacks , but the policy is still created
If we simply say that the Union is out of its depth and we throw in the towel , then we do not want a Union
But we do want a Union
And we want a strong Union
Finally , I should like to refer to a number of comments made on economic policy
That is clear from the text
It is also clear from the text that war can upset the best-@@ laid plans
It is important not to panic , not to believe that we need to take measures here and now or here , there and everywhere
We need to keep moving steadily forward on the course we have set
Mr President , the resolution Parliament is now on the way towards adopting is back@@ war@@ d-@@ looking
Instead , we should have turned our attention to the future
It is not the coalition that is responsible for the war in Iraq@@ ; it is Saddam Hussein and his regime
I must therefore vote against conclusion number 3 , and I am unable to deplore or regret the decision taken by the coalition
It was Saddam Hussein who forced them to take it
Now , we must look forward , as in part does the resolution , I am pleased to say
Now , it is a question of preventing as much suffering as possible in the wake of the war
The Iraqi people have suffered enough
We must therefore be ready to come to their aid , and as soon as possible
We must take joint responsibility for peace and freedom in Iraq
That is the most important aspect of the resolution we are to vote on
Mr President , a new resolution on Iraq cannot be more conciliatory than the resolution we adopted by a large majority a few weeks ago
Many of us here are concerned about the future of the world and of Europe
This humiliation will continue if we somehow sanction the invasion of Iraq after the event
But why should we turn their technical supremacy into political victory by feeling compelled to condone the war once it is over ?
Those of us who have no intention of letting Europe and the world change into a sort of Jur@@ as@@ sic Par@@ k must move forward
Those here who are willing to achieve more must unravel the contradictions into which their selfish , divisive choices are forcing them on their own
We are the disease '
Mr President , how many more innocent victims will be added to those who have already fallen ?
With the agreement of the Security Council this war would still have been illegitimate but now it is both illegal and illegitimate
The power of the bombs dropped by the Americans and the British on that unfortunate country has doubtless already exceeded that of Hi@@ roshima and N@@ agas@@ ak@@ i
President Bush has spoken of a crusade
This one will no doubt meet the same fate as the last one
I salute the courageous resistance of the Iraqi people
I ask my Kurdish friends not to place too much trust in American promises
They know what those promises are worth
I hope that one day those who are responsible for this war - Bush , Aznar and Blair - will have to answer for their actions before an international court
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , our resolutions become no more convincing the more self-@@ righ@@ te@@ ously we be@@ labour one another with judgments about what is wrong and what right
We should be helping to find ways out of the crisis
We are currently finding out how much we are affected when the opposite happens
Then their soldiers had the responsibility of guaranteeing the freedom of our capital , Berlin
It is for those reasons that I am in solidarity with the United States , even though this solidarity has a critical edge to it from time to time
Mr President , I would like us to cast our minds back to September 11 2001
After those events we all agreed that the world had changed
We appreciated that global terrorism , a terrorism well-@@ financed and organised with no clear political objective beyond creating chaos , required a new approach to security
It was clear that we can no longer take a passive approach
We can no longer sit on the sidelines tu@@ t-@@ tu@@ tting when faced with dangerous , repressive regimes prepared to murder their own people , threaten regional security and nurture terrorism
We have particularly re@@ treated to the cold war attitude towards the United States
We feel that the transatlantic relationship is some sort of zero-@@ sum game
For one side to win , the other side has to lose
If we continue that process the world will become much more secure because every issue and every crisis will be divisive as we try to gather around separate po@@ les
We need transatlantic partnership for the benefit of world security
We must ensure that we get global certainties and agreements for the future and not re-@@ fight old battles
It may well be that the structures we set up after the second world war are not suitable for dealing with the post-@@ September 11 world
As I speak , many thousands of my own countrymen and women are putting their lives at risk to free a people from tyranny
I have not heard one word of condemnation of Iraqi troops killing their own people in Bas@@ ra
Imagine what British troops feel like seeing that happen and being powerless to stop it
Mr President , naturally I too regret that the United Nations have not found a solution to the conflict in Iraq
After all , we all agree that Saddam Hussein has been categorically opposing the United Nations for the past 12 years
Throughout his rule he has oppressed his people and violated international law in many areas
That is why the members of the Security Council accepted Resolution 14@@ 41 , and they must therefore now bear the consequences
Anyone who does not do so is , despite protests to the contrary and perhaps also unintentionally , implicitly helping to keep Saddam in power
Ex@@ plain that to the inhabitants of Bas@@ ra , who are being fired at by their own Iraqi army
This does not help international law and the Iraqi people in the slightest
It is no use lec@@ turing other people about international values if you are not able to enforce international law yourself
I felt that the European summit was not able to avoid deadlock on its other subject , the Lisbon process
Of course , this will get us nowhere when it comes to economic liberalisation
To conclude , therefore , I warmly welcome Commissioner Monti 's initiative in investigating the banned state support for the French energy group Elec@@ tric@@ ité de France
It is absolutely essential that we complete the internal market in order to be able to continue to compete with the USA and Japan
The dirty imperialist war met with heroic resistance from a nation defending its national independence , awakened consciences and provoked massive and continual demonstrations of protest
This policy will not go unanswered
For example , Paragraph 60 onwards of the Presidency Conclusions mentioned promoting sustainable development on a global scale
Those Conclusions talked about enhancement of corporate social and environmental responsibility , both at EU level and internationally
I would hope that it would apply to such issues as the granting of contracts on a fair and open basis - rather than giving them to your rich friends
The Conclusions also mention the means of promoting sustainable and fair trade
I hope that , in the aftermath of this Spring Summit , we are going to pay attention to the policies that we talked about there
Mr President , I should like to appeal for calm and tolerance in the House
After all , these are the cornerstones of European integration
The Group of the European People 's Party and European Democrats attempted to table a resolution on the basis of the Council 's declaration
Unfortunately at this stage consensus appears impossible
Some of the approaches put forward seem to aim in practice at calling for the European Union to become part of the movement of non-aligned countries
My group argues on the contrary for strengthening the transatlantic axis as a strategic priority for the European Union
We agree with the Council on this
It is therefore somewhat surprising to hear the Commission praise an initiative for common defence beyond the territory of the Union
It might be termed an extra-@@ Community venture
No eye@@ b@@ rows should be raised if others now table further proposals
The Council devoted a good deal of time to discussion of the eagerly awaited post-war period
It sent out an unequivocal call for European Union involvement in rebuilding Iraq
I would however point out that at present what is required of us is humanitarian aid for those most in need
I would have welcomed more specific details of action taken by the Commission in that regard
I trust this objective will unite us all , and that we will be prepared to reg@@ r@@ oup under the European flag as we strive towards it
A further issue that bro@@ oks no delay is ending the conflict in the Middle East
I would have welcomed the Commission 's comments on this too
Mr President , nobody in his or her right mind welcomes this war or any other
We cannot however fail to deal with international terrorism or threats to our security
We cannot either fail to deal with the state of complete bon@@ d@@ age the people of Iraq have had to endure up to the present
Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , the problem of Iraq seems to have divided the world into two opposing camps
However , the peace demonstrators have stood up in the whole of Europe and throughout the world in order to protest against the strongest military power in the world
We believed that a peaceful solution was possible in Iraq , thanks to the intervention of the inspectors , but the decision had already been taken
All wars in the Middle East have always ended in disaster
Why , then , are we incapable of learning the lessons of history ?
Our construction of Europe is based on right , rather than might
Yes , but we cannot deny that the European Union is experiencing a real crisis
The UN Charter has been flouted
Article 2 of that Charter asks all States to refrain from threatening the territorial or political integrity of any other State or to use force against that integrity
What has happened to our compliance with that article ?
Does this mean that there is no longer any law , any treaty , or any charter which is able to resist the law of the strongest power ?
That is a frightening thought
It would be a defeat for democracy , and we do not accept it
This war is a disaster from the moral viewpoint
All the great principles of our civilisation cannot be trampled underfoot in this way
It is time for us to react if we want a strong and independent Europe
It is time for us to put in place a common defence policy , and it will be necessary for us to provide ourselves with the resources to do so
We need to move , to make the Convention a success and to make our future together a success too
Our leaders are letting us down
One of the few silver lin@@ ings of this illegitimate war is that even in the UK more people realise how crucial it is to have a single European voice
Chirac should realise that making the EU a rival of the US is a no-@@ brain@@ er
Blair needs to understand that the route to partnership with Washington is via Brussels
On Iraq , what was missing from the Summit conclusions was a reference to preserving the devolved administration of the Kurds in the north
The Kurds have been betra@@ yed so often , but this time we must guarantee their freedom and identity
They must enjoy self-@@ government within a federal democratic Iraq
Mr President , the war being waged against Iraq is an imperialist war
A nation is being massac@@ red so that half a dozen trusts , whether they are oil companies or not , can redistribute the cards and the markets amongst themselves
Words such as liberty , democracy and the condemnation of Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship are merely hypocrisy to conceal a war of band@@ it@@ ry
What better illustration could there be of the fact that , despite of their differences of opinion , they are , above all , accomplices ?
Mr President , of course a democratic process is needed in Iraq , but war is never a solution
It is unfair , because it kills innocent people , and , as the Arab proverb says , a killer is never a bene@@ factor
Despite that massive rejection of this war by public opinion , the Council remains silent , whereas we ought to have condemned it
It is simplistic to believe that the objective of the United States is to control energy resources
We must recognise that Bush has succeeded in bringing off a double tour de force
Israel continues to violate international law with complete impunity
The Americ@@ anisation of the world , and the re-@@ drawing of the geopolitical map of the Middle East - are not these the real objectives ?
The European Union must play a vital role in rebuilding peace
It must help to create conditions in which the rights of nations can be respected and the territorial integrity and sovereignty of States can be guaranteed
In order to do this , however , it urgently needs to provide itself with a common foreign and defence policy
The future of Europe depends on it
Do we want to have a Europe of soldiers in the service of an American empire , or a Europe of independent citizens who respect fundamental rights ?
Clearly , as far as he is concerned , being pro-European means always saying yes , but if we sometimes say no , we might build a better Europe
It would be an extremely grave political error not to heal the present divisions
The strong , influential political Europe of the future cannot , however , be created with an anti-@@ American stance
We are on day seven , and the dramatic events tell us that it will not be a b@@ lit@@ z@@ k@@ ri@@ e@@ g
Then there is the Middle East
Certain interventionist quarters have said that this war will resolve the Middle East question
We do not think this is the case
what are you gaining from this terrible experience ?
incorporate , introduce federalist elements into your European foreign policy
If you do not do so , we will not have a common policy
Once again - it has already happened in the Balkans - we are powerless and at a highly critical time
Remember that the sum total of 15 or 25 national policies which satisfy longstanding interests , will never constitute a European foreign policy
What a disgrace it is that there are so many apolog@@ ists for Saddam Hussein in this Chamber
Listening to them I now understand the concept of the big lie
My own constituency of East An@@ g@@ lia has lost Tor@@ n@@ ado air@@ crew from Royal Air Force Mar@@ ham in Nor@@ fol@@ k
The Col@@ ch@@ ester@@ -based 16 Air As@@ sa@@ ult Bri@@ gade is also very much in the front line of the conflict , along with units from all over the United Kingdom
I have to say that the poisonous thread that has run through the diplomatic manoeuv@@ rings in the run-up to the Iraq war has been anti-Americanism
I am thinking particularly of the European security and defence policy , which is not about security but about the tra@@ pp@@ ings of the EU State
It creates no additional military capabilities , just duplic@@ ative and divisive structures from which important allies are deliberately excluded
This is a time when we should be doing just the opposite
We need to rebuild a western strategic culture
Europe 's citizens give us cause for hope , and their love of peace should be the foundation on which we construct a common foreign and security policy
The USA 's status as a military hy@@ per@@ power means , however , that it will not work without a military component
We simply have to be prepared to consult among ourselves on where we should concentrate our military expenditure
The next test of our met@@ tle , though , is almost upon us
It has too many repercussions for that , not only on the surrounding region , but also on Europe
Saddam Hussein himself could certainly have prevented it , if he had kept to at least one of the seventeen resolutions passed by the UN Security Council
This should also determine what resources are allocated to enable such a policy to be actually implemented
Any policy must in any case be founded upon the common interests of all , and must enable Europe to be one of the po@@ les in a multipolar world
Such a war , we said , would not be in compliance with either international law or the United National Charter
An illegal and neo-colonial war is currently underway
Every day it shows us its real face
This declaration said that the United Nations must continue to play a central role during and after the crisis
President Bush now has the war he always wanted , the war that he decided to wage a long time ago
As one French newspaper described him , he is in the position of a new-@@ look Doctor Str@@ ang@@ elo@@ ve
Am@@ ple proof has now been provided that some Member States do not want an independent common foreign and security policy
Well , political Europe will be constructed without them , in the same way as monetary union was
Mr President , it is quite a few years since the Lisbon targets were established
Since then , many fine words have been spoken about the significance of the Lisbon process
The objective was to catch up with the United States economically by 2010
Unfortunately , this has been mostly a matter of words
I have still not seen the necessary reforms of the labour market that are a condition for growth and so also for more jobs
Nor has the equally important liberalisation of , for example , the gas and electricity markets taken place
Compar@@ ison with the United States clearly shows how far we are from achieving the targets set in Lisbon
The Americans have made it clear that they will not just sit and watch while the economy deterior@@ ates
They have responded with deep tax cuts
That is something which the EU Member States should also do , and as a matter of urgency
An employment strategy was discussed at the European Council , but no such strategy will ever provide increased growth and lower unemployment
There are no short cuts
We do not need any more fine words or proud declarations
Action is what we need
As long as the EU just talks while the United States takes action , the economic gap will continue to widen , to America 's advantage
The year 2010 will continue to rec@@ ede ever further into the future
Let me get to the point and say that I am thinking of Afghanistan
The situation in Iraq , though , is quite different
There , we have not yet succeeded in persuading Muslims that a war there is as necessary as it was in Afghanistan , and their scepticism is something I share
While there really are not yet sufficient reasons for it , this war is - unfortunately - a reality
It is probable that , after the war , much of the work we have been doing for decades will have to be done again
Where some things are concerned , we will have to begin again from the ground up in order to convince Muslims that Christians do not actually have anything against them
Unfortunately , though , it will not be possible to get that point across to the Muslims in Iraq
I also , however , deplore the challenging behaviour of Saddam Hussein who has continually managed to ignore the UN resolutions
Most of all I feel sorry for the victims and regret the human suffering that is without doubt much greater than we can imagine
Regre@@ tting and hoping that the war will soon be over is not all that there remains for us to do , however
We still have our responsibility for the future
We must try to alleviate the suffering by immediately making every effort to provide humanitarian aid
We must strengthen our relationships with Arab countries and give the Mediterranean dialogue a real chance to succeed
We must invest as much as possible in a definitive peace process in the Middle East
We must also not forget about repairing transatlantic relationships , whilst enforcing respect for our autonomy
I hope to find this all in the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow
Last but not least , however , we must do all we can to eliminate the divisions in the European Union
Our Member States must use the old , tri@@ ed@@ -and-@@ trusted European formula and talk to each other , even on matters relating to foreign affairs and security policy
There is a working party there that is actively working on foreign policy , and there is also a working party there that is actively working on defence policy
Mr President , I am glad that Commissioner Prodi pointed out the disparity between the financial costs of this war and those available to meet the needs of humanity
Every Spring Summit seems to me like a non-@@ stop re-@@ run of the Delors White Paper
As far as research and development is concerned , let me be positive
As far as environmental protection is concerned , let me highlight intelligent energy , for which I am the rapporteur in this Parliament
This is a programme that was presented many months late by the Commission - it should have started in January this year
That is not efficient , and it is most certainly not competitive and dynamic à la Lisbon Declaration
This programme , I am sad to say , has been cut by the Council
As rapporteur , I am currently weighing up whether to accept a reduced programme which will actually happen or whether to argue for what should happen
Let us be clear that we are not matching our words with deeds
But what is the realistic thing to do now ?
We have to avoid making it more difficult for dialogue between old allies who feel the weight of their responsibility for the world 's future
We must participate in providing humanitarian aid , granting the United Nations the central role of the mandate also in the subsequent stage , in re@@ constructing Iraq
We must heal the rift between Europeans starting with what unites us
This is the challenge that Parliament too must address
We must take steps towards peace - starting with peace in the Middle East - and towards the political unity of Europe
It is therefore perfectly clear to me that what is currently going on in Iraq is in contravention of Item E of the Council Conclusions
Money is being wasted on it rather than being put into sustainable investment
In the United States , it has been estimated that the war will cost USD 90 billion in the best-@@ case scenario , and USD 1 000 billion at worst
We have already gone beyond the best-@@ case scenario , as the war has already gone on longer than the USD 90 billion estimate assumed
That far exceeds the mere USD 50 billion that all the industrial nations together spend in a year on development cooperation
In view of this , we can indeed say that money is being wasted rather than being spent in a sustainable way
Secondly , I get the feeling that sustainable development is being relegated to the bottom of the list even within the European Union
My criticisms are directed not so much at the Council - least of all the country that holds the Presidency , Greece - or the Commission
the keys to Europe 's development are in their hands
I would like to discuss three things
We must place the emphasis on the real economy
I believe , however , that this should also filter through to other files that were mentioned in the summit conclusions
This is called ' coherence of policy '
I would in particular like to mention the takeover directive , the new merger regime and public procurement procedures
It would also be appropriate to place greater emphasis on the effects these have on the economy
I would like to invite the Council and the Commission to tell us how they assess these effects
It is particularly disappointing that it is taking so long for the position to be taken
As far as the task force is concerned , new ideas are always welcome , but it is actions that are most important
